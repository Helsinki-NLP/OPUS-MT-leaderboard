The Prague Stock Exchange goes against business closures in the minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange just at the beginning of Tuesday's business on the break-in of Monday, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time it was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic too, the market's reaction to the outcome of the vote by the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday the shares at the stock exchange in Asia, although the indices could offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was able to cope with some of the losses, thus reducing the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observed the Chinese shares in the stock exchange in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8%, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then lost to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong is determined, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for financial support.
Otherwise, other countries would be threatened by the break-in.
A Blood Bath of American Shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush's view was that the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, and it had reported a similar break in 1987.
The index had already been reduced before the vote, but there was hardly any sign that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free case.
Congress agrees: U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The High Representative of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
This will be agreed on at the beginning of next week.
In talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid for the US financial system, US legislators reached a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion dollars).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressional Members need to discuss some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish the final text of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system is being negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
This was said on Sunday by the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, according to different information, it could probably be agreed on the plan early Wednesday.
According to economists, the plan should be adopted, which is the first important psychological factor for the survival of financial markets.
But then it comes to a "revelation" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice as well.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on how a package to stabilise the market should look," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to your words, it could still come to an end on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the sale of non-marketable mortgage assets by financial corporations that cause financial firms to suffer serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we are on the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also strikingly low in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators have tried to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
This is to reassure investors in the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where a Congress decision could affect business on Monday.
However, until now it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress are voting on the law, there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations in the last minute could not fail to meet a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will experience some changes.
The total amount allocated for the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars are to be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress can block the sale of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at another $100 billion and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto in this decision, the Congress can vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, there remains the basic idea of the programme, based on which funds for the sale of bad mortgage securities, which have been valued, have been obtained because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We have prepared everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His speaker, Tony Fratto, explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "esteem the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limit golden fall screens
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the leading contractor, announced that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called gold case screens for directors of companies participating in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also counts with help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new councils for mortgages that it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and enabling them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological Assistance
The proposed plan, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why, because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among themselves," Marek told the iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek's view is not conclusive.
"It is much more important that Congressional Members agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it is coming to an agreement is at this point the most important," Marek stressed.
Duel on Messers Cut: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can call yet.
So, of course, it looks so good to buy just one phone.
Despite all of this, there are enough reasons why you should join an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims to the future owners.
It is certainly difficult to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Type Rock, Jazz or Blues in the Regal, you probably dream of at least one.
So it is also expressed with the music on travel, that is, with compressed music, simply expressed - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably hardly raise headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life span of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobiles can do doesn't even make them meaningful.
No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, both recording, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you're still involved in smartphones and comms, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small wonder, because no fridge can grill and no television can be photographed.
But the universality of phones also brings benefits.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy frescoes.
Only a few phones can play music for longer than ten or twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this regard, Music Player (especially the easiest) is significantly more powerful.
That's why you should count on cheap phones so they can't play more than a few hours of music.
If you then call again and again, you'd rather buy yourself a charger for the office for safety - that's also true for more expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is if you want to play music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the device has a USB connection, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without reduction with the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
In the case of players you do not need special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves place a music library, sorted by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address list, similar to the Windows Explorer, some may both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should look especially after the lifetime of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and of course also the operating comfort.
If music is mainly music for you and you listen to it every day just for example on the road, then enough is any phone playing MP3 files.
What almost every phone can do.
You also don't have to check which music formats can handle a phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely distributed, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format, using Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why a musical handy should be attached.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and usually only limited to fast radio heat.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, this kind of sales of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) is expected to dominate the music industry in the future.
The phone's mostly with them.
If you want to hear something, grab the phone in the pocket while the player is at home.
However, it comes to whether you are always wearing headphones or at least a wireless free speech device.
If not, you can go back to the integrated speaker that almost every phone has, but only the least MP3 players.
The most important advantage of the musical trades will be for many in the price.
The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is in the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity with the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an improperly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous account for data transfers.
Which device should you grab now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
But be careful.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the cheapest can read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy another priced MP3 player, then catch up with Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will then not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, please take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate operating keys for MP3, and the operating comfort comes thus to the individual MP3 players.
Mostly here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the series Walkman have the same user interface as the individual sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile radio market in the Czech Republic is fairly mature and the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe it won't wait long.
The fact that the Czech mobile operators are working at all in Europe, we have often reported on mobile.cz.
This also confirmed the ČTÚ Telecommunications Authority, which drew attention to the fact that the price for an SMS here is higher than the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming fees, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradox, but there are three mobile networks and a penetration of more than 100% in Czech Republic.
On the other hand, mobile operators would like to argue that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has often said that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network has no more but many opportunities (by the way, he probably would not even find any frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of the virtual provider into the mobile radio market brought a significant price reduction with it, to which the classical mobile providers also had to respond.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices on the UK market as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February this we reported on the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the country's fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which has U:phones in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually like low cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to set a non-climatic target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"The real guy chooses Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the company operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could take place in the Czech Republic as well as in Poland.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepíký also doubted this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service."
In Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem hopeful.
It will come rather to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, a press spokesman for the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic are not quite comfortable with this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Their interest in starting a virtual mobile phone provider has for a long time shown the GTS Novera group that wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed networks, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we were already able to make progress in negotiations," said the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times come now.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until now, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a full virtual provider.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been addressed by a subject with a complex and serious project in this area," he said in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build."
And she adds: "The T-Mobile network will hardly show up a virtual provider by the end of the year.
At this point, we had to have a concrete offer to think so briefly."
Vodafone focuses on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepíký believes: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we considered to be the best from the point of view of our customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with their suppliers hand in hand
It is easy to understand that another provider called more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a fall in profits.
So why should such a competitor facilitate market entry?
The fact that suppliers can draw on a string, when it comes to something, also shows the long turn and turn about the origin of U:phone.
The probably strongest pressure towards ČTU went at the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTU website.
Now, however, just U:phone is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová also noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile phone provider.
In view of the nature of the mobile radio market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would have high requirements on the market itself and in particular its services."
In view of this approach by mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic, which unfortunately - unlike Britain and other highly developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem of his very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible once a contract between a mobile provider and a virtual provider has been concluded over the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classic suppliers," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
The representatives of the suppliers would not surprise such a formulation.
This is more than a matter of concern from an authority that represents consumer interests and should, among other things, ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the rest of the world, where virtual providers are normally working, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction does not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the almost already touching conformity of the three mobile phone providers emerge from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence is on hand.
Just like the absolutely same gas price at the tank stations, it is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not found any indications in this case which indicate action directed against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way on the matter.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so neither does it have the corresponding increased responsibility for its market action.
The instruments needed to open the mobile phone market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÜ, after telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the entry into the market of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for his network.
This means that he is necessarily taking a dominant position in a particular segment.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile phone providers are acting similarly.
A number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) argue that they fall into very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The diversion of responsibility to the ČTU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to implement the newly adopted Telecommunications Act's Novelle to extend the ČTù's competence to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, even though a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know all too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's okay if no one's looking.
Only once remains the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
There are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only partly public.
This is usually the case with companies operating in the area of multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The joke is that the company acts against the operator as a classic company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit similar resales.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be an infringement of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company concerned," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not happen to mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator opposes such an action.
The activities of these companies do not cause them to miss out on profits; at the same time - unlike actual virtual suppliers - they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký points out possible problems: "The law allows such kinds of speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone, so they cannot have full access to it as normal customers of mobile phone providers."
However, at least the ČTÚ had to do this on its own.
There is also a further question for the ÚOHS.
Do mobile providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why do they block themselves from a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to satisfy the supplier's statement that they knew nothing about it and that their business conditions would prohibit this.
When Czech is no longer the most expensive
As already stressed in the text several times, the market entry of virtual providers brought a sharp price decline in the various services with them.
Practically, in all countries where virtual providers have been created, classical providers have tried to prevent their birth virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, regulatory bodies are currently involved, not in any way the interests of mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Whether by means of formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and further followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing themselves into the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot assume that clarity in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider is soon to appear, the Czech mobile phone market may be moving again soon.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interests (to be discriminated against).
And then the Czechs will finally no longer call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented on the occasion of the day of the Czech state in an hour of celebration the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my home country.
The Hymne was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologes sing, in corporal and in an instrumental version.
The song was taken by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymnen versions are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krkek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at once.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech radio that he had selected young, representative voices for the solo variants of the singers, which are marked and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried both and then with the choir to follow a clear dictionary so that you can understand the text well, so that you can have a harmony," said the director.
The Czech National Hymne will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first appeared in 1834 at the stage of the stage theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroop.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strophe of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" hymne
The Prague transport companies also carry on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, Prague transport companies will enter the history as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper card will enter a subway, road or bus.
These can now be purchased by about a hundred thousand people who own the Chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (with effect from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the info centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Museum, Móstek, Nadraží Holesovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letnyany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the Internet since yesterday at www.dpp.cz.
The service was requested by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long hoses for their paper travel.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places the travellers also have a switch with trained staff, who advises Internet customers and also plays the coupon on the map," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-handling machines on the Opencard, which are placed in some subway vestives.
How do such automatics look?
They are red, remember drivers, the passengers may have already seen them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"At present there are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an auto instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to enter the chip card, and the coupon you previously purchased is playing on your own.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region reached the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport, the train crews have read-asides with which they can check the validity of the Coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the Ropid organisation.
The suburban buses have card reading devices at the driver's box.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown at the driver, but the open card must be placed at a designated place on the side of the box.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, it is not easier than the driver to ask for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive by suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can again go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The South called for a nationwide decision by the United States
In 1945 the Germans had asked for the membership of the Böhmerwald to the United States.
This comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945 some groups of Germans have turned to the presidents of the United States.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been kept in a private archive and which is now stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask in the letter to the American President, he is not going to allow the return of the "Southern Gauss" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich Agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and really want to make sure that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People whose hearts are the destiny of the South."
Since the accession of the Sudet Germans to Czechoslovakia - in recognition of the Czech national character - suggests that they would expect brutality, indifference, ignorance, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American Presidents to take over the Bohmer forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that you have, without regard to the view of a quarter million people in this area, contacted a foreign state for us, oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities, and have not contributed anything at all to the victory of the Allieds," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is apparently the fear of rachet lists of the "Czech Underpressors".
If the President of the United States had doubts about the Germans' minds, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a national decision in Böhmerwaldgau on whether the inhabitants of the United States would become or would live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war history may sound somewhat naïve, it does, according to some historians, draw a good picture of the then expectations of the Germans.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to deny at least that they would be negotiating their resignation from the Republic, only a few of them had such an opportunity at all.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a type of autonomy for the South.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed in the war as Budweiser Deutscher at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he arrived in British prison at the end of the war and was taken to a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to bring them to the Czech Republic.
"They believed if they came home, they would get the Czech," says Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia thought that they would be evicted from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decree.
You don't think so!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action for security on the streets in the Czech history.
This is also the way the emotional-driven media campaign, which wants to start the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday, was characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš Rébíček promises to bring drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, on the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take the driver from too fast traffic and alcohol to tax.
And they also remind themselves of the need to get on the road.
The campaign will focus on young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spot?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
Of this the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies:
You don't think so!
The words "not thinking" are in capital letters on a sign.
And in a blood smile, the word "pay".
This should mean that you can pay attention for a moment with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where you can see very normal images with drastic images of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic accidents on the Czech streets.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar beet and peaches for drivers
"For the riders, the moto is sugarbrot and peitsch.
Sugar powder means that, for example, when they drive at red, they save time.
The scourge is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
That is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says psychologist.
Even less effective are his views on tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in the exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, when peace with Palestine and Syria could be exchanged.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Acronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert said against the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would also include Oster Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozer to roll over his legs as one of my best friends has to give up on a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in a play on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and holy and historic places" located in the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction of the Golan Height
Olmert spoke of a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan height, which he considered to be an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone and alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan-Height," said Olmert.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship to Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the (Shitic) Hisbollah movement; they will have to give up their continued support to the (Shitic) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Dishhad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewarts on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know her, in a remote bus the rerouting is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewarts and travellers can go back and forth on the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to adhere strictly and formally to the law, the activity of a Stewart is in opposition to the road traffic law," said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, when a two-and-twenty-year-old Stewartes died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was at this point in the accident next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake in which the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter even with parking spaces.
If this is not provided in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The student agency's remote bus has no parking space; as confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jancúra, against Aktuální.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not first agree with the movement of travellers.
Later, this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus on which travellers can go to the toilet during the journey when they have their seat," he told his position.
The law doesn't know a Steward
"There is no clear legal explanation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the concept of vehicle drivers; however, its rights and obligations are not defined," adds Hanzelka's spokesman.
On the other hand, the Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorny, believes that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It is clear whether the bus in the product authorisation also has parking places.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are parking lots and the maximum speed is limited, coaches with parking lots and a higher allowed speed and distance buses without parking lots with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Horín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewarts on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid journey, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Nor is it safe here when turbulence comes, and the Stewardness can hit its head."
"But if a bus breaks sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or on a road.
The safety of Stewarts must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jancúra is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency offers Stewards's services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that Steward's profession is risky, I'll take it off.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers when entering.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin founded the lack of Stewarts in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have Stewarts, but we've been fighting from the beginning.
sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not spoken for Týden.cz a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the case of an accident on a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was unhappy who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off without glancing from the stop strip and had blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre but collided with the right front with the truck.
That the two seats were sold for the Stewarts, Jancura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to report truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the judgment, but it expects a financial compensation from the defendant.
An amendment?
Not Visible
A more detailed arrangement for the movement of Stewarts on board a bus could bring a legal arrangement to which a thirty-six-year expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the road," says Fachmann Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of the Stewards as something that could seriously endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, while controlling the safety of buses in the jurisdiction of the police and the labour security authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
Large words are not missing from the letter of the WestLB board to the members of the house.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurter Deca Bank, it is possible to create "the central capital market house of the savings group", says the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB included a "competence block" with sustainable yield in such a business.
And at all times, such a link can be the decisive link between further mergers in the domestic banking sector.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the hit WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Agency, which the North Rhine-Westphalia Government has recently made it clear that it is time to find a solution for the future.
From a connection between the Deca bank, the savings customers know about their investment fund, and WestLB has been speaking for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chief Franz Waas has known at the end of August when the semi-annual figures were presented, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Management Board of the Deca, which is carried out in half of the Land Banks and Savings Associations, has commissioned the Board to hold discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks are free, so it says in the financial square, just started.
From the Deca bank, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important employers in the financial sector in Frankfurt, this is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as if the Deca bank could merge with the Rhineland-Pfalz Landesbank and Helaba.
However, nothing came from this triangular bond.
The plans were barely public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of Helaba.
So the other two houses did not find each other.
The Rhineland-Pfalz Landesbank went instead to the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank in Stuttgart.
However, there has always been thought games about a connection between the Deca bank and state banks.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Board, had recently spoken against planning to join his house.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature that there is a need to disrupt the different houses of the public-law sector.
After the elections in Bavaria have been held, the BavarianLB could, as the first link to the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank could get closer.
For Helaba this is not necessarily good news.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, it will go on and on with the partners.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far experienced the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Again, in association with the West LB, the Sparkassen- and Giroberband Hessen-Thüringen, which is 85 percent involved in the Helaba, precipitated a row at the beginning of the year.
Stay the North LB anyway.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June Merl expressed the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future viability of the national banks if the German savings and giroverband had not so far been answered.
At the end of the day, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is, of course, not desirable there.
In the letter of the Board of Directors, this is also the case, in any case a "total solution" will be sought for the house.
As the combination of individual units with the Deca bank can be put under a hat, it will still show.
The second weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena's like his girlfriend with her, and so everything's different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer phase of the brand Kaiser, stands a massively built bartender and proves the approximately 200 October-fest travelers, which deep tones can produce its throat.
Elena gives Luca a hug, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova train station will start at 23.45 a.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della brewa", arrival expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And that's what Marco Guarda says, that's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat of fur and a glasses with broad silver straps, belongs to the bus.
For five years they've been driving to the October party, three tours are alone this year.
Night to night, day to day on the Wiesn, at 2:30 p.m.
Nights would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the ride, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, married faithfully to the Bavarian offer of purity, the health insurance and the German travel management - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses are already rolling into the night, on the highway towards Brennero.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers will sleep.
Well, they'll still need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, there are also several other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at about half seven o'clock in the morning, they are already on the other 50 buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a last call, explains the attack plan.
First: Set up the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in Fracture, including the Internet address of Marco's travel office: "conocersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer cellar, it's called running!" Marco calls in in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not before, otherwise we block, and not all of the jaundice on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, which brulles Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the drinking money.
"The security people show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave your homes, they will be gone."
Third, "Today evening point eleven again here!" Understand?
And now it's on the map.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as a roadmark to the trees, to paintings and even to the electorate of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It is known as "Italian Weekend".
There are no precise figures; the speech is 50 000 who make their way across the Alps and fall into the beers, ten percent of all visitors are to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a nationwide statistics in which Italians are the first to stand before Britain (approximately 60 troops) and Austrians (approximately 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular among Italians is the court brazelt.
Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and even implied that the German banking sector would not be excluded from the crisis developments.
Because it's now on the weekend.
The Munich Real Estate Financer (HRE) noted in Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence on the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said on Monday Reuters that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate had only to do with the part which it also claimed.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
There are losses to the daughter of Deffa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state finance provider has refinanced itself in a very short period of time - which is no longer possible due to suspicion of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank's shareholding was reduced by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio was slightly lower than 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero over the previous year, revenues from subscriptions to claims and certain securities, and from the resolution of repayments in the credit business decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only through higher income from the reimbursement of post-commissioned accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest after the tax system and from the business provision for group companies, the income reduction was still moderately dropped by around 16 percent.
The former state financier had initially speculated after privatization in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which were then split into the Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of merit in classical state funding, the Deffa had then increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make subscriptions that will have a "essential material effect" on the gain and loss of the group, it is quite uncertain.
The fact is that the dividend was removed.
Already in 2007, it was reduced by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state- and infrastructure financeer since the depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent on the refinancing of the interbank market than other institutions as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks is largely lost, as the banks have their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a share - around 50 billion euros - of the depfa credit portfolio short-term funds for refinancing each year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the group's funding needs are covered by the credit at a time that is set aside and the company is shielded from "the influence of the currently largely inefficient international money markets".
From other sources, it is heard that the funds will be secured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE President Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to rely on the cash markets at the appropriate time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Centre (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inevitable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After the company is still before insolvency on the late Sunday day, the minimum temporary rescue may not calm the farmers.
The share price falls by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the loan rates are quite good.
If the priority debts are shown to be less mobile, the rates of post-insurance loans are more clear.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the maturity over 2009.
If Hypo-Real State Loans appear to be a speculative investment option, their value must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following a clear increase in the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over from the depfa.
As long as notable banks, governments and less-sponsored business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to obtain a timely payment of pensions.
Or what is happening is what is not yet expected - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the above-mentioned messages from the sub-State, only a legitimate hope has now become based on the likelihood of security.
This should, above all, allow long-term believers to prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use a closing line to generate a loss income for future payment tax payments on interest-rate gains later on.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is scheduled to introduce herself on the first day of school at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to look at: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells from Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Right before school, I had cotton.
I live on the Tokyo border towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone. Luckily, I didn't walk.
The beginning of teaching does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive at eight o'clock until about twenty-nine a short discussion with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lesson started, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I am not the type who likes to talk to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I had not yet had a form of school, I wore an old dress of my mother's, blue knees, and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pull and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already begun to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all changed, looked and trembled and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It is one of the most important words of Japanese girls and means 'nothing, sweet'.
Then I'm stuck in my seat fast.
The girl next to me was pretty broad, she found it an honor for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was regularly stormed.
Everyone talked to each other and kichered and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all their bentos were picked up.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is something different than the fateful German breaks.
I had rice with herbs, small herbs, lettuce and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Mostly I don't have any bruises, which I eat right here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, up to the salty plums, maybe, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which then she performs especially artificially - in the hope of getting to know the boy at breaktime.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm worried if I can see this here, too.
'Why is Japan calculated?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me once."
Finally, I've been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And so that I can understand comics and culture better, I started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weak for tradition, seats and weddings.
And you put great value on this.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I still haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that it also feels afraid?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same way if they behave the way we do?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has published the contributions of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers in a series to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions without me or anyone else proving this until now where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we should at least hope that all human brains will have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply other species and cut out questions of feeling or of general consciousness, we enter unreasonably because the hardware does not agree.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it is dying, fleeing or attacking.
People behave similarly to what some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
For one thing, the switch circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primitives, and it seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal Cortex, including knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primitives.
Another dramatic characteristic must lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case animals could be excluded.
However, even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may also be available, is probably very different from most of our consciousness conditions.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, because of special hardware, can be analysed on the basis of our own experience, his research presents great problems.
Most of my performances relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the consciousness that should be scientifically easier to access.
One could examine the processes of the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of Primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one relies on the neural correlations of consciousness rather than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also underlines the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the state of visualisation.
What happens now to the feelings?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a conscious brain in its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like physical reactions) is recorded.
In this way, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, the primates and especially to people.
Related to the linguistic nature are fine degrees of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize conditions with the help of words and grammar to add others to us.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from more primitive activities in the regions of the cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could be involved in completely transverse feelings.
In theory, I can't contradict it, but it's unproveable.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and people like fear, probably also in both cases: How can you check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similar?
A sheep flees in danger, even if it feels afraid?
In my eyes, only behavioral visibility can not yet prove the same.
Although the neural comparison continues: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people: how did you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (we know?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress is being made here at the neural level, provided that the same is observed in rats and humans.
Just as I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I have feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You can keep it brief, but I'd rather go ahead than walk against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts go back.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian Union President Grigory Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The Polish association PZPN's leadership has been suspended following numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and has been replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
At the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki, the Commission met.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparations for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several initialists were convicted only in the past season of manipulation due to forced entry, and eventually even the League's start had to be moved in a short time.
Employer Dennis Quaid hits back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan evicted her pregnant Dennis Quaid as a husband.
He shakes - and hits back.
Later rose war at the former spouse Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an uncooperative fight with each other - in all the public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle for the first time last week, Meg Ryan said for the reasons for the failure of his marriage: "This was a long time before I was unfaithful, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud has only been experienced after divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a marriage break is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband fell out clearly: "Unfortunately" was, the 54-year-old said of "New York Daily News", that "Meg once again buys and covers the history of our relationship".
It is also "suffering" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and revolutions that mean a separation for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and has recently become father to twins.
And so close his entries with the page height: "My life goes on anyway.
I'm happy I have a wonderful family that's going well."
Discount prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper according to a current study of up to 50 percent.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant break in the second quarter.
After prices have increased on the hotel market for many years, the overnight stays have already taken place in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
Most clearly, the trend in Paris and Rome was where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
For this reason, American Express sees the weak dollar course that has led to a "absorbing tourist destination" of American tourists.
Financial locations such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the drop in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increase by 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
Also at the air fares, the trend showed up in the first quarter:
Because of the kerosene pollution, passengers in the economy class had to pay more 7.1 percent on average than in 2007, fuel intensive long-distance flights became even more expensive to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for cheap flights from the economy to the previous quarter decreased by 12.5 percent, but price changes were much lower in the business and first class.
In Germany, prices were even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices rose 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights the prices have even been half-priced, according to the study.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for the price collapse is the lagging economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the flight market is broken.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure through the Open Skies Agreement which liberalises air transport between the USA and Europe.
The signs of the tense situation are the elimination of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines registered in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a door and simple method, the Hamburger SV becomes a table guide.
Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning Elf at Borussia.
From Kristoffer Klein enlarges bridge landing for national players Marko Marin.
The gladbacher came into the game soon and shook with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger finished in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Many were not out in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger was almost three decades old physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoyed a higher view than some smooth actor.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nibbled and lifted the dams accordingly.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg Chief Coach Martin Jol.
Its command is similar to: Here with two gates!
The implementation remained unimplemented.
"It wasn't nice to see everything today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wished for more.
The 1:0 (1:0) have to thank the Hamburgers for the headball hit by Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that very weak gladbacher couldn't hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the flashboards on the video wall, which proved their association to be class premiere.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to sort this out," said Marcel Jansen.
He recognizes that the tableware is more for the incalculableness of the league than for the domination of his HSV.
The team with its late-binding access - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torschutz Petric and the Jansen from the FC Bayern - is not able to shine, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," asked Jol.
After the vote
On Wall Street, the fear is gone.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily broke Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught up with something.
At 20:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer with good five percent in the minus at 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
At that time, the biggest loser was in the Dow American Express, which had nearly 14 percent of the bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
Could not get a title.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs Bank amounted to almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago Großinvestor Warren Buffet had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called false mortgages.
However, the amount should not be paid at any rate, but in a step-by-step manner.
On the other hand, the State should receive stock option certificates from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the State funds.
Share prices in Europe and the USA in the downwards
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States does not resolve the investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German Grand Bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and melts down the dax.
The US Dow Jones index loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have made the German Share Index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The share of the München real estate financeer lost three quarters of its value, despite the rescue action by the federal government and private banks, which accounted for more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly ran under the psychologically important 6000 point mark and scored with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets went into the knees all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with clear losses.
Investors feared that the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package of the U.S. government could not be enough to repress the financial markets.
The dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which could follow the vote in the Senate on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London the FTSE index was initially 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leadership index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743,61 numerators.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index rose by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the index of conductivity lost 506,43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 counters.
In the MDax, Arcandor’s shares reported a capital increase after the announcement.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The Group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been providing for research for inadvertentness: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manover.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins could not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel lines, you are now threatening your cold death.
Among scientists there has been a mysterious phenomenon of confusion for years - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight control of space probes where they receive additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of the earth.
This will save the probes a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What researchers have been surprised at for years, however, is that the flight bodies do not behave 100 percent as expected by the old-fashioned gravitational law.
Instead, there are irregularities at the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins, which describes the attractiveness of matter by bending the space, could not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein is not mistaken, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronomers have invented in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
From the existence of dark matter, space researchers have only known for about ten years.
Obviously, it is an attractive force whose effect on other celestial bodies can be seen.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, which means it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark matter makes up well one fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists dragged into Egypt will be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros.
In the case of a shooting before the release, six hostages were to be killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Remuneration negotiations are already under way.
Again and again, Germans entered the viewer of Kidnappern.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists dragged in the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports by the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking her health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions were likely and safely reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: the kidnappers were ready to finish the execution, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the officer said.
It was "only to receive the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two of them were arrested.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" called on a German mediator to delay the release of hostages because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men should be detained for as long as the kidnappers have a safe flight route.
The German message in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather " led to suicide"
The long-standing abuse by her stepfather has led to the death of a woman, reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stythians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro found that he regularly arrested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Treise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle moved to her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Treise had tied her eyes together before committing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a guesthouse.
Treise and his wife separated in the 1980s and he went back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court found that Mrs Randle, who worked for a large part of her time in honour of the National Trust, was persecuted for abuse which she had been added twice a week.
State Attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been an avid surfer and bicycle driver, had been "emotionalally dead" since 2006 and had given up "their lives"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she died by sticking through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of approval, who ended up saying, "I kept her tied up and tied her eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been scary, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse yet, the fact is that it is very unlikely that the case would have been brought before the court if she had not done so."
He added: "I am aware of the effects that Stephanie's father and mother had on her daughter over the years, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother.
Otherwise she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official responsible for lost data shall be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged under the Public Security Act.
The man was appointed by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
There is the weakest accusation within the law and there is no reference to criminal intent.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would have been the case within the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged, in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, with the clause relating to the safe storage of information.
The Royal Public Prosecutor recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he submitted contained classified assessments on Al-Qaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Apartment building companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could spend more than 80 million pounds on the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving the money from investors, including 59 construction companies
The Director General of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "inconvenient", that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's credit is paid.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that accept the deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently ... are now called up to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold and that companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will run at 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to raise 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have acted prudently during the property accumulation are now called up to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the coming weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will fall for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are both non-companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People on Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after an investigation of a consulting company.
The retailers themselves should decide whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk changed last in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said that the Court of First Instance refused to press charges of 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released early this month against bail.
Sheikh Hasina was to return to Bangladesh next week, but her party, the Avami Bondis, demanded that the military-supported transitional government grant her unlimited freedom at first.
The correspondents say that although their detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear whether they could remain free when returning to Bangladesh.
Your lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasinas' bail request because it says that she does not have to receive bail because she is already in detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers argue that they need bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami U.S. president on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military-supported transitional government took over the power, but in June she was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Threats about the anti-polo-initiative in Afghanistan
In Afghanistan's recent anti-Polio initiative, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence brought into contact with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations launched an immunization programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to one UN speaker, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or prevent the thousands of personnel who were being vaccinated.
BskyB loses complaint in case ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The competition court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and enables it to influence the broadcaster ITV more unfairly.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by renouncing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, successfully on the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB would raise doubts about the independence of the ITV, which the Competition Commission has moved to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Attorney General's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special prosecutor to deal with the termination of the nine state prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The case was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticized the officials of the Weissen House, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by the fears that the lawyers had been suspended for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the investigators interviewed during the investigation have angels to prevent justice.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special mediator with the power to force the witnesses to speak was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when in December 2006 the Ministry of Justice kidnapped nine U.S. state prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that public prosecutors would be dismissed because of weak work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed state prosecutors were not worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-level members of the Republican Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of the electoral fraud of the Democrats.
US U.S. Attorneys are hereby ordered to investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been arrested for his dismissal and has brought his office to an end.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also announced.
In particular, the report by the Inspector-General addressed the role of Gonzales by having the 'main responsibility' for the dismissals, 'responsibility' for his leadership role and 'extremely disinterested' in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loops Epistic Song to Be Honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title piece of Meat Loaf's Hitler album from 1977.
"Coldplay" introduces the nominations for the award this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the journal "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain as a single for sale in 1979 and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heart beats after he was broke up on stage.
In 2007, he had to give up concerts due to an acute cholera fever.
Later it was known that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, solos, side roads and other surrounding roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
However, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty gas than a actively used road.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
However, this street has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repaste Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
The other consignees belong to the long-standing neighborhood, which says they are fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Land Use of the Municipality this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have proposed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers to keep the road in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, says Susan Stitzer, the district administrator in the municipality 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street will set up new plasters and seats that are designed for, among other things, a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it did not want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate these obsolete gases and make them a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Department for Building Protection, thought that it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street had its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was split between his numerous children and a narrow striped country was claimed by no one.
The back door of the CBGB Music Club, the Punkrock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most famous for the photo on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of shrouts, lamps and parts of fibers, posters, leaves and wires.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property should remain as modest as it is.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged divider of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (titled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), published a part of the talk of the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the journal "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, at that time wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow pocket gas that even remains dark for days and is characterized by broken metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and rain girls over flying weekly newspapers."
With few exceptions, the road looked just as soon as it was in the evening.
A rat walked through the back of the road, not far from the door that led earlier to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were visible on the walls and an empty bottle of beer lay on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of lined newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished something.
Fields added that, in his opinion, some people underestimated the travel of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and ugly.
Debate on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, leader of scientific staff in California studies and director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example.
Obama's campaign mentions that "the probability of successfully finishing school in African-American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students" - which is correct.
In order to close this gap of performance, Obama’s education plan recommends, among other things, a two-lingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question is whether Obama’s use of bilingual training, which puts the emphasis on teaching in other languages than English, is contrary to his interest in reducing distance in school performance.
As an example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are Hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, 100 percent of the fourth grade students had passed the state examination in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprising were 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year in the English exam as well.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach after which the training takes place in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point that Obama should take into account, according to the school manager Linda Mikels.
This approach puts value on the almost exclusive use of English in the teaching of faculty.
Ms. Mikkels, who denied the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and no longer be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's services would make it easier to answer this question, but the educational positions within its own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the distance of performance, he should take careful account of education models that work instead of denying them and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases due to renewed fears about the economy
On Monday, the oil price fell sharply because of the fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets could not be able to revive the economy again.
The New York Stock Exchange's crude oil-term business fell by 7 percent per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has been reduced by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and by strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were concerned again, even though congressional representatives had announced that they would have agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the greatest in history.
This message was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup purchases the bank business of the Watchovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial groups Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the intense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears that it was not possible to live the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts of the German Bank have written to investors in a communication that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they will continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is expanding worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank’s analysts corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the following year and reduced their oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been more frequent in the last eight and a half years than anyone else in the Jets Trikot.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumphal procession.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
After a sneaky game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-year-old touchdown, it marked the perfect performance for a afternoon on which their developing cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once emerged as an outpost defender and the next 10 seconds before the end of half-time.
"I didn't make a special effort," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While playing Favre and Coles prisoners, the defense took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis started a unfortunate throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and took him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then made sure he lost Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds in the game when the jets returned the ball and Jay Feelly turned a 20-yard shot into 34 to 0 leadership.
These were the most points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said: "I believe I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Squeeze-squeezed celery beats its world record
Haile Gebrssässie from Ethiopia has shown again why some hold him for the best long run at all times, after he broke his own record on Sunday in Berlin, and became the first person to make the 42.2 kilometers route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59 Gebrselasia has improved its previous score of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselse, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his diverse career, in which he has reached at least one world championship title or a world record on each track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrslassie released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing that it might have been exaggerated later that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the start of the sun and at 9 degrees and 13 degrees at the target - has won gearbox with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Gebrslassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long lines, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrsesasia reported to the press, he would have had seizures in his Wade two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently he has been refreshed after break and not recovered.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything is perfect.
I took the training back a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end everything was great."
He was criticised for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he is excessively orchestrated in his race course, many of the world's best marathon stars generally refrain from relying too much on the race's leaders as if it were a train race, and put world record over the competition.
However, this criticism does little harm to the size of the belt straps as long-run runners.
accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselasia had reached the centre of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrseslassie after leaving the tempomas.
A little over three miles before the finish, Gebrselasia made its last entry to separate from Kwambai, who arrived as a second at 2:05:36 and thus improved its best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germany, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
Last spring the 36 years old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She has missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as rear injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She had planned her course by leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only to leave, but after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third at 2:25:01.
The pride and the traps in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growth of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles away from the gliding, loud and gigantic drives, is a quiet city in which the pride and complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crockets, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that it describes – and it made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced by the German writer project at the time of depression – in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, busy and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what's going on with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, called for an open debate on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a town resident and a community member of the oldest church in the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is on the one hand a capital of literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and on the Hut.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as here all Hurston called.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading by the often forgotten centre of Florida to the plains of black history and human drama.
Frech and Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston readers led to the loading of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "there is the brown-white-strung modern school, with its fenced gardens and playgrounds, to take care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Sold drinks of every kind and what-too-always fits hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus linked Eatonville with self - denial, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls lived the Hurston, quoting the men who sang about their beauty, who were full of sexual toys.
She added, "Many people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson here as a lively eccentrician who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to the city, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today reflects something on her dignified style of dress.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, and many of them did not.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he was shaking in his chair, on a terrace behind the Sabelia Lake, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and buried her books.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous tomb.
In Eatonville there was no big memorial, no public readings in the great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-way motorway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-way main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4 motorway through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial confusion brought hatred into the Community.
"At this time often a bunch of white boys came and they threw oranges and soap on the people who were sitting away," said Mr Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel to force the Supreme Court to integrate by calling his decision in Brown's case against the school council as "politically respecting my race".
Today, residents say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its young people.
"Black children were used to getting hugged - I remember - they hugged their teachers in the morning and hugged their teachers in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville Community.
This could be maintained for so long, added them until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have turned their backs on prejudices, as they have done, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made a nameless tomb on his way to Hurston and began to fight for the restoration of her fame.
Five years later, a popular Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshops and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The remote street project came at just a time when the most famous daughter in Eatonville was once again in public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many returned for the celebration.
A few years later, the district withdrew from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-story road gave way to the city, speeded up the whole at peak speed, aroused real citizens' pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said something simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote street project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There came more and more trips, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church since 1993, and locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new unique library (of course named after Hurston) opened on Kennedy Boulevard in 2006.
Today, Eatonville is still a specialty in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre can feel like a backdrop in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is today to 90% black.)
Outside looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval in the foreground is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a white man and represented by black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival was growing, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and lazy, albering and interspersing like any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who planned to return after college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police station, who might need some help, according to him.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you speak fluently of financial Latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York have been having the worst horror day ever since the 1929 stock exchange tour.
The suppliers still drive the metal tea scales along the citizens' stairs and carry tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still revolves between apartments, how human packers are loaded with the 50 curved T-shirts that hang on a joch-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for food on their breakfast bag on the steps of the citizens and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 16 and 19 hours.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided on Thursday afternoon to open a new savings account because of all the World Cup.
Although I had decided to put my duty on a quiet afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already standing.
Not to be paid to the money changers to collect or deposit money, but to the customer service switch where family customers order cheques, tourists ask for the way to Macy's shop and where to open new customer accounts.
Most of the time, I learned from Starr, my "personal bank employees with license", for the same reason as I did snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places where they were hanging out, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from the so-called trifts (a little like a building park), social banks and those local savings that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 of these banks were silent and silent.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with facilities of $327 billion, in competition management over and as last Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank with savings facilities worth $440 billion, looking for a life-saving buyer.
In fear of another storm, the office and cargo officers who stood before me brought their bar to a bank that is considered safe harbor, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have adapted themselves to a liquid financial Latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese family supermarket took as much confidence in Lehman Brothers, the bank that went to the court and their dismembered board president Dick Full as she would read about a false colleague.
And Lyn, around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my dwelling block, came from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any more chances."
Muscle tombs broken during the Law Rut in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing director of the Austrian Right-Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Devinter, a member of the Belgian Right-Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamism".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is painted, crossed with a red line.
The police are accusing law-enforcement extremists of exaggeration at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extremely right party, of registering significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night of Friday to-morrow, more than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Friedhof in Traun near Linz in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators scattered Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials hold this as an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way associated with the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "most deeply frightened" about the message of the gravest revolt that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan ends.
At the same time, there is a round of consciousness research in Austria after the country moved right in the narrow parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which received almost 30% of the votes from both far right-wing parties, took part in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their speeches were criticised by opponents as foreign enemies.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, engaged in a ban on headaches and burkas and even made his refusal to food known, which is generally linked to Islam.
In his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minerals with the argument that these political symbols of continuous Islamism are Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election and the affirmation that the extreme rights of the political strongest bloc are in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barriers for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar who was convicted of the sexual abuse of children, was sentenced to travel to France and Spain.
Glitter set up a six-month suspension after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted last Thursday to suspend a foreign travel ban after presenting to the judges evidence of Glitter's pre-trial punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the correct name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Court in Kent, but was represented by the Attorney General Cork Binning.
In a speech from the Court of Justice, he reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police at the Ashford Court asked for permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd wasn't personally present."
As required by the Register for Sexual Penalties, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible residence in the country.
A spokesperson for Kent's Police Unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect the residents of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport check and he flew to Hong Kong alone and here.
The Chinese authorities also refused his entry and fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22nd, he came to Heathrow in Heathrow and remained there during his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's office in West London, as Scotland Yard had been successful in asking permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter was arrested in 1999 for 4 months in the United Kingdom because of the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flamencotenders who refuse to concentrate and dedicate themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are foreign to the public, I know when for the personality I can find typical gestures, the depth of a stolen look or strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatres on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame-coding at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the month of the flamenco photography, reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day, on the other hand,' explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sorrow, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, there is no need to take pictures on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to keep the characters of the greatest flamemakers with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', took a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remember classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, thereby giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises each day'.
These are not only the dance, the song or the instrumental play, but the personality of the artist, his character, which with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for something that becomes visible in the form of the hearing, of being, was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the near future.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize it as "portraits of the veterans of sport" ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, I like the photographer `it very much to photograph people, to know them and to move me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult type.
You meet or hit people, personalities you sometimes don't even know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the Flamenco today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is displayed in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Rome he's just writing is "a great holiday."
He does not yet know where the Roman action is taking place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to continue the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for 20 years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival, the favorite Nobel Prize winner said that the project he is dealing with is "a customs cuisine" and "everything indicates that he should not write the novel".
'If I were alone, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime', so he concluded his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding characters at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the award of the Hay Festival and most of the audience gave her voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and is seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience before him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who had a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through it all again: how his call for literature came from ‘extraordinary adventure’, how he wanted to experience joy at reading’ and ‘more from’ than before’; how he writes and ‘discipline’ to complement his lack of inspiration’, how his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his call and what ‘discipline’ are the basics of his history.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is no way of measuring and how you can know whether books change life, but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience,” stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is "caused effects" and "people bring even more disunity", so I asked the writers "do not abandon the ease" and "responsibility" for his vocation.
At the feast in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: the bullfighters fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in poor condition, the bullfight with which the feast in Pozoblanco was to be concluded was moved to the morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to move the bullfight.
Thus, the festival of unsustainable weather was exposed, so two of the three festivals could not be held.
On Saturday it rained, because the second scheduled match could not be celebrated.
The group of the Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who entered the Stierfarena.
That's how there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after leaving the pass with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same night, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his art of fighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience reacted to his second fight with buh-runs.
In Álava, two people wanted to leave their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport checks in Ertzaintza, in the region of Armiñon (Alava).
Two policemen called on the driver of the car to stop, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they shouldn't stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police chased her and found one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the transport police in the region of Alava had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
She decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police began the chase until the car was parked a few kilometers on the edge. At the moment, the drivers came out of the car to fly across a rural road into a forest area.
The police of the city Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 Kilo Haschisch, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to the precise laboratory analysis and balance of the bundle to other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was ‘double’, so that it did not match the marks given in the Kfz papers, therefore, there was an additional arrest for falsification of official documents.
The police of Ertzaintza continues to investigate the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was taken to a police station for arrest.
Actor Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
One Witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a fairly rare way, and spokespersons of the California traffic police reported to the magazine `People'.
The Witness explained in detail that after 4:30 p.m., Locklear pushed the gaspedal and made a lot of noise, trying to move her car from behind or forward from the parking garage, and when she went back, she caught her sunglasses a few times.
A little later the Witness, who at first the actress probably didn't realize that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and left the car.
The witness was the person who warned the emergency service because she was worried about Locklers.
When the police raids arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car who was standing across the street blocking traffic.
'They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol centre to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actor showed himself to be cooperative, excessive alcoholism was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials as a result, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug’, says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving an indefinite substance which could not be determined and was brought to a local investigation at 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares is responsible for the Andalusian Association of the United Left for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazeras, the chief coordinator of the VL and Members of the United Left, today has ensured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will meet the decision in the case of the former Council for Youth and Sport of the Council in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, the last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take over the responsibility for this,' Llamazars pointed out what the party must have to do with what it has to do with, which has so far been sitting as a city council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rules that could have begun: 'The VL has always insisted that such cases will receive maximum transparency'.
In this regard, he stressed that education has a strict code of ethics for all public officials.
'Sangre de Mayo': Helm of Garcia
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós 'Episdios Nacionales', José Luis Carci in `Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the Spanish's famous rise against the French. This is a wonderful film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for spin-making.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to represent a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci today explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
‘Sangre de mayo’ with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinemas and later shown on the broadcaster Telemadrid as a four-hour ministry.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this work, his work was carried out as a child's stream. He thanked Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid, to make a memorial film for the second century festival in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the story was based on "Epiosios Nationales", he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for rotation offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing the image of the 'confused Spain' who chose the false leader for the struggle because the people were rejected by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to calculate with funding such as at `Alatriste' or 'Los phantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as at `Sangre de Mayo'), so some scenes from the spinbook with Horacio Valcárcel, who worked with Garcia almost his entire career, could not be converted.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in 'Volver a empezar', has been involved in his usual way of working: he was on stage with the actors with whom one must first try to turn before and for those who had not made casting, he appeared to be `depressing' and respectful, `a part of the film director's profession exists in order to help in the theater and in the cinema to know what is happening in the film industry in which one works.'
Many performances he meets in 'Sangre de Mayo' have to repeat before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de Mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles cegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
At first you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you notice that it is only for the soul, and now you are satisfied when you have produced a film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the dancer from Seville Tortola Valencia
A flamencotender from Seville adores a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusierin (Georgian Valencia Valenzuela), who was born in the Triana District and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert for Oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and was committed to the abolition of the corset, which limited the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinates Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell you about her life, but to keep her spirit,' said the flame dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
"The dance of the butterfly" came to me, for example, like Guajira, or "the dance of the snake" like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic field', she claims.
The scene includes two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La porta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
"Matilde plays Tortola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The stage also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Juarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were the Divas in whom he always fell in love again.'
In this work we are also told in a certain way by the life of this woman, who has been known in such places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works today are no longer and therefore she knows even less," Bayón claims.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta nuien cadado' also includes the trienium
The presentation of the first illustrative edition of "Dario de un poeta cien cadado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married 1916 Zenobia, offers a suitable atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the "Trinium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008). The goal is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the literary Nobel Prize and the death day of both.
This concludes the Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón with the new edition of this work, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia House Museum, and with the hiking exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luscía', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, New York was now reached and presented during the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta nuién cadado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
Without Paul Newman, the U.S. may have a bad appearance
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This set comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in the "sensation reporter", and from the then ruling idea of the American cinema, which was left in the loop, from all over America to Newman with his exciting idea and followed.
Now look what it cost him to lend him Oscar.
And when he left in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a great blow for all.
‘What one feels at times is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,’ said Robert Redford crying, ‘my life and my country were the greatest difficulties of his life.’
No one was afraid to laugh or exaggerate.
As the ‘father’ of the cinema and the country, he died at a sad moment, in fear of terrorists and of market collapse, in which the defeated self-esteem of the US Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If only a few people can be admired in this hard time without paying tribute, then you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as gains: from the foundation that ordered the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage who died at overdose, he was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort for him to pursue a deadly food culture.
A wide range of surprises makes it difficult for Hollywood to take home without regard for nationality and nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but all age.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar award winner, said that working with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the greatest of us all," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today are trying to live faithful as Paul Newman lived: getting high demands on justice, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's medieval jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He got divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities to be there.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a home file?’ he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily customary in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was as proud as the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the Philanthropist' they say.
The streets in Madrid are missing for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to hold some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the 2012 failure, but it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it is wrong!
She was called the perfect road, and according to my opinion, she was the worst road with all the drum and drain that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if one would observe the evaluation and I could check it, that would clearly not have happened.
But from the start, we're going through everything.
The nonsense starts with the ticket holler that allows you to go first.
I don't think it's bad either, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid staus on the street).
So don't.
Here they let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that exists only to go there) and (after an endless wait) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
Well, things like these are a little compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting tube of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was expected, the road started and we had not let our backpacks lie ahead, even if it was successful once, but it would have been harder to get back.
In addition, in these 40 minutes it seemed to wait for rain, so it came to the attempt to organize a riot of the people and attack the houses.
I think tomorrow will probably have a few 500 people lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip that I have received, I can already think that the output has been misprinted.
Of course, if I were to be asked about a perfect road, I would never be affected by that road.
So I think we'll still dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', held by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in Microsoft's case it is a route planner to move on the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, these "receptionists" can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, can hear it and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also organise the audiences according to the conversations in the groups.
In the presentation video "the receptionist" notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that conducts the conversation with her, and that she is also not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon be heard.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
I'm sure that's the future.
The company now has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computer was equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement when you think that Microsoft in Windows versions added some feature and `Extras'.
The Change of Direction Is Rewarded
Microsoft is right, the operating system loses its significance in a moderate way, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared online, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sended a lot of people point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his death, not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'window' environment.
What is the use of half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need it, no doubt. I'll give you a little example.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing drink automat is a sign affixed: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for online research.
By the way, last week, it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleus Marcel
Pablo Picasso held it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to count the countless stars performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a sharp bart that had raised weight in a walking circle.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, unarmed and tailed.
The Englishmen call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleus Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although she is called in the close circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name stands connected to sport and by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf, came from.
‘La Marcel’ excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with strips, babysitting, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very interesting.
I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate
Her great performance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is cute, but full of joy of life.
At present, the Gruz brothers take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, then moved her residence and also made the presentation of the most important awards in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Compassive and shy, winner on short tracks.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner with Valentino.
A very intense working time that is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I am fascinated by the cinema of the 1950s and the 1960s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything happens in one and these areas have many commonities.
Ever since I was a child, I have been thrilled by the dress; I have always wanted to go to my grandmother's touring my aunt's clothing and seeing her dress.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch out for the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and in the tests to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real role of performers.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and its professionality.
You've been 30 lately, haven't you been in a crisis?
Oh, yeah.
I feel better than I do when I'm 30.
I find that the woman will mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been doing since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time, I've known that I'm going to be a mother because that's what my body wants and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let it go.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will convey to my child great happiness and bring it up with great love.
With regard to film art, you keep in mind the work you took part in last year.
That is exactly what it is and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and anxious and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that ‘La last hour’ and ‘En search de la thumba de Christo’ will be listed for the first time.
See how you like them
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
If you're okay, don't say something like that.
It's not like I went up the stairs to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were raised to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, like the one who knows her, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handle, I'll do it too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is needed.
The drivers that can be delayed because of the alcohol level will need to install the 'alcohol'.
The authority arranges that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol abuse, installs in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunk state. If he is drunk, then the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced in June last month and is already part of the report of the Chief of State Attorney-General. According to her report, it is a pilot project that will take a year.
The aim is to re-socialise the driver, which is why he is given a course for re-introduction of traffic behaviour.
Apart from the General Public Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Vehicles will participate.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of drivers who were more than once exposed to alcohol influence were taxed again.
The ‘alcohol’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the air and prevents the auto-start when the driver has made an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than EUR 1,000, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of the infringements in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to engage in this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be carried out in the usual way, yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still not available on the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
In the morning, the House of Deputies will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., at the time scheduled for the program, next to the President of Benito Juárez de México DF Airport, the Spanish Air Force aircraft landed with the Duke and Prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair, which came out of the plane.
Directly at Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the princes of Asturias were visiting the city to formalise the official journey.
- Oh, very well, so you can't take people to the airport around this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Oh, that's good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who deliver the honoursalve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hair weighed by the wind, without normal 'peep-toes', may have been informed that there is a wet expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they laugh and are prepared for the photographers, where the official sequence awaits.
At the door of the hotel, where they are placed, one of the four largest in the city, there is a reporter waiting for her from the Mexican television that makes fun of her.
The best premium of the mode
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and probably there were no significantly excellent fashion designers and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Boton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashioners.
This is awarded at a cash price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the Mango branch window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and was almost crying because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest deal is in London.
So many events have happened that you want to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, got together. He drew the suit from the fashion house and caught some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a knight, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without Jackets, because Jackets borrowed the lady.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store and had a hat and shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of 'great pile'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice over the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always provokes a stormy excitement, and on Jon Travolta, who, after arriving (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, had asked in advance to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is not 1000, but one more option to forget a chaotic daily life.
And even if there are few, they are all collected in a book where there is a way to relax. The book comes into the book dealing on September 30.
The waker is a punishment when it sounds at 7:00 in the morning, but even worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that requires the current life.
The office is called the voltage and the computer that leads to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two ways to combat the daily exploitation and the problems of turning off the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga settings, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of options that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and thus the peace that the book conveys comes into the book dealing by the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as workplaces with the help of personal contacts, this handbook rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered as you stay in contact with nature or propose the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer elevated to restore balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to move on to the sofa, turn off the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talk in Sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened on the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be scared, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called sleep speech.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), on the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason why this appears.
Often relationships are sought with other appearances in sleep, such as alpine dreams, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (night's nights' nights' nights' nights' sleeps), words sought in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be on very high fibers, stress situations, or overload.
Anyway, it's a bit of a researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks in quiet words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (screams, wines, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and consulted by a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus comes to be.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated unless it is linked to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to reach the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them gain some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
If the speech occurs once in the sleep, try to keep the peace.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and on the next day it will be unable to remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, you will get it out of your sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it relaxes.
Think about it if it seems scary after a few appearances, it is recommended to consult or find out why the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (what is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an understanding and obtain more information.
So you won't be able to achieve anything because if the child sleeps, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That's causing a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long thirst strike, Illhouses on the playing field are finally back at a successful course.
Without great effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous torso chances and made it possible to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers had difficulty showing their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot is almost at the corner, Illuminated houses should easily dominate the game, and it was only possible to exchange fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a gun with a foot-tip to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with two Torchants first fought by Riahi and Temporal, and then with the first door for the Illhauser by Marais, who was right to accept again a ball that was rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the Illhouse Torschutz should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his teammates would have to continue playing.
However, Denmark did not know how to use this and did not face any major problems of an Illhaeusian Elve, which had just retreated a little to ‘defence’ their defense, except in the last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a great cross.
Sarkozy hits angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another stopover in Britain.
In view of the determined attitude of fishermen who blocked access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he would come with 'concrete suggestions'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee established by the British fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in this price, which has reached an average value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elyséepalast’s press spokesman David Martinon, the president will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies to become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of seamen’.
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led in the Morbihan and Calvados protests that caused the stasis almost ten kilometers long.
The harbour of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The peninsula of Quiberon was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors express their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and of the canal, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen do not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the boats' manoeuvres.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockage of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', for 'the fishermen will not be allowed to go anywhere' and 'will not go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient, announced.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 following the consequences of cancers in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also agreed to the playwright and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer estimates 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, has its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, President Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer looks forward to much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of size from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times' Sunday issue, the American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were allocated to it.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and age insurance in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained with the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG could possibly separate from are its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the back-insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and its investments in the private equity, FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG needs to make sales as soon as possible in order to repay the loans over 85 billion that it has granted to the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will lose the same amount.
Analysis Historic Paris meeting Historic morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic case of the courses on Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of approximately 800 points, and on Saturday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is reduced by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded before 17 September 2001, the date of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final estimate, the Nasdag index, mainly in terms of technology, decreased by 199,61 points to 1,983,73, and the widely distributed Standard&Poors index 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which should once again allow for some stability in the markets, the Wall Street, which was already hit at the beginning of the quarter, broke down.
With 228 votes against and 205 votes against, the Members rejected the funds that he had prayed for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
‘Here is a bad picture that makes the Congress incapable of adopting a plan,’ said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
This shows how much the market was counting on this plan', added it, and fears that a project "too late" will come over in several days.
‘If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Amm. d. Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis in the grip, which would limit the credit conditions even more’, Brian Bethune, head of business at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed that she stressed the feeling of extreme urgency even more, that every day she spends the ruin of a financial company 'in the United States 'with her.
After the Washington Mutual competition on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy the bank shops of Wachovia through its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets were facing not only an American but a global crisis', the analyst of the FTN added Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown considerably.
The revenue of the State Fund has fallen from 3,632% on Friday evening to 3,827% on Friday evening, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4,161% to 4,357% on Friday evening.
Obama, winner by points in the first television show
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday followed another to find out who the winner was, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory over both Republicans and Democrats in this television show, which should be followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite visible, was not brilliant enough to enable him to stop his decline in election questions five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to Obama with five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat makes the better figure.
In the case of the still undecided voters, that is, those to which it now comes, Obama emerged with 39% as the winner of the polls, while according to a CBS survey 25% of them McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the good performance expected by his rival Joseph Biden during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts', but this weekend Bill Clinton warned.
McCain did not give up his unquestionable experience in the field of foreign policy, and in this way clearly underline the 'Naivity' of his opponent regarding these issues that were the focus of this first television show.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to become President," he also assured.
An attack that has been spread since yesterday in the Republican polls.
Obama himself emphasized that he represents the future.
He made a brief and precise statement without being taken out.
He put his ability into the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
‘McCain has still not understood Obama already’, opposed this weekend a democratic election campaign in which the Republican was proposed not to have fully understood the extent of the crisis on which the ‘Americans from the street’ were charged.
During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama called on 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in torrential rains on the occasion of an election in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words ‘middle stand’ or ‘worker’. ‘The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the bottom, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a crucial turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final part of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After stressing again that he would perhaps even create a reduction in taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was of the highest priority for him.
McCain, however, wanted to build an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates raise the questions raised on the plan to save the financial market of more than 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted yesterday evening by the Congress and is extremely unpopular to the people.
Have you noticed that there was a choice in Minsk?'
Youth and opposition demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white Russians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the lobby in Minsk market to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukashenko's power: 'The dictator should retreat'.
Some admit that they didn't even choose: ‘What will it do if they do what they want with my voice,’ says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has been shown to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-participation of Visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the disposal of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census', said Juri Potemkin, a press speaker of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous combination of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, says Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If the opposition Members join Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore guilty of joining the political game because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protector of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that the electoral participation rates were too high and that the extension of the vote fee in advance (26%) of Minsk voters had paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
‘Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?’ asks the leader of Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released this August.
There was no one in the lobby.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most in line with the ideas of the government.
The silence of the night goes down again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Undermining - From blood that was safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her establishment, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec became one of the world's safest and most efficient blood banks.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which has been severely shaken by the scandal of the infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross were infected during the 1980s with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to draw up directives to prevent a new catastrophe of this kind.
While Richter Krever was still reluctant to submit his report, several provinces then set up a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for the administration of blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through the work in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before she proudly stressed that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains in his awareness that “trust is extremely fragile”.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine disease in Europe with a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the founding of 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we looked at one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which, according to one, apply exclusion measures, if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as it is obviously with the Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease of the case, which is expressed by degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease would be transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has absolutely no meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technology for HIV detection appeared on the market: the NST tests that allow the donor to directly detect the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the previously used test.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
So the risk of certain donors being infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements enabled the risk of transmission of AIDS via a blood transfusion to a significant extent.
Today, one out of 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood cans should be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV was transmitted via a blood can.
I think that today you can feel good when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe to restore health," says Hema-Quebec's head of management.
Our challenge for the next ten years is to keep our products safe.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year on the island of Réunion was the Chikungunya virus that, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects via blood.
We need to monitor continuously," Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
The need is rising because the population is ageing.
As cancer treatment is more aggressive, patients often require new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood-spending network, which on average accounts for only 3% of the population eligible for blood-spending Quebec.
Every healthy person who is 18 years old or older and meets the eligibility criteria can contribute blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who make their blood available are not accepted because they are infected with AIDS or malaria for example, and those who are travelling to a country where malaria is spread are excluded for one year from blood donation.
With this 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and no more blood can be donated.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep it and to make it regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation," laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyelids and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public nail blood bank Quebec.
In the nail chain that was previously considered biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood on stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth Nabel blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
‘We should probably start at the beginning of next year to make it available for transplants’, explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and cost-effective program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinal
Montreals Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all the doors) against the Sounders from Seattle at the second and decisive game of the fourth final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the total score ratio is qualified for the semi-final round of the final games of the first USL league.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the crucial door in the ninth minute of the game.
After a first half without a gate for both the one side and the other side, the middle-field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the formation of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way of the Sounders.
We remember that in the first game of the front-and-back series on Friday, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1 defeat in a Seattle suburb.
In the semi-final, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in the back of Minnesota through a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps entered the semi-final round with a total tor ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - victory star by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostistsyn launched the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Costitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a door, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this game, the fourth of the tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only door of the whole shooting.
I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel better.'
"He's fixed himself too much in the first half of the day," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got a storm attack.
Charest is set on the north
The Prime Minister does not refuse to open elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general meeting of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest arrived yesterday after Jean-Tallon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (Linke) tried to be elected in today's elections.
`Move the course of our last great border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the general meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, which followed all the guidelines.
During his talk, a kind of painting mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of hydropower plants, mining plants, viewed by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the election period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his timetable was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although she has been mentioned many times in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the north was `a jewel with enormous potential', but did not call a date, no investment amounts or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the top of some views on what could be done more: above all on water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, benefited by the growth of the emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to the census, Mr. Charests owns the north `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as big as France' is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is in us', he stressed how to show clearly that he is looking for a national founding dream to come true.
Quebec is very grown by its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitib, the technique Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after putting in a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a line where there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity is offered, I will take this attitude back on behalf of the government," he explained.
In addition, ‘with the climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north’, he explained and spoke about the northwest Passage, which will be sustainable due to the melting of ice all year round.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about dealing with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani Member of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelleter, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land estimates) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'a common vision' will be created.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be ‘talked, regulated and environmentally friendly’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was before him in the office.
Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have thought about turning the challenges into new growth and development change.
This was, moreover, one of the ever-rejected themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of taking over the party.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
'From Godbout, who created the Hydro-Quebec, about the reading that reached the quiet revolution and the state of water electricity, to Burrassa, who made the James book, our party always knew how to determine the future,' said Jean Charest.
The press referred to another conservative project this time, namely the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project water staudam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest, which was planned to launch in 2012.
'That remains among us, but I have to be at it,' he confided in his party members, which resulted in the crash.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and of course also in 2009, has in fact not yet been excluded from this autumn's election, which is possible under the law.
He stressed, however, that his timetable is complete, especially because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general meeting of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially those adopted without further consideration by the Constitution: the PLQ specifically calls for the recognition of the particularity of Quebecs in the Constitution.
She would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Radio and Television, and to have a vote on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were included with skepticism.
The leader of the Québec Party, Pauline Marois, has again highlighted the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the liberal government refused to apply them.
If she had done so, ‘we are going a lot further today’, Ms. Marois decided on the side of her candidate in Jean-Tallon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a plan north by the government.
'But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - An enchanted country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (which irony) at Harper's cabinet, it was the last summer he allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a ‘sland’ for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration, is so funny to cover up, she says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do with a government here that, as the only one in all the countries concerned, has not brought their countryman trapped in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider Omar Khadr to be even more young than the things that have happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a fair parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
We remind ourselves that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are working to get Omar Khadr home to get him a fair trial in Canada.
Exactly this government also closes its eyes to torture: it is little interest to her that a young adult after so many years of qual will certainly be broken mentally forever.
We are not aware of it yet, but here we are experiencing a homicidal cutting-off of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly wearing as a flag, and that from his mouth sounds as unsaid.
So the time has come when there is no morale anymore: a Canadian citizen may be deliberately abused, tortured and imprisoned, according to the well-being of a government chief who is only supported by the minority (maybe he belongs to the minority after 14 October...).
Many electors believe that they will find their salvation with a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has given itself away from what was called the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this dissatisfaction, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellish speech of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devor published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwelling logic, that the world's largest gold mining company has tried to open up an insulting complaint of over six million against three authors and a small unmediated publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slanderous complaints, but in the law.
This fundamental difference is expected to be completely obscured by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruins, who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
As far as the process is concerned, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare for their defense and fight a very unequal army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexplicable pockets of goldmine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are often used to ruin the defenders in order to force an comprehensible regime that causes the opposite side to die and also scares anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, she would have to present her views to the public.
In contrast to what is going on and on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, debates are usually carried out in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through the height of buttons.
It would have been enough, therefore, if the Goldmine had revealed its books and documents and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support Noir Canada's authors with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could at the same time ask for a 'public' debate and yet reject the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world includes only the generous lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very well-closed view of the concept.
In a democracy, even ridiculers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many believe to be a 'knebel' cry (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a request to the Noir Canada authors, in which they ask them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
She completely denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by Noir Canada's authors.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong knows for a long time to get debate and disagreements in the grip and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that she, in contrast to what she is proposing, does not want to have a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that limit this type of unfair complaint.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
At the same time, the Bush administration and the leading congressional, republican and democratic deputies came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis, which has been threatening Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main content is: a better control of the Members of Parliament on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to prevent the number of houses due to payment balances, as well as the right to monitor the fees paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
US Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans present at the negotiations announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market', said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis at Wall Street," said the Democrat.
This is the basic point: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest will be enormous in the daily life of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that would have had a new failure on investors' mood.
The deadline agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates who were only late in the negotiations showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addendum of certain provisions for agreeing, especially those which should enable owners to keep their houses and those which concern the holders of the senior employees of the state-saved company.
‘If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of certain persons, this is not something you might wish to be pleased with.
But these measures are necessary', he said on American television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
The guidelines I have read, [show] that this is a thing that we all need to digest, and with which we can get ahead.
The option, even nothing to do, is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is directed towards the money of taxpayers
He comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the location of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of expanded loans (PCAA), and finally in a freeze of financial power and in the ruins of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican Members failed to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of companies in distress are only to be secured by the government and not to be bought, it is believed that the bag gas has escaped.
In order to round up the perspectives for all at the Congress, a provision has also been added that if the government should lose this programme within five years, it could raise new taxes to retain the capital it used.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which the next 100 billion can be added if the President sees it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a new vote by the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that bring him in the case of dividends and that can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to suspend the winding-up procedures in respect of the apartments which are linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to set deadlines for the repayment and settlement of the claims paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, she is still not sure that her plan will get green light.
In fact, more votes were taken yesterday against this project, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Unfortunately Washington doesn't understand us,' said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that exists to ask the taxpayers to cash.'
The democratic Member Brad Sherman, leader of a group at the Congress called 'the Caucus of Skeptics', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written us to inform us: we ask the Congress not to be put under pressure and to think carefully about which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we again received in Europe evidence that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial settlement of the Fortis Banking Group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion dollars).
The entry of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refuse to buy their competitors, which is in great difficulty, since it has lost 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis through the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, declared yesterday by Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we have a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.'
During this time, the British government was on the other side of the arm's length channel just to make another bank in need of a financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans to Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government has to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent have kept him from a position of power that brings truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a long-lasting one!
On Friday, at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer on his run in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he had been a sort of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his performance, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of the freedom and explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-speaking mother.
Its European roots should be one of the spacious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, excellent quality.
Because in him was a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was injured in the fight in the Pacific War, who studied art in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Mans Second in 1979 at the 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a preview relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
It also disappears the unknown aspects of this mysterious, retaining, committed and sensitive star against the glamour of the show business, whose puzzle will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the cinema lovers this weekend to Tamil, while on the dark screen of memories were played all his great roles.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
Then again the charming Cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) moves back to memory, and the young man who returned his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to the cat on the hot roof filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter reminder (1990) will be called to watch over his sensitive Mr Bridge, who is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises at his high age.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Hand Full of Shit) by Robert Wise, a role that James Dean had thought of, was re-enacted after his death and made Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove was awarded in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), 1973 with the Oscar for the best film.
As a biting and thoughtful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face passed through the times, that was it.
He's still here.
In his course of life, epochs unite.
The youth knows him primarily from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of Brother Coen in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as the path of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several filmmakers who have retired early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the satellite for a long time and betray Hollywood, his assets, his princes and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the `underplaying', when he assessed his all too expressive performance.
The Meteor was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whom the roles only flew for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fissels or doubters, with whose perfect representation he reflected his dissipation and his impalement.
As director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true subtle sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the lead role, painted a fine portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, devoted this 1984 his film to Harry and Son, a work full of feigning feelings and sadness.
On the flow of honors that came yesterday about Newman ergoss, his close friend and former armed companions Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said extremely: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, he is now also a major prosecutor of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the Hollywood branch, there.
We may have seen him with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, meals or other foods, and this was considered quite tasteless, although we still found it fun at first.
However, the profits from its turnover flow into its foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
A exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and wideest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of supplement &amp; Co.?
On 8 October the negotiations in the criminal process began against János and his accomplices.
In particular, the accused is accused of participating in organised crime, as well as serious accidental damage and fraud, and other criminal acts - including document fraud.
According to the Public Prosecutor, the funds resulting from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often recorded with false accounts.
State funds and grants from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly poured into the funds of the organization Fiatal Balldal, partly into individual private funds.
As the investigating authorities have announced, fictitious accounts have been submitted in relation to the tendering fees and the associations should also not comply with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the accounts were to be falsified.
The invoice blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunahalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that tour north of the lake, on which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploratory tour", Lados should discover pensions and restaurants.
He requested bills on consumption in order to be able to issue, later on, accounts based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-management of Budapest.
These accounts should have been manipulated mostly by István Lados and his complicit, András 周ri, who should have been responsible for the drafting of the reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Experience Tour" was a beer resort.
As two of the accounts issued in 2003 are to be taken into account by the gastronomy company, the nineties-percentage group of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company says that a large group of these would not have even fit into the room.
Another bill, published in the summer of 2002, to the Job Jöv ́ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évèvredért, also showed serious shape and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and is not able to accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are expected to stay.
The fantasy of the accountants was apparently not set limits when it came to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in whose bookkeeping Customer Documents Job Jöv ́ért and Hoppá were not even published by the Prosecutor's Office.
As Managing Director Gy Whoa! Farkas of hvg.hu reported, he was immediately aware that it was false documents when documents were submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor during an inquiry.
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp".
And further: Apart from forms errors, the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated hundreds of people after having a total of eleven rooms that could not be accommodated by so many people.
The restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The Emsy Accountants have also failed to check that the Budapest Travel Office that they took as their visa offers exclusively travel abroad, and thus have indicated Hungarian travels on the payment account, which is also contrary to the company's accounting practice.
As was known in the course of the investigations, they also included VAT on VAT, although travel services which relate to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The value added tax amounted to four of the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jöv ́ért wrong, as the operation is calculated instead of only 25 per cent VAT, and only machine bills are issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error that had occurred to the "accountants" was that they had indicated in one case "goods transport" as the performance given, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the public prosecutor informed.
Other forms of error - false accounting format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be discolored as falsifications.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managers claimed that the bills had never been issued.
Another "error" is the falsifiers at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was just in the process of resolving (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület had eaten there - the mass administrator therefore claimed that the bills had not been issued by themselves.
Consciously false
The other group of accountants are persons who were quite aware that they had to lay fictitious accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták, the Esély Budapest Alapítvány Foundation has issued accounts for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to display the fictitious accounts.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation, is also intended to work together with additional and co.: In 2003, the GmbH will have provided the Jobb JövÕért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyˈ Egyesület Associations with false accounts of the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unsolicited services.
However, there were also few payments since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but those involved in their documents had forgotten to mention.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly brought into contact with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of the Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not located there.
This company will have issued several invoices for the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF around 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is expected to be the buyer of these accounts.
The manager of this company was a Romanian who should also be supplied with the company documents by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has stood during the investigations, issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Atlasz and Hoppá Associations, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have cancelled their own equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian maurers on Iván Kubatov's express desire.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which the defendant said was due to lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the company: At the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned with the preparation of the company's supporting documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the associations that were associated with the grant, such as Atlasz and Y-Generació.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 accounts for the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The public prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have paid 10% of the total and VAT.
Kubatov should even have abused Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious bills - in this case the bills were supported by the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the Socialist Party's non-profit organization, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints, but these amounts were used abroad.
To cover this, they presented the TMA with five fictitious calculations of the Works Team Kft.
These accounts were also secured during the examination of the Office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, a number of accused persons are now charged with an opinion on the conduct of fraud, as they have already been brought before the public prosecutor.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, János, decided on a comprehensive statement.
His details had been less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his statement still stands out.
The question therefore remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the repayment of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a grant is willing to accept responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that the appeal now plays the "complicated" after his search for relief of the arrest and house arrest on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have suffered far greater harm with economic offences and have not paid them, are free on foot, or are at least under house arrest, the possibility remains to be denied.
The psychology of the area - or why we are willing to pay more
In case of auctions, the buyers tend to issue more and thus overestimate the error bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as a auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to earn money, however, an increased activity of the stress, a complex below the brain, in the loss of the auction, in which the opponent's overrun played an important role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase was explained by avoiding an overreaction of the street.
In order to undermine their theses, the economists in the research group have also employed investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should be offered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they came out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis on which one was on the gain, while the other on the loss.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the group playing against losing were prepared to make higher efforts than those in the control group or the "win group".
"These results cannot be attributed to any previous economic theory.
These are the behaviours observed in auctions so far only based on the joy of winning, or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories has been solved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we have now prepared a third statement" - said Andrew Scotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death.
However, the number of infected is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which means that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various infectious liver diseases.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but errors and diseases differ.
Depending on the breeder, the hepatitis virus is spread in two different types: hepatitis A and E by digestion (e.g. by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, secretion or storage).
Travellers are recommended for vaccination against viruses A and B, however, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Then the yellowing occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine is dark, and the healing can take up to two or three weeks.
Around the world, about 1 million people die annually from hepatitis B-related, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only every 10 infected people are treated with medication.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: it may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the bug destroys the liver cells in a home - in many cases the first symptoms are shown after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more often: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
At present, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In due course, the disease is healthy, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
On September 30, the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 is the first time of patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of the chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious belief like a kind of "smear" has already been shown to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It was examined how much faith in God affects people's feelings of pain, the British magazine "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, every 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks while they studied a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project involving philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University.
In the attempt, the subjects were connected to the left hand, which the electroshocks gave up.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: To one image of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vinci "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would trigger a kind of religious trance, while they chose da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and was found to be reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and received 20 electric shocks in four stages at this time, while they should either see the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" at the sight of God's mother, as if they were "anxious" and had felt "peace and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thought that similar effects could also be caused by other, powerful images also with the atheists, but they had to find the appropriate photo.
"We had to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it should also do so in many cases," Wright said.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains which effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality young woman Maria achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling me about yourself.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is in people's pockets as well as over their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, which doctors they go to, and what they move.
And that's still not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managers.
In the direction of Skeptics, which are predicted by Orwell's Horror Visions, he points out: These would just ignore the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently thought that Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company’s original goal, where they want to “order all the information of this world”.
Schmidt explained that after ten years of changing work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status Quo in five years meant Schmidt: he wished Google would be able to ask questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" to answer, however, software programs are not yet able because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be recorded during their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the sites visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and then take back to it so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic the so-called "recommendations" are also based on which the system recommends tailored products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the case of data abuse - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that affects fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire for power that is opposed by many internet users.
However, it is clear that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties, and there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user in these cases.
A parade example of this was the action against paedophile in Brazil recently, in the course of which Google provided information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the paedophiles.
However, for personal rights, users who were concerned were still able to breathe up when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, went successfully against the FBI before the court: therefore, in the future, Google can not be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully published 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms in relation to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been re-scheduled to the list of individual users, i.e. their web and search terms for two months.)
Google’s image thus remains controversial: Those who publish their personal data in Hungary because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google’s services, the company gives the company the feeling that the companies that are conservatively representing themselves are paying.
Indes sees the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and excited computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason is that Google does not require identification codes against Microsoft, and its services provide free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be much more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are reviewing the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been brought to the centre in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is nothing but collaboration, talk, leave the users deliberately tracking and using the available communication channels, and even if the amounts are different individually, the main thing remains to be seen, that is to say, public.
At the same time, an average young person can manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are hosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When considering the party photos of the last night, the friend soon finds out who she has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released because in his blog he is only making all too much of his anger about the company's conduct - one is sure: The term "private" has now been reinterpreted completely.
If you lead an online life, this is what he prizes from himself - so in example you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even run the Google Monopol, can do it gladly - like with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, does not intentionally leave any traces.
Not only do few people intentionally register on community pages so that they are not available, but also Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
The public opinion waits for the ban until Google shows her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the faster and faster introduced services provide not only Microsoft, but also other software developers break heads.
However, critical observers also find the disturbing counter-polyes: For example, the Group Management has rejected a protest of the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and management thought that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive. However, it is quite encouraging that in 2006 Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that would filter out all the regimeal critical hits, or those who violated the good taste.
The Group's internal rules state that no new service will be sought in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years might be a little overcrowded again: While some of my Google's book and magazinescan or archiving projects are currently taking up to the extent that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are more concerned about the health system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already provides the next generation of Sci-Fi authors with the material - like "Scrooglid", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes in a better orwelling way a future in which a person will be very close to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of ozd in the elimination of the trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police now interviewed two young people who were suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, the spokesperson of the Borsod police station told them on Tuesday.
The young people were constant, currently being accused of aid.
According to information provided by the news agency MTI, these are two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened by a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was investigated on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people from money.
In the course of the investigations, it has been shown that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to cover his debts, so on Wednesday he lured his believer into an area in Ozd, where he murdered him and his nine - year - old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden in the tent.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the actual weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Börse places a purchase order for Prague Börse
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the hundred percent purchase of the shares package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, however, which wants to sell more than 60% of the paper in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", Poland's bids include the highest purchase price offered to the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week, said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owners of all stakeholders, and he also did not conclude that it could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange on 5-10 billion crowns.
Under the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In her comments devoted to the ongoing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves already spoke on Tuesday from "the second 11 September".
We have to thank the US President for the global financial disaster, for example "La Repubblica" - the President has not even been able to get his own party for the bill behind him to bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-thousand investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid are also located in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The U.S. financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and it will cause suffering to the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the congress vote, there is a threat that Washington has not prepared a political means of crisis management.
The world economy depends on the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva "day-advertising".
Although some states could provide their money institutions with rescue packages and save banks with taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there is no need for more banks to argue, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU Member States had to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weak financial institutions, the Viennan "The Standard" recalls. Furthermore, as the newspaper continues, concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would have to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not taken the crisis seriously, which now rages like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "saviour" did not have to "weave" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be wise to establish in which case it would be reasonable to seize the taxpayer's money to avoid even greater damage.
Smart car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if we did not imitate the obstacles sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired to create new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic system operated by autobots of the type BR23C, a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bees, which can see in every direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers come up with the idea of laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180-degree field within 2 metres, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in seconds breaks, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manoeuvre is purely instinctive.
"If not, the autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the most internal and vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is still considered inevitable within the accident.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they deviate from other bees.
And that has to go on in the fraction of a second.
However, the deviation, unlike the bees, can not go up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of tyre susceptibility.
While the bees are infinitely open here to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the movement of the autobot, or acceleration and suspension.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device must only process some inputs per second and react accordingly.
It does not have to store these, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous maneuvers, so that it is currently only a handful KB Memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of severe memory.
This is the first step in developing the immediate collision prevention technology, which will be serially in production within the next ten years, according to Nissan's assessment.
Another application could find technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately driving the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the 700-billion-dollar heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aims at the purchase of the banks' bad loans.
In the first step, half of the money will be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight on the eastern coast, after several days of debate, the Congressional Members reached an agreement on the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House of Deputies, and thought that the agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said that the program will be effective and it will be effective, but more has to be done. According to Pelosi, it was not about saving the Wall Street, but about the rudder of the economy.
The package's written version was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Washington Time Sunday at 8 a.m. (Middle European Time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger an altitude flight on the stock exchange.
On Monday, the House of Deputies will first vote on the draft legislation for the stabilization of the economy in 2008, then the Senate will be in line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration, which would result in the spending of $700 billion once for the purchase of counterfeiter, with credit-charged securities.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum is to be spent on buying credit-ridden, bad securities and the next 100 billion USD is to be decided by the President.
The programme shall be reviewed by a separate Commission, which shall also be owned by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
Within the meaning of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined approach: it can also buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgaged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law enables the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the care-giving resources and the companies pay the fees due for the damage to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as immediate aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks involved in difficulties and now state aid can count on the government to shorten their disposals, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
A reduction in the fees will only exist in certain cases and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists each.
The reduction basically means that if the ministry buys in an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the senior bank manager is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the fake credit, the government will aggressively activate itself to ensure that the managers are not overrun.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more and more people are involved in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in manager fees are regulated by law, the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State acquires participation rights in participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank get better.
The bill stipulates that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect the taxpayer's money at all, says the Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were led by the same people who are also responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

No more visas in the United States since 2009?
Kinga Göncz is looking forward to the entry into force of the US-Hungarian visa agreement on 12 January, as stated by the Foreign Minister before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Your view is that "all matters now depend only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced into the overseas environment in a timely manner."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists had to register in advance.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets with Foreign Minister Condolezza Rice, who will transmit the "Middle Cross with Stars" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conducts talks with the foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the $700 billion hard rescue package for banks. However, there are also politicians who call for the Minister of Finance's resignation.
The Congress and representatives of the government announced on Sunday after long marathon talks that they had reached an agreement on the Bank's rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the rise of the frozen credit market, have become the main issues of the Presidency's campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claimed to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its advancement thanks to the economic issues, while McCains Hoch, who had secured him the presentation of Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was also involved.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion dollar heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection which he has supported.
"We need to act now, but responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industrial branches, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic vision "an obsolete".
In an interview given by the sender ABC, McCain said: "We will all be hard to find (...) but there is certainly no alternative".
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a supervisory commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the disposals for the top manager - something he has been on.
The CBS said Obama, McCain would not have played a definitive role in the negotiations, however he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right warehouse is intact, the only voters within the camp became self-conscious - thus "Der Spiegel" comments the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "The Bavarian Revolution desecrates its fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the Erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christians have renewed Bavarian over decades - right now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the epoch is a problem of Christ's democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
Not surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which had already been recorded quite exactly ten years ago: the unmistakable hegemony of a state party
Because ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the 1950s under the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Federal Elections, which is still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization carried out by the CSU in the federal state has ultimately ruined its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the time it was very high. However, without any impact, secularization, educational success, the closure of East and North Germans in the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain faithful to the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right warehouse is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willed.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic groups of citizens expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the professional citizenship and voters with Abiur as a university graduate.
Here the support of the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in its "Who with? Party leaders holding on to coalition issues" articles on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the EVP.
The EPO prohibits the involvement of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ shows itself open in all directions for talks, while the Greens do not yet want to determine a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is going around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the parties were barely looking at their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very likely - in some federal countries and in the social partnership - this is already the case.
The question of whether he could present himself to a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current CEO of the EEVP as vice-cancer, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the Schüssel-Mutterer course.
There is no question of repeating this direction.
Manyer has responded carefully to red offers.
Co-operation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann tried to involve himself in the internal affairs of the EVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or going to the coalition, is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed up in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to take over government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is being set up by the EU Presidency of France today.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, in particular the Education Segregation, drew attention to the fact that it is one of the most serious violations of the law that the Roma children are resisting, and this is the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz reported, Járóka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, the Roma would be forced primarily because of their low level of education from the labour market.
"The vast majority of Roma-young people have no secondary education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka further stressed that education is a fundamental human right, a key role that comes with the application of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
It is important, in the view of the honourable Members, that this relationship should become as wide a circle as possible - that is, Rome and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the stronger his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and income tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Rome must be guaranteed the right to high quality education - the poor and segregated teaching must be stopped," says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member explained, a common, objective and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly complied with.
"We must break the devil's circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit will be held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum to advance the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national, levels within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Mercy on time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the electoral cycle, there are still no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personal debates were postponed.
Mr Huber and Mr Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is how long this grace is worth.
On the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice on the last October weekend, the extraordinary party will be decided.
However, the much dressed duo has already shown that it does not want to stick on their seats.
This is why they want to address the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Bayeric tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent. Now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was a 46-year-old "alleingüierer" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the decisive force in which the Hungarian economy is also important for the southern federal economy, but they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructurings, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team, which will conduct a poll on a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free voters".
One irony of fate is that with the list of "Free voters" that Gabriele Pauli enters the Legislature, whose anti-stoymen appeared the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to serve the goalful politician unhappily.
The CSU management now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far taken the threads out of the background, will become an active role. On 28 September, the former Prime Minister and CSU president called the "bistest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - in his view the CSU deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to its success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its legs with a common force, Merkel cannot be a chancellor again after the September 2009 Federal Day elections.
Merkel, who has not made a cure for the failure of the Fiasko, believes that the land loss of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the injured CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats is going on.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0
In the Sunday elections, it did not create an opposition MP in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies in the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD is suspected of illegality in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of the 10 million resident state has been unopposed for decades, it has seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who was the fourth member of the presidency to "let some members of the opposition in Parliament" will be "renewed" for the fourth time by a constitutional change.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the boyskotten previously planned.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia's increasing prices for natural gas imports. Even credit has been raised for the reduction of price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the opposition's expectations, the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU was therefore to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians have been banned as a result of the EU's anti-democratic political system.
For temporary relaxation, the OECD evaluation report focused on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign already on Monday - therefore opposition should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition is able to recognise an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free footing, and Minsk is even willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the devolved Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, has been considered independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the main thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, even though "the powerful have been afraid to leave only one opposition to Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for economic reform.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of the sale of stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even older ones," said Milinkewitsch, assuming that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukaschenko regime, the only merit of which is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that begins to break at the quiet of a cemetery," said Milinkewitsch.
Unlike the opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in acts, not words." The lack of opposition was therefore evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those sluices which will only stamp and then go to coffee drinks during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Relevant doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," points out Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi refers to this: "the choice of the rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General said: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all there is now no breakfast during working time; close with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas said in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Superior Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Administrazione)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, which means 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"their wage dynamics - as the Minister has said - have been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined in opposing the Brunetta Decree as part of the Codacons-supported appeal.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with figures about lower abstentions at work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulpelze' grow continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to declare war against the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases; the planned extension of the mandatory household remains of the sick worker, during which checks can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2500 accidents occurred in Italy, three people died, and 27 remain alive disabled.
For 2007, the data from Inaill (Istituto nationale contra gli inforturuni sul trabajo) confirm that the fatal occupational accidents were around 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that almost doubles the number of deaths caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take place in all Italian provinces on the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione Nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del trabajo) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and the raising of public awareness".
"A touching "Basta" has emerged from this; of course, in tragedy that, measured in its magnitude, triggers some cubes in the media and public participation. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even happen in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case also a resource problem: there must be a crucial investment in education and information."
The numerous initiatives to raise direct awareness in school frameworks are of particular importance for young people who are growing up in the workplace.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to deviate from its social seriousness. We need to put in place and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths is an urgent social emergency, which affects the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on certain rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not mean that the number of occupational deaths is too high," says President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That is exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"We believe that you are basically too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
Stronger controls and inspections are, in our opinion, necessary – says Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to clarify workers who are already beginning in school."
"An additional effort is needed - as he adds - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is asked about a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also came to speak of "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and urged "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employee a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident of work does not depend on voluntary or incidental donations that are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player in charge: Hazard of hearing damage
Listening to music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports on the EU's opinion of the Csseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) in a report published in Brussels today.
"It is clear from the report, as one notes, that 5-10% of those who spend at least five years a week listening to music with portable music devices for at least one hour a day risking their hearing loss."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually wear music and mobiles put on a high volume, their hearings without knowing it irreversibly damage," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – as it is called since the eu – there is a clear risk of rapid action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information community.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine existing control systems in order to be fully effective and to keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"Scientists - thus the EU Communication - confirm that you are too concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other members of the EU and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music and similar devices."
There is already a European norm that limits the sound level of portable music devices to 100 dB at the moment.
These damage can be very limited, which involves solutions such as reducing volume and length of noise loss.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu points out that when users of portable music devices hear music only five hours a week (up to 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This means 5-10% of users of such devices whose number can be estimated between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Germany gives the launch committee on the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it's supposed to be by the end of March. In June, the balance sheet will be drawn.
This is the outcome of the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" set by the Chapter. This morning the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla terms.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the city and municipality will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," stressed Germanyno. "It will work on proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders of the city and municipality remain.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve again, as such a project must have a temporary end point.
In June - as the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission".
Those who question the Commission's competence because their opinion is lacking in commitment, Germany points out: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
It is too often that politics deals with the daily problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period of time in view, so that we can work with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The mayor of Rome values the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to mind. It will occupy the best heads of the capital".
According to Germanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan which is neither hermetical nor static to enable a quality leap - which it really needs - in order to take a joint step towards the future".
A future, says the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only restrict themselves to the current municipal borders but will continue to look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much concerned with being seen as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will become the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, descimated the US economy and maintained relations with the found Islam (and still does this as a private man)".
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more intense, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very shy: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen in total two black governors and five black senators!".
However, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the surveys; everyone says that Obama will be won with a great lead.
In this case too, people are there who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the electoral booth will we know who the true American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which has been kept hidden until last.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide for whom we'll make our hooks, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – just now, where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush have during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step in the back.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
One who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark even among journalists: the newspapers can already feel the cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "murder" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express their concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the competent authorities.
They don't feel as lonely as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, that is, the room where the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism is meeting the American journalist today.
Six of the ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, there are even 65% of the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine how the web is going.
The main publishing groups are on the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping that "they will do something good for journalism".
The largest riss exists in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the chief editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who fear losing their work within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists there are 30%.
The theme of "safer work" in the team (our "editors", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current theme in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, such as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, the employers offer them as they like and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editors receive very often very high wages, and the editor, however, can sometimes receive only EUR 10000 per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, as well as so many after the third, to finally reach a certain number of years of 15 holidays.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often be "sick" during the year.
It's a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: RIGHT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA LIMITED IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinadu, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him last week, his release from house arrest was turned into a duty of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate maker to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, such proceedings (which the public prosecutor had expressed) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans were and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than the economy.
This confirms the strict edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the run-up to the Republican Party is becoming increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives that are hostile to "this in Washington" and the financial world and, for example, win in the south and the centre of the states voters.
This part of the party thanks its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example is not only a small part of the major changes that announce or even represent the current economic crisis: not only in the USA, but also in the whole of the West, but perhaps beyond that will be affected by them.
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the discovery, the uninterrupted renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions that have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an unfavourable amount of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which are also an enormous number of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically against it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone away and lost its right of speech: the illuminating evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its second division in various national and international conflicts, does not find a common way.
Therefore, everyone is counting on the intervention of his own country; rescue plans, new rules, and so on. Distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States in the economic situation can save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two non-overestimable conditions – under certain circumstances – which otherwise may not be able to recover from an international organisation or market in a similar manner.
A new emphasis on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that is recently linked in the economy to a more closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxist way is right now, when we were so convinced that we would have entered a networked whole for a long time, into a kingdom of ever-differentiated technologies, of immaterial that we need to know once again how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, grain and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still highly linked to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a land free of landfill, water-free or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, but it is a brief one.
Who's a territory, who's a government, who says politics, that's what leadership says.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of equipment on existing pipelines, such as those of the economy, which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper richer and in some sense even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an invulnerability, an image of inhospitability, a feeling of distance that is all about a whole class of Western managers.
It seems thus to be the belief among many parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their idea world, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as ever more and more prevalent.
The demand for leadership is thus fueled by a weakened but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This is manifested in the unforeseeable "revolving" of the voters and in the unmistakable conversion of the collective mood of the last time: beginning with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of the US MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role here).
You get the impression that the old elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, magazines, intellectual creditors, some of them would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value in what is going on today in the lower social layers of the West and strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be excessive to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes wide open is not for sure.
The super hangman that lets the walls up
The forces of gravity can be overcome by a adhesive and can climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four U.S. research centres, one of which seems almost to be reaching the goal.
With a sticker of only 2.5 qcm mounted on an area, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – has an American magazine, published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material produced by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which uses a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the sticker can be seen as a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been able to inspire themselves with the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic resins that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the ability to keep the feet of the Reptilians and at the same time "lets away without problems from the wall", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
AN MAUERN ENGLISH? "This material could be used as a traditional adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Like Spiderman on walls? Maybe already, but researchers are thinking of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also leaders of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the area of space travel.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, dedicates itself to a new kind of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a microfibre adhesive that cleans itself from dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always preserves a perfect liability.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription
Caution against grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness in the summer, can cause serious health damage when taken simultaneously with certain vital medicines, as they may have an extreme effect on the absorption of them by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit products in connection with drug intake. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again sounded an alarm: there is enough glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines so that they are practically eliminated and the health of patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmetics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytics and neurologicals to toxic levels.
Medicinal products in GEFAHR – The same Agency for Medicinal Products had warned doctors and patients two years ago about the risks of this mixture and emphasized what is to be drunk with medicines such as Diazepan or methadone.
IT IS NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, although there are still uncertainties, not to have a doctor or pharmacist to ask," the expert of the Ansa Agency emphasizes.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is at the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of Enron’s collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A forecast that did not receive little controversy as a response and that the economy was still held back years later, however, has proved to be absolutely correct today.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public view," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package appears
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freeers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is being monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now more Spartan-designed Start menu, it is now finally one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against it was also compatible with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time to preserve the original appearance image of the page.
It is also possible to generate "hybrid" PDF files that expand the typical graphics of the Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by several users, avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the text processing system, a request will be given to each processor to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result should be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
If freedom of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed: in the end, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a training offer, which means optimal aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writers, the Word-related text generation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at a push of Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with Powerpoint; Database to operate databases instead of more known access; and lastly, Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded by 3 million and 600 thousand now.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping fall opens to me as part of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-classist and winner of the best climber's shirt.
The message was published by the L'Equipe daily newspaper on its website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who was tested positive for Cera, the third generation’s epoch. Previously, this was the case with the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of coal include those made by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry in recent weeks.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrians will lose their third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordy confirmed the positive Epotest, and informed the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian went behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also addressed the triangle of the best climber for himself.
THEME INTRODUCTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALIAN RASSIST?
Italy, "the single country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only being taken up by opposition.
Does this make a nation of racists from Belpaese? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted to the whole issue of racism in Italy and comes out of the case of the young man from Burkina Faso, consistent with Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a pack of biscuits.
The case testifies to what the Times refers to as "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiment and the biggest support of the League of the North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times draws attention to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also referred to as signs of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlines the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State in the fight against racism."
Student victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The housing market for students does not know any crises.
According to the last survey of the Sunia, the rental agency, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very heavy trains. A lot of students are losing their right to study so effectively because their families are not able to support them at this level" – according to Sunia's supervisor Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand from the students leads to a distortion of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without price limits, unauthorized rentals.
For the Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures leading to a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
For more detailed consideration of the investigation, it appears that in Milan a sleeping place is needed in the Brianza quarter of about 450 euros; a single room begins at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping space costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the districts around the university, there are 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices are around the Union at around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rentals in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in Ostia and Cinecittà.
Only those who can save money in the outdoor district: 300 Euros for a sleeping space and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room of at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where renting to non-European students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
Looking back to the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas are closed because of the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image by Director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of delimiting the cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multi-story complex in the periphery, in the long term means the death of the single-story cinema in the center. A process that not only appears irrevocable and irrevocable but also carries the tracks of a cultural crime.
Most of them are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you have laid a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the great price of Cannes. It's about the history of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably forever lost cinema.
The figures supplied by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the unhappily quantities of 316 traditional cinemas have had to be closed; they paid most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia Romagna with 82 missing cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been recorded: with 195 in the last five years, Lombardy is leading the list, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all, the preservation of the existing one, because it closes a hall in the city, not all of his family customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here, the lack of State resources for the business association fund is out of the question: the debt burden recorded by the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to receive the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million would be needed in the year".
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of its fears about the old cinemas, has decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The planned measures also include tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in relation to road transport: it will be allowed to drive in the traffic restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking charges.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
But of course we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to set something up against the superpower of the multiplex cells, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "supercinema" by Bagiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to establish the "New cinema Paradise", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass by the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid having to see the dust-covered poster.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Pyromalli.
The accusations of the Antimafia Authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for the development of mafia shops, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also taken into custody: the lawyer, who bears the same names as the clan's boss, had already been sentenced to 10 million euros for developing criminal associations.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm neglecting," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"So the Mafia group was made possible – so the judges – to officially enter the Council houses and agree on public administration policies."
The president of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee of the Calabria region does not condemn the fact that in his region there is "all other than an exception to the linkage between local administrations and organised crime." There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white west."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the Clan Piromalli police have been excommunicated.
Since the end of April, the municipality of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians of their community offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then Udc Mayor, was elected head of the Middle Law Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He screamed when the prefecture arranged the settlement of the municipality.
He was interested in the vice-minister Marco Minniti, who wanted to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Pyromalli clan had even dared to apply for an amendment of the A3 project.
From a hearing in connection with the Dal Torrione case investigations, it has been shown that it is willing to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Pyromalli – thus the measures of the public administration were identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, suddenly the big ones run on
It is a non-satisfied source of money covering over 70% of the planet's surface and only now it seems to understand the world's large energy companies.
Waves, currents and times are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking for, and also seeking to occupy, such as giants as Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; these studies have not, by chance, intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the oil price fell by 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This is equivalent to the double energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, currents and times are still coming.
Giants at the attack.
The first company now operating on maritime energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the creation of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector that are putting on the marine energy gain.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – says the speaker of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and denies the possibility of working with us."
This is about obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is needed to start a project on the coast of Alaska.
This is a non- underestimating sign, for example when you think that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska and President Bush recently put in place plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the Verdan Power Inc. companies from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are unknown, but observers say of an increasing interest.
Improving technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still emerging, not least since the last doubts about environmental protection have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small size and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy to a large extent, technologies with far greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various options: Ocean Power uses, for example, a system of connected Bojen.
The push of the waves that move the bojeen up and down is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via flasks and cylinders.
This triggers a turbine that again operates a generator.
The current is then sent over underwater lines to the coast.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval, and part of the energy gained could also serve military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the times are driving the turbines that feed the generator through the rotating movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential customers are already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
Only the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Recovery, special interest is currently worth the potential that lies in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the weather is better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely what modern energy countries, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have done to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
