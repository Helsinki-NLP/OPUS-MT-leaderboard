How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all the breast muscles must be handled in this way especially at your age
And together with the dam.

Cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) which increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trains in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, which confirm that, although it is different depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital and the intensive care unit, it should increase its preparedness to launch a COVID-19 patient who will need medical attention, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the cluster of unknown etiology pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Control and Prevention of Tiongkok Disease reported the cause of this disease was a new coronary virus now called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronary disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 suffers from mild respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of the suffering cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a more severe disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of other cases experienced a critical disease that needed intensive care.
Mortality of patients treated in the hospital due to COVID-19 about 4%.
In this study, we studied the cumulative COVID-19 U.S.A./European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) and compared it with the Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases currently in EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy during January 31st–March 15, 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 experienced a broader geographical preaching and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world at this time following the dynamics of the pandemic in Tiongkok.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed on the basis of the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to the returnees from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 case was detected throughout 30 EU/EEA countries and Ingris Raya (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get a cumulative number and a cumulative incident in the COVID-19 case
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide is updated every day at 8 a.m. This number is only obtained from official sources such as the country's Cementrian Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate COVID-19 trains in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare them with trains in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of the COVID-19 case, we count the accumulated cumulative incident 14 days, so counting the natural journey of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported to each country by 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the UK generally follow a train in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incident began to increase around 21 February, and increased sharply around 28 February 2020.
This train is particularly encouraged by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar cumulative COVID-19 incidents (Additional database).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The data indicate that, until 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italy cases three weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increases rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Train watching the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pantomime is increasing at a speed comparable to that of all countries.
This is out of the differences in degrees across countries, variations in public health response, and possible differences in country definition and protocol differences to choose patients to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, which includes a blood test.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who reportedly explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in this area had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on the receiving of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current monitoring data focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensification sleeping facilities and madia treatment in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The modeling scenario related to the decline in health care capacity, with the prevalence estimates of COVID-19 treatment for each EU/EEA country and the UK that relate to risk >90% exceed the capacity of intensive care bed, is provided in the sixth ECDC rapid risk assessment update on COVID-19.
Because so far the most clastic cases in certain areas in EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a specific regional service coverage population, information on the case and intensive care bed should be provided at the United Kingdom level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trains in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of patients in need of COVID-19, especially intensive care, as in the affected area of Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, rapid, proactive, and comprehensible approaches are very important to slow down the preaching of SARS-CoV-2, with changes from the trend towards mitigation approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adopt the correct response if it is not implemented previously.
The rapid risk assessment also outlined public health steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available when the country has the possibility to increase its control effort in slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 ministry and reducing the pressure on health care.
If failure occurs, another EU/EEA health care system is likely to face a patient who needs intensive treatment within a few days or weeks to come.
The disease of coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tiongkok and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Even so, COVID-19 has a lower level of degradation and mortality than SARS, but it's more glaring and more about age than young people, and more about men than women.
As a response to the increasing number of publications on this new disease, this article tries to provide timely and comprehensible insight into the subject of rapid development.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this prospect will help us to understand and deal with the threat of disease.
The Semi Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a memory that has never happened and has not been forgotten for all the Tionghoa people who were ordered to stay at home during vacation and weeks after the outbreak of new virus disease.
This virus is very homologous with the coronation virus (COV) that caused acute respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it caused is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread throughout the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "enemy number one" enemy and potential destroys stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020, which established a sequence of virus isolated from some patients, more than 200 were published about COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and care.
These targets include research progress in this fast - growing field of new subjects.
In some cases, we'll try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and the disease caused by other CoVs, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012.
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis and some other unanswered but urgent questions.
According to tradition, coV is considered a non-lethal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% of pills 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic coV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV, each causing the initial plague in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
That's why, COVID-19 is now the third COV plague in recorded human history.
As shown in G. 1.1., the Pneumonia cluster was originally unknown when it was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tiongkok.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, a health care provider infection was reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, the quarantine area was treated in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transportation was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly contact the Wuhan marine food market considered to be the initial site of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this plague a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, this disease has spread to all parts of the world and to nearly 50 other countries.
Because of the rapid growth of the situation, the end of the present system of things and the horrific conditions still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-stakeholder study on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 patients, showed a more up-to-date picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected over 50 years old, only a little under 20 years old, and only 14 infected under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expands into clusters, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 consumes an average time of 5 (2-9) days from the examination to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time starts from dawn to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Base reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before the 23rd of January 2020, according to mass transportation time before the Semium Festival in Tiongkok.
Mortality with confirmed 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality adjusted for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are male (man), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a large group of viruses containing single RNA senses.
CoV can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and deltas, with alpha- and beta-coV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tone or spike (S) is associated with its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) exchange enzyme and peptidase 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA gene is released into a cytoplasm; after viral replication, genomic RNA is included in samples of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein form a VE containing virion, which then undergo fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is a new beta-COV type with more than 99.98% of the 10 samples followed; the sample was taken from the origin of the plague, namely the Juan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERCS-CoV.
Through electron-transmission microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very small human breath channel epithelium.
ACE2 humans found is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S SARS-CoV-2 protein is associated with ACE2 humans less than its binding to S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-separable infections of SARS-CoV infection in the patient.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins with orf3b and secreted proteins with orf8 password.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may play a role in virus pathogenity and IFNβ expression inhibition; however, orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM ACE2 complete human structure in resolution 2.9 Å in complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformation, is arranged to form dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which is evidence of coV detection and infection.
B0AT1 can be developed as a therapeutic target in the drugstore to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and Intermediate Ingen
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each is transmitted to humans through vines and vines.
Using the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with another CoV, bats are considered to be the original SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two CoV similar-SARS of bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, among other things, the virus helps to prevent species from infecting humans is not yet known, and the transmission route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. recommended snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologic recombination in the S protein.
According to one study, a study in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggested that the call, the mummalia monochrome long-circuited in traditional Tionghoa medications, potential among SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of 99% genetic homologies on the coV found in the call and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the difference spread throughout the genome is still a big difference; therefore, the final result as concrete evidence is not yet found (G. 3).
Physicality SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar quality.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, infection containing chlorine, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fats, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disables the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and because it is a strain against this new virus.
Currently, there are no more detailed studies that report immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another CoV study before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after inhaling, the virus is known to be introduced by the immune system through a pattern identifier (PRR) receptor, which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through a different route, the virus inducts the expression of the inflammatory factor, dendritic cell maturing, and interferon type I (IFN) synthesis, which restricts the preaching of the virus and speeds up the phagosis of the antigen virus by macrophages.
However, N protein on SARS-CoV can help prevent the immune response.
Shortly thereafter, an adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ cell T stimulates B cell to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ cell T kills the virus that is directly infected.
T-cell helper produced proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cell.
Even so, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis of T cell.
Humorous immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, are also important in the fight against virus infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have been cured have been neutralized by MERCS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive immune response produced a large number of locally free radicals, which could cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of large organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is marked with abstinence claster, is more about aging with measles and pregnant women.
In general, people who are infected with the virus in large numbers or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and is beginning from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as explained above, shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographic 8.866 cases.
The most important health authority is adjusting effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so that it prevents infected people, but without symptoms, transmits the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are infected or infected usually have to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Demam is often the main symbol of COVID-19 and early, with or without other symptoms such as dry mouth, any breath, muscle pain, membrane, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after remission of the disease.
In a severe case, the patient’s disease develops rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with dementia and/or respiratory symptoms and acute dementia, even without a slight lung irritation, should be placed against the virus for diagnosis here.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that 98% of the symptoms for fever, 76% for dry mouth, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of the patients needed fan support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies in the family cluster and the cluster due to the transmission of the asymmetrical.
Compared to this, the 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also experienced dementia (98%), dry mouth (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than the COVID-19 patient and consistent with MERS lethality higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat disease (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, dams (99%-100%), dry cracks (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and convulsions (13-25%) were shown as the main symptom and ventilation support needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
Until February 14th, the mortality of COVID-19 is 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 accounted for 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERCS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV reached only 2 to 4.
Compared SARS-CoV-2 to MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-COV-2 has a higher broadcasting capacity than MERCS-COV and SARS-COV, but does not kill MERCS-COV and SARS-COV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemic.
Avitan is often found in a family or in a group or in a vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before a visit.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who return from the hospital can carry the virus again, resulting in a cautionary increase in quarantine.
In the early stages, the patient has white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) normal or descending.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and increased aminotransferase and viraemia aspartate levels were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The rate of enzyme and muscle and myoglobin increases in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood progresses in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the rate of D-dimer increased, i.e. the product of fibrin recovery in the blood, and the count of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The differences in the photo torax were found in a large COVID-19 patient and marked with a bilateral shade or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, tatercontrol inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis are very damaging to gas exchange.
The Type I and Type II pneumatic dysfunction lower the surface surface pressure and increase the surface pressure so that it lowers the lung capacity to develop and increase the risk of lung collapses.
Therefore, the worst finding in the torax photos is often parallel to the worst level of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathology analysis showed pneumonia, hyalin membrane formation, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as sensory cells involved a lot in the lungs of patients who died from this disease, according to the pathology of virus infection and ARDS and similar to the pathology analysis of patients SARS and MERS.
RNA detection SARS-CoV-2 is used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by the response of polymerase reverse (RT-PCR).
However, due to its false negative levels, which can speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is not only based on RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred in SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, the combination between disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is very important and a need to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the SHERLOCK-based technical use protocol to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects the RNA fragment SARS-COV-2 synthetic on 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a cell stick within less than an hour without needing complex instruments.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified on a clinical sample.
Because of the lack of experience with new CoV, the doctor in particular offered support to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or previously prescribed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current therapy and potential therapy with antivirals, immunosuppressives, steroids, plasma from patients who have been cured, traditional drugs of Tionghoa, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have been treated for treatment.
The pharmaceutical company is racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, respiratory failure and dysfunction are a major threat to patients and to the leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease depression.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane (ECMO), the most modified cardiopulmonary puncture technique used to treat heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
In addition, electrolyte balance care, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ function are also very important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in catocinic storms in patients with SARS and MERS.
The sitokin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is marked by the release of the sitokin classes, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNv, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These sitokins inducing immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and failure of large organs.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of sitokin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to handle the catocine storm.
Other immunosuppressive management for sitokin storms includes modulation of immune response to T-cells; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; implantation of sitokin 4 signals; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as immunosuppressive, is widely used in SARS treatments to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which have a major impact on prognosis.
However, short-dose corticosteroids are provided at a low dose until they are advised to be carefully administered to a COVID-19 patient who is critically ill.
At the time of writing this survey, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, the donation of remdesivir intravenously, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be fuelled by a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of RNA virus from another single virus, which included mers and SARS.
On this basis, Gilead provided this life for Tiongkok to perform a series of tests on the infected SARS-CoV-2, and the results were very welcome.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heart failure, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicinal products used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of a patient who has been cured and who has developed antibodies
There is a long history of blood collection of patients who have been cured of gum disease to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent the health of those who have it.
True, patients who have been cured often have a relatively high level of antibodies in their blood.
Antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognizes the unique molecules on the pathogen, and directs it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have been cured from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients who are severely ill.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, along with lower levels of inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to recommend this method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effect, some deficiencies related to plasma should be considered in detail.
For example, antibodies can exacerbate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life - threatening toxicity.
Antibody concentrations in blood are usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to treat a patient who is critically ill.
The development and production of specific antibodies is fast enough to combat global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have been treated and identify genetic codes that affect effective antibodies or make effective antibodies to essential proteins for the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the size of our antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on combinations of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are not yet known or are not clear because it is difficult to extract or verify the components or their optimal combination.
Currently, since effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not yet available, TCM is one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who recover from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are available for COVID-19 therapy.
The upper recovery rate in COVID-19 therapy was observed in several Tiongkok provinces using TCM in 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei, which used TCM only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had a mild recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very difficult because many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, need to be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends involved a study comparing Western drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time needed to restore body temperature, disappears symptoms, and sleep treatments are much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
More striking, the rate of symptoms (from light to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCMs are still waiting for better controlled test tests on a larger scale and at more research centres.
The other interesting thing is to create a working mechanism and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or combination, if possible.
Most of the patients who were expected or confirmed COVID-19 were very afraid of this very contagious and even fatal disease, and those who were quarantined also felt fatigue, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and dizziness and side effects of therapy such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
In the early stages of SARS, a number of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor accidents, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide, have been reported.
Identifying contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 plague, can make people more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of bullying, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COVID-19, those expected, and those who contact them, and the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine changes and accurate about SARS-CoV-2 scourges, and therapy plans and use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
An effective vaccine is very important to break down the transmission chain from animal and human reservoirs infected with the slow inhaler and is often able to complete antiviral therapy in control of the epidemic caused by the outbreak of the virus.
Ufaya has done to develop a S-based vaccine, which long and effectively creates neutralising antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the old age and the model of the lethal challenge and its protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before clinical studies are started.
This is probably because SARS was gone 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Instead, the sporadic case and the Mers cluster continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic region.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERCS using deactivation virus, DNA plasmid, virus vector, nanoparticles, such as viruses, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunists is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this problem is not easy to cope with because of a long time to develop the vaccine (on average 18 months) and the dynamic coV variation.
As a new disease, the new COVID-19 began to show the full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient is able to heal without delay.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, designing a disease forecast model is very important for the health care body to prioritise its services, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the clinical study reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS forecast, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mainly at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in a study of 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care tend to have concombation and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median 66 years over 51 years), which indicates age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19.
The type of cholera: SARS-CoV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complication: A COVID-19 patient who needs intensive treatment is more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events also cause major causes of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be associated with colangiosis with ACE2-positive, which can cause heart failure in COVID-19 patients.
It must be noted that the age and underlying disease are highly corrupt and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory detection: The C-reactive protein ratio (CRP) in the blood reflects inflammation or network damage and is derived as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and end-to-end recovery.
Correlation between the CRP level and the horror and the COVID-19 forecast has also been produced.
In addition, increases in dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
That's why these enzymes are traditional signs of heart and heart function.
Key clinical symptoms: Photos of toxins and development of temporary clinical symptoms should be considered together with other things to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are many immunosuppressions used as prophylaxis for infection to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive this disease have eventually suffered atrial osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and short-term treatment in patients with COVID-19.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 plague, many patients suffer extreme stress because they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and see the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on a demographic study so far, COVID-19 appears to have an epidemiological picture different from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replication in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to other coV that cause itching.
Therefore, at the early stage or incubation time, infected patients can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was believed to occur when patients were severely ill and most did not occur at the early stage.
Thus, the COVID-19 plague is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS plague.
At present, great efforts are being made in Tiongkok, which covers the quarantine of Wuhan and the surrounding cities and quarantines almost the entire population with the hope of ending the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these actions are very damaging to the economy and to other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has dropped, indicating an epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate says the plague will end in March and the aging phase will take place for 3-4 months.
However, some others were not.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which seems much more successful than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
Canada's research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conciliation surges and a patient who had been cured and returned from hospital two weeks earlier.
Even so, the signs of the promised event occurred in Tiongkok, if seen on the basis of the number of new cases, which showed that this strategy at the time might work.
Ebola is again predicted to cause one million deaths.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, this disease can eventually be controlled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus not too pathogen that can side with humans.
Compared with the COVID-19 epidemics with the SARS and MERS epidemics below.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit through the funnel or sinus, and maybe also through direct contact with the substance contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found in the faeces so that the possibility of a new transmission, i.e. the transmission of the faeces-to-mouth.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who happen to be in contact with patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both a medical mask and a respiratory mask N95 (the 1860s series number) to help control the spread of the virus.
Medical masks ensure that the periphery of the person who is potentially infected does not blow air or float on the material surface, where the periphery can be passed on to others.
However, only a mask N95 (the 1860s) that can protect against the invention of virion with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion can fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV in size, both measured about 85 nm.
Since the particulates can neutralize even five surgical masks that have been shot into one, healthcare providers that contact patients should wear N95 (the 1860s) and not a medical mask.
Besides masks, health care providers need to wear adequate insulation clothes to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a surgeon infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a mask N95; the virus may enter his body through eye contact.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear a face - to - face scarf or glasses while working with patients.
For the general community in affected areas or exposed potentials, it is highly recommended that each person wash his hands with soap infected more often than usual, try to stay at home for quarantine, and avoid contact with the infected potential.
Three legs are believed to be appropriate to keep the patient away.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologous to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a major reminder for Tiongkok who has a strong memory of the SARS disaster in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low preaching quality and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and the prevention and prevention of this disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed the fear of society, especially when the whole country was preparing the Semi Season Festival, so that this critical time passed to cope with the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Tiongkok should draw lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decision; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to non-injurious information from the clinic than wait for official reports from the doctor or officer in charge; (3) be more limited by postponing the epidemic potential at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) be more frequent in targeted and effective training to raise public awareness of the disease and test and increase the public response system periodically.
The COVID-19 plague was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to explode at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout the Tiongkok and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this investigation.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are the same, the COVID-19 plague affects like the SARS plague again.
However, there are a number of clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to curb the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 is more about age than young people and more about men than women, and the death rate is also higher in age than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit the virus when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to block the preaching of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons for SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The routine RNA base to check SARS-CoV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a patient who has been cured may be able to return positive results from virus testing.
This meeting greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress of the COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be resolved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although genetic homologies are found 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two coVs like SARS-Alevar, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from alevar.
What kind of animal is an intermediate species to implant the virus from the origins, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to numbers 1 and 2, we can't effectively stop the transmission and the plague can come back at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemistries show that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the respiratory tract cell and cause further pathological changes?
Is this virus also associated with an ACE2-expressed cell in another organ?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid diagnosis and accurate and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic take?
How did the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this pandemic become a worldwide pandemic, ending up like SARS, or periodically returning like flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
Even so, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The Origin of Human Crown Virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolution of the coronal virus (COV) and its incantations, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as seismic disease.
Severe breathing syndrome (SARS) and Middle East breathing syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how much HCV infection can be harmful and life-threatening.
Turns out SARS-CoV-2 in the center of Tiongkok in late 2019 has made the CoV a redhead again and surprises us with a high transmission, but with lower pathogenity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, so the understanding of the origin of HCOV will benefit us.
In this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Inang reservoirs among some HCVs have also been known.
Animal identification is directly involved in the prevention of human disease.
Research into coV-inhaled interactions in animals can also give important attention to the pathogenesis of coV in humans.
In this interview, we present the current public image of the knowledge of seven HCVs, with focus on its discovery history and its zoonotic origin and the transmission of its interspecies.
What's important is that we compare and contradict the HCoV from the point of view of evolution and the recombination of genomes.
Epidemi disease CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the mechanism of successful changes and the influence of the virus’s evolution on the spread of the disease are also included.
Coronavirus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses bound together, positive infiltrated, and isolated.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms between the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is similar to the crown under electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has unsegregated genomes that have similar settings.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open-ended reading rows (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are intertwined. Both are translated into polyproteins of the replica pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein was further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open-ended reading range (ORF) for structural proteins, which include tone or spike (S), envelope or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins specific to certain offspring are also assigned by various CoV descendants.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoV is classified as four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four types, the beta-CoV type has the highest number of HCV and is also divided into four offspring lines (A, B, C, and D).
The phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and ruminants are the source of most of the genes alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while tumours are the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross the barrier of species and some CoV has become an important pathogen to humans.
So far, there are seven human coVs (HCoVs) known.
Among the seven viruses, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, acute respiratory coronary syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as itching and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing low-fat respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung.
First line of HCV-229E, B814, is isolated from a seismic patient's ankle in the mid-60s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through a thorough study of HCoV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both of which cause healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS plague occurs.
The SARS plague that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating disasters in the history of the present, which infected more than 8,000 people with severe deaths of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused an epidemic that spread throughout the Middle East and the Middle East by the spread of the preaching work in other parts of the world.
New HCV 2019 (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent for the epidemic of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm has already been sounded and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the evolution of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, coVs are well-adapted and nonpathogenic, but they show great genetic differences.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenge for Tiongkok and the whole world.
Identifying the origins of HCoV gave a class of work to understand natural history, the ability to move, and the limitation factor of the movement between species.
This study can also lead or facilitate the search for animal welfare reservoirs, intermediations, and the amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which have an important role in the prevention of the coming time.
In this survey, we gave a general picture of the origin of zoonotics, interspecies transmissions, and HCV pathogens.
We are particularly concerned and discuss the general topic that HCoV's primary virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogen after transmission of interspecies to the new gene.
We've also checked the HCoV evolution train that increased transmission capacity is often accompanied by pathogenicity sequences.
The outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of HCV-229E first-line B814 of patients with selesma, various coVs have been isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some of the last generations, seven HCVs have been identified.
The short history of HCV detection in the chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first line of HCoV-229E is isolated from the patient's respiratory tract with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which is further adapted to be developed in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCV-229E show seismic symptoms, which include headache, dizziness, leukemia, and throat disease, including fever and swelling seen in 10~20% of the case.
Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and the sequence of sequences in the still inciting brain.
The clinical description of HCV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCV-229E, which cannot be symptomatically distinguished with other respiratory tract infections such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 spread throughout the world and the most common trends were transmitted during the winter in the field of advertising.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCV-229E have a mild stroke.
Only a small number of patients with a weakened body repair system that shows a low - density respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is a first HCoV screening that is well documented in human history and its etiology agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first SARS case could be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 deaths reported in 774 lands and continents.
Out of the superintendent, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with 4 to 7 days incubation time and peak viral load seen on the 10th day of disease.
Patients who were initially infected with SARS-COV experienced myalgia, headache, fever, leukaemia, and chills, followed by dyspnea, sneezing, and respiratory disorders as a follow-up symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and increased creatine kinase are laboratory abnormalities that are associated with SARS.
Alveolar fusion, epithelium proliferation, and macrophage increases were also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that cover the gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by catocinic storms, which can kill, especially in patients with weakness.
The virus was first isolated from lung biopsy open to zero patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been very devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially very contagious for young children, elderly ones, and patients with frail respiratory disease.
Correspondence, conjunctivitis, fever, and lactic bronchiolitis were found in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation as that of eight-month-old male breeding specimens suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 represents approximately 4.7% of the general respiratory disease and peaks of it occur in early summers, springes, and winters.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive larynx, which is also referred to as "cramble".
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-old men who had been treated for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E, and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 found worldwide, cause mild respiratory disease.
Although the four HCV communities have completely adapted to humans and generally have little chance of mutating into a very pathogen disease, the extraordinary case is true because of unknown reasons, as in the case of more virulent HPOV-NL63 subtypes that have recently been reported cause of low respiratory tract infection in Tiongkok.
In general, when they have the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend themselves in humans, the virulence and pathogenity of the HCoV is also diminished.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from patients 60 years of age who had acute and failed kidney pneumonia in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases originate from the Middle East, the second - century import case has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary plague occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Mers clinical manifestations are similar to SARS clinical manifestations, which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also failed acute kidneys, which so far only happened to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with high case deaths, that is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of mankind's most fearsome viruses.
In the mid to the end of December 2019, the cluster of patients who were retrospectively related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the infection of the lower respiratory tract that is taking place is caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named it COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death rate roughly 3.4%.
It has to be recorded, the death of cases in Hubei, Tiongkok, 4.2%, while the death of cases outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV with the image of the dam, the rock, and any kind of breath.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory disorder.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide homology, 82%, both grouped into different phylogenetic trees.
Sars-CoV-2 pathogens are clearly lower, but more positive than SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
Subjects of SARS-CoV-2 infection with no symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid SARS-CoV-2 preaching worldwide.
Comparing and separating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCV shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the time of incubation and travel of HCV is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows another six general HCoV trains.
Secondly, the COVID-19 outbreak is located between SARS-CoV and four other HCV communities (including HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, and HCV-NL63).
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCV community infection, which includes non-specific symptoms of light or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of the COVID-19 case can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower race.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns, having contact with the HCV community and SARS-CoV.
On one side, the ability to broadcast SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCV community.
On the other hand, there is no downgrading of SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities after several paths on humans still need to be verified, like the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, just like the other HCV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a Feses sample.
"If SARS-COV-2 transmissions are fecal-orally important, as in the case of SARS-COV transmissions, at least in a particular situation, it still needs to be explained by the next study."
What is also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is a seasonal character like in the case of the HCoV community.
Anyway, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which covers the transmission capacity, pathogenity, and preaching in several human pathways, will have a profound impact on the fate of the end of the ongoing COVID-19 plague.
The four HCV communities that caused the simple symptoms of all have been created with humans.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have created these four HCVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be the species of HCOV probes in the experimental period.
HCoV, which causes serious disease in humans and in humans with severe HCV disease, has been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCV must be replicated in humans in an appropriate number to allow adaptive mutation accumulation to fight the ingenious limitation factor.
As a result, the longer SARS-CoV-2 disease survives and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood of this virus being created full of humans.
If the virus is well implanted, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
For years, four CoV communities have been leaving the human population and have been pushing people with immunocompetition.
This virus doesn't need an animal reserve.
Instead, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that are highly pathogenic have not yet been created with humans and their transmission in humans cannot be defended.
Both have to defend themselves and perform breeding in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread to human targets that are slow, possible through one or more means of doing so and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has images similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit as an HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than the HCV community and not septogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It still has to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will create full-scale with humans and circulate in humans without the need for a reservoir or an intermediate animal.
Before we discuss the origin of HCV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, nature, reservoir, intermediate, and the amplification of HCV.
Animals act as the evolutionary faeces of HCV if they have close relatives and share high homologies at the nucleotide sequence.
The ancient virus is usually well established and is nonpathogenic in this intestine.
Similarly, the tank of the tank carried the HCoV by surprise and in the ages to come.
In these two cases, the infested intestines are naturally infested and are natural intestines for the HCV or the indigenous virus.
On the other hand, if new HCV enters the uterus just before or about the time of the virus entering humans, the virus has not yet developed into the uterus and is often pathogenic.
It can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplification agent by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCoV may have a mutagenic infection if it is not able to maintain transmission in the middle.
On the other hand, HCoV is able to create interdependence and even long - term endemmyses.
In this case, the middle of it became a natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively reveal that the SARS zero case has a history of contact with hunting animals.
Seroprevalence studies further indicate that the animal vendor has a higher IgG prevalence of anti-SARS-COV than the general population.
The month's weather (pagoma larvata) and the dog raccoon in the live animal market are the first time identified with a SARS-CoV similar virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the storms in the market were killed.
Thus, it is reported that the month of the wild or farm that is not used to the pet market in most live animals produces a negative test for SARS-CoV. This indicates that the month of the season may only act as an amplification of the average, but not as a natural resorvoir for SARS-CoV.
It has to be recorded, because 80% of the animals in Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be said that many small mammalian species also function as an amplification agent between SARS-CoV.
All of this seems to be the end of SARS-CoV.
The search for natural animals for SARS-CoV further reveals the close proximity of the CoV bat, called the Rhinolopus close to the SARS-ARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat-CoV HKU3), which is found on the Tiongkok pilot.
This pelvis produces positive results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequences through SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This coV and the other coV is divided by the nucleotide sequence homologies 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is the foundation for a new concept that bats are useful for new human pathogens.
Some coV similar-SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified from avalanche, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme is an unknown SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from the faeces of bats is shown using ACE2 bats, shells, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the conventional SARS serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor to SARS-CoV in the pelvis, with a 95 percent nucleotide sequence homologous.
Out of the high homology between these two viruses, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV induction virus and a mouse is not a direct SARS-CoV reservoir.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-COV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 amphibians and MERS-COV use the same inhaled receptor, called peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the way into the virus.
The sequence of RNA polymerase depends on the MERS-CoV RNA phylogenetically closer to its hold on the beta-coV velvet identified by Europe and Africa.
So far, there hasn't been a MERS-CoV found alive in the wild.
Mers-CoV and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 only shares 87% of the nucleotide sequence homologous.
That's why, the bat may not be a direct mers-CoV reserve.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that the Arab liver produces seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like the native Middle East in some African countries.
Mers-CoV lives that are identical to viruses found in humans are isolated from the native strains of Arab embryos, which further indicates that the liver is a real reservoir for Mers-CoV.
It is also important to note that the circulation of massive viruses with symptoms that are usually mildly observed on test vessels infected with MERCS-CoV.
It has to be recorded, the eggs that are infected need the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-ornal route, which is also the main route of the transmission of the virus from the vertebrae.
Even so, the question is still not answered because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of contacts with insects prior to symptoms examination, possibly due to human-human transmissions or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homologous with the RaTG13 coV insulated from the Rhinolophus affinis.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a core relationship.
In other words, the bat may not have a direct SARS-CoV-2 reserve, unless the coV bat is almost identical found in later days.
It is possible that animals between SARS-CoV-2 are among the wild species sold and killed in the Great Sea Food Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, which indicates that it is likely that animal-human transmission occurs.
A few recent studies based on the metagenic sequence show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as manis javanica, may also bring beta-COVs that are closely related to SARS-COV-2.
This new trending coV gene shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homologous with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coV is as close to RaTG13 as 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
Both were grouped into two subgenital viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which is part of a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2, with the equivalent of 97.4% amino acid sequences.
The thing is, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are even more different, even though the level of homolog is consistent throughout the higher through.
A previous study on a diseased breakdown also reported the detection of contig virus from the lung sample, which was also found to be close to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a different method of eradication and thought manual to produce a partial sequence of about 86.3% of the complete virus.
We can't afford to call as one of the animals between SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from the call because of the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2 calling.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathways in bats, cracks, and other mammals still have to be established.
Although the highest sequential homologies on RBD were found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 straining, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homologs at the same level throughout the genome.
It's too much speculation if it's said that the rate of friction between the beta-CoV RBD relative-SARS-CoV-2 triggers and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the convergence evolution that its selectivity mediated.
Comparative hypothesis supports the recombination between beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2 straining and RATG13 in third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary factor, a lot of recombination occurs between beta-coV.
Researchers still cannot decide on the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, zoonotic origins of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63, and HCV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
The phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may be derived from cov velvet, while HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 stem viruses have been found in predatory animals.
ARCoV.2 (Rigge CoV Appalachian) detected in North America's three colors shows close proximity to HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E genetically interacted with other coV bats, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also thought to be among them.
To make it clear, the current knowledge of the origin of HCoV animals is now found in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the transmission of HCV interspecies in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed the species of animals to infect humans, it was recorded that there was a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of HCV-229E transmission of interspecies is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV bats that are close to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them, there's alpha-coV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from bats to humans.
First of all, humans, not apes, who may be in contact with apes in ecological circles together.
On the other hand, humans have a close relationship with apes.
Secondly, alpha-coV avalanches that are close to HCV-229E have different types and nonpathogenics in avalanches, while alpha-coV apaca causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of abaca getting an alpha-coV relative of HCoV-229E from humans cannot be sidetracked.
In fact, it is a direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that the bat may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possibilities, while alpha-coV bats function as the HCoV-229E gene compound, a monkey and an Arab egg may function as the middle gene that transmits the virus to humans, just like the MERS-coV case.
Mers-CoV is a very good example for the transmission of interspecies from bats to Arab beads and from Arab beads to humans.
The evolutionist origin of the mers-CoV of bats is known to the initial identification of the virus and is also strengthened by subsequent encounters.
Clearly, avalanche is a cluster of rich virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments of the interspecies and transmission of the interspecies.
A long age, a closely aligned colony, a close social interaction, and a strong flying ability, all are a condition that supports the bat to become the ideal 'virus preacher'.
On the other hand, MERCS-CoV has been in Arabic for decades.
This virus has been created with the eggs that have changed from the incandescent to the stable and natural incandescent incandescent incandescent.
Mers-CoV caused a very mild disease and protected a relatively low mutation in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance, and humans continue to be worthy of the end of the MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be interrupted.
It's not like a diamond role in the Mers-CoV transmission, a cricket role, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission different.
In particular, beta-coV-striking tends to be very pathogenic in striking.
Calling may be the end of the beta-CoV relatives SARS-CoV-2, like a storm in the SARS-CoV case.
In coming studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be calculated or reduced.
First of all, bats could be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 family virus that's almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings can share ecologically with the gecko by curing or burying only stones.
Second, the call could only be one of the central amplification causes for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 family virus.
People get the virus through the healing and consumption of meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, including pets, slow down on SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies to pets and wild animals should be monitored.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that communicate well with bats or cracks.
The original search for SARS-CoV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Out of various animal species, three main factors on the side of the virus are also important to make it easier for CoV to cross the barrier of species.
First, its relatively high mutation progress in RNA replication.
Compared to another single successful RNA virus, the CoV mutation rate can be considered "currently" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year per patch, depending on the adaptation phase of CoV to the new gene.
CoV has exoribonuclease reorientation, elimination that results in very high mutations, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress coV replication through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-COV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, CoV mutations are about a million times higher than its ingenious mutations.
In addition, mutations are often high when coV has not been properly adjusted.
Compared to SARS-CoV that has high mutation progress, SARS-CoV-2 mutation progress is actually lower, indicating a higher degree of adaptation with humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has created with another ingenuity that's close to man.
Besides SARS-COV-2, this also happens on the MERS-COV that's created with Arab spiders.
Theoretically, there is little chance that genetic discharges will quickly make the vaccine and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA gene in the CoV gave extra flexibility in the change in the genome, for mutation and recombination, so as to increase the probability of co-evolution of the interspecies, which benefited from the emergence of a new CoV when appropriate.
This is supported by many open ranges and unique protein functions placed at the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoV frequently swaps templates randomly during RNA replicas through the unique "choice-choice" mechanism.
In a fluid that functions as a mixing agent, a change in the urine often occurs during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
Full and subgenomic RNAs that are very homologous can be recombined to form a new coV.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as on animal coVs such as SL-COV bats and coV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-incineration in its connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the inhaler is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection during the interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and vertebrates, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various veins, especially with mutations to RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes the target of inhaled antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is amino acid to 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment, which is associated with human ACE2 and its correspondent as the way into the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include rats, mice, mice, and rat dogs, so that they can transmit interspecies virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed differently between human virus isolates and strains in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor binding motive for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity for the interaction of tonsil protein with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acid may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit implies the affinity of the S protein binding with ACE2 humans has probably changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the affinity of human ACE2 binding and S SARS-CoV-2 protein up to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV protein.
The important thing to know is if there's any other corridor that might be needed for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-teratylase acid for HCV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the resultant adaptation of this coV in humans after transmission of the interspecies from the animal's intestine.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end result of the intraspecies HCV transmission is also arranged by other dependency factors and other intestinal limitations.
The difference between humans and natural reserves, such as amphibians, Arabs, and predators, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV has to take over the intestinal dependence factor and rehabilitate the intestinal restriction factor to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular probes in the field of the interaction of these important viruses still need to be identified and identified.
The entire throughput is unusual to see the dependence factor and the SARS-CoV-2 threshold using the highest CRISPR technology may be useful.
Turns out new HCV: back to the beginning of the plague
The cov of the bat gave him a great chance to come up with a new Hcov.
In this case, the coV velvet function as the HCoV gene compound.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate HCoV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, addiction or the loss of a new protein marker gene can dramatically enhance the phenotype of the virus.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in adapting to humans because the virus related to SARS-CoV is found in isolation affecting various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a special elimination feature of 29 nucleotide was found on an isolated line at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive mutation that supports a significant change.
In addition, SARS-COV may have a history of recombination with alpha-COV and gamma-COV offspring, with a large number of smaller recombination areas identified in the polymerase-dependent RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the re-combination between the various offspring lines was shown on the Mers-CoV epidemic, which took place in the Arab nests in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCVs where HCoV has been recombined with another animal coV in its non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that making a selection can play a role in unexpected changes in viral genomes, likely due to the release of the virus from the current selection pressure, such as the inhaled immune system.
This effect is the loss of ORF4 complete on the HPOV-229E prototype string due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be observed on the avalanche virus and eggs that are closely related to HCV-229E, alpha-coV apaca shows a single nucleotide cell that results in sequence movement.
Finally, the new HCV evolution was also driven by the pressure of selection in its reservoir.
Symptoms of light or undetected symptoms when coV is infected, which show adaptation between coV and coV.
It seems that the bat is well placed with CoV anatomy and physiology.
For example, the deficiency in the activation of the proinflammatory response to the pelvis will result in an efficient reduction in the pathology of coV.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell on the plebiscite was pressured by increased regulation of the natural killer cell receptor by NKG2/CD94 and the molecular expression level of the main class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the rate of high-reactive oxygen (ROS) high from the high metabolic activity of the flux can suppress coV replication and influence exoribonuclease correction so as to give a selection pressure to produce highly pathogenic strains of virus when entering the new inhaler.
A more pathogenic coV strain may also develop through recombination, which results in new protein bindings or new protein fibers to adapt inhale.
That's why, it's not a coincidence that three new HCVs have appeared in the last two generations.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoirs, such as avalanche and wind.
CoV replication strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
This is where the secret lies. There's no symptoms and there's no cause for serious human infection.
Symptoms are particularly severe because of over-response and catocin storm activation, with more severe lung damage if the immune response is increased.
On the other hand, the immune response from the coV’s replication has been eliminated.
The same strategy to decide the immune response relationship may benefit from anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon's response is particularly strong on bats.
Therefore, the type I interferon delivery, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should benefit.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasom activation is defective.
For this reason, the inflammasom NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 may benefit from the management of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general occurrence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-COV is a 95 % nucleotide homologous with SARS-COV, there are 96 % nucleotide homologous coVs with SARS-COV-2.
Although insects and other animals in the market were found to have a virus identical to SARS-CoV, the mean of direct for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
Beta-CoV triggering that is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which shows that the triggering may be one of the interferences or beta-CoV triggering may contribute the gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still asked, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is deliberately and unintentionally made by humans.
CoV is back to the center of attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 plague.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reserve for HCoV on human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERCS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 come from the bat and are transmitted to humans through the middle wave.
Remember that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and wetlands in the wet market, maybe closing the wet market and killing all wetlands in it that effectively ends the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the cracking should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, remembering that there are some sequences of beta-CoV cracking strains that are close to SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through calls and other mammals still need to be explained in future research.
On the other hand, MERCS-CoV has been in Arabic wool for a long time.
It works as an important transport tool and as a main source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
The Arabians are spreading throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the eggs to control the MERCS, as we did in the wild animal market in Tiongkok to prevent the preaching of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the mers plague, a compassionate approach must be made to develop an effective vaccine for mers-cov eggs and combined with other measures of infection control.
Before we manage to eliminate this virus, a new genotype can develop and cause damage.
Various zoonotic coVs go wild.
In particular, the coV of the zoonotic potential is very diverse.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic coV to evolve and experience recombination, which results in a new coV that is easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in Tiongkok had to be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, preparation and better management plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there's a chance to preach.
Although insects have many features that support the spread of the virus, humans have access to insects and other species of the wild.
Surveillance on mammals needs to be done to understand more about the ecology of the coV and its nature, which will prove to be useful in preventing transmission of animals and coming plagues.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonotic viruses is for humans to keep a distance from the ecological revolving of the natural reservoir of the zoonotic virus.
Some of the original zoonotic parts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
First, if the bat transmits the ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to the trigger, the condition when the bats and the triggers share the ecological relay is an important thing to know.
Second, if the bat has a more direct role in the transmission to humans, the human contact with the bat must be determined.
Third, if there are third mammals that play a role as midwife, the way the mammals interact with other species, which include humans, bats, and triggers must be explained.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may slow down against SARS-CoV-2, well test infection and surveillance should be done.
I don't know whether it's a rat, a trigger, or another mammal, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its native virus, which is almost identical, can be identified in its natural origin in the future.
Research in the field of shock will evaluate the evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with an important role in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of the diagnostic criteria "case suspected" and "case confirmed" COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice for diagnosis and management of new coronary virus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV).
However, coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies continue to be updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for the "supposed case" and "confirmed case" based on the diagnostic and management manual for COVID-19 (version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tiongkok.
In December 2019, the new coronary virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a disease, which is now formally referred to as the coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been named the coronary syndrome acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed the quick advice guide and the guidance has been published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has been a source of great interest since its publication.
However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies continue to be updated.
As an example of the Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tiongkok (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, this Commission has issued a total of seven editions with a considerable number of contexts.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who introduced the offer of a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guidance and proved to be a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We supported their significant work and expressed our appreciation for it.
Even so, the results of their work also need to be updated on the basis of the diagnostic and maintenance guidelines for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh test version) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), a combination of one of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations is expected to be confirmed in order to make comprehensible analysis, or to remove three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or another community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the symptoms test; (2) a history of contact with the Sars-CoV-2 case (with positive nucleat asthma tests); (3) a history of contact with patients suffering from dementia or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or another community where the COVID-19 case was reported in the last 14 days prior to the symptoms test; (4) a history of contact with the confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases with the disease and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in a small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) dem and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection score; (3) total white blood cell count shows normal lymphocyte count, down, or decrease in the early stage of abstinence.
The diagnosis of confirmed case should be based on a case suspected with one of the pathogens or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR positive tests for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the whole sequence through the virus showed high homogeneity for the known new coronary virus; (3) positive for IgM-specific antibodies and IgG-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or change of IgG-specific IgG-specific antibodies from negative to positive, or titer increased ≥4 fold at the recovery phase above the acute phase.
We can see that real-time nuclear PCR tests in the breath or bloodstream sample are added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added to the fourth and fifth editions (January 27, 2020) and to the seventh edition (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on a survey of researchers to find optimal nucleate detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as a sample of the respiratory tract including blood intake, which enhances the availability of various specimens, and supports the incorporation of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us of a patient who is diagnosed with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. range should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in the near future.
As a conclusion, we looked forward to more direct evidence and asked the reader to comment.
For diagnosis of "expected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend that we follow and obey the latest guidance in each country.
Our team will also periodically update our guidance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest day's death
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death count in one day due to that virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported a number of reported infections involving 114 active cases and 33 house - to - house rehabilitation cases.
Recorded a total of 17 deaths.
In a news climate, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader said public transport would be stopped longer than planned again until Saturday.
This public transport stop began on March 26, and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transporting goods of wood -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection incident in Bangladesh was on March 8th, two newly returned from Italy and one of them's wives.
On March 19, the three men were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronal virus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are related to COVID-19, a disease caused by the crown virus.
Its peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infection and Zambia suffered its first related coronary virus death.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free from coronal virus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 noon Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, there are more than 244 thousand cases of coronary virus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News office reported that Johns Hopkins University reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary virus infection.
Throughout the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobianin, the Moscow mayor, extended the quarantine area until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would remain unpaid without having to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament has taken a vote to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote was withdrawn by 215 supported votes, ten abstentions, and one voice refused.
Saudi Arabia extended the hours of the night in the holy cities of Mecca and Madinah until the whole day; before that, the night ended only between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to apply the hour of night between 10 p.m. and 4 p.m.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the order to live at home by 1 May.
Stores in Australia lower the purchase limit of toilet tissue per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth's network and Coles each lowered the purchase limit of toilet tissue to two and one pax per transaction in all stores at national level.
ALDI also applied the limit of one brother on Monday.
The border was announced as a message on the czar and on the Facebook page of the network.
The buyers are reported to be putting up with the fears of the COVID-19 if the society has to do a mansion isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet tissue for shipment to the house until one paternity.
This change follows the four-packed transaction boundaries that were previously applied by Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his statement on March 8th, Coles reported that with the four men's limitations, "many shops have been missing in an hour since the shipment", and called the request "never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".
The sale of "fastened" last week, according to one of Woolworths' lawyers.
Costco shop in Canberra also limited the number allowed up to two weeks ago.
To avoid an emergency, the Colleges ordered a larger package than the cook and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while the ALDI made preparations for the Special Rabbi promotion activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Association of Australia's Peritel, said that the peritoneal attempts to increase supplies, but the limits of the local government for the time of truck delivery make it difficult.
He expects to raise the cost of production, as long as the cook tries to meet the demand, and less special promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since the preparation was earlier off, some shops could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a wheelchair expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store is filling every night's supplies.
He stressed that toilet tissue is a large thing that volumes up to its low supply and, if sold out, makes many empty spaces in the front so that things get more and more.
Coles and Woolworths believe [that] if there are many things on the shelf, if products such as toilet tissue and sanitation can [buy] and are in large numbers, panic may be minimized, Russell Zimmerman’s water through the ABC News Office.
Who Gives a Crap Recycled Toilet Manufacturer said on Wednesday that they were out of preparation.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tissue Toilet Kleinex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, forced them to work 24/7 to keep the market, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property vendors offer free toilet tissue to the first handkerchief in Melbourne, when less handkerchiefs are made because the buyer takes the bait for long holidays at the end of the working week.
The edition of Thursday’s NT News, a day printed in Darwin, highlighted the eight side pages that were meant to be cut and used as toilet cloth.
The real stores refused to apply the restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3rd, they said they were not planning to apply the limits of the purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, farming, dry food, hand washing soap, and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon, England’s Okado’s online supermarket was observed to limit the purchase of Andres’s toilet to two pcs with 12 pcs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says COVID-19 as a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 that is taking place—a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronation virus—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" only states how far the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries are still able to change this pandemic.
If the country detects, examines, manages, isolates, and mobilizes its citizens as a response, the waters of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General WHO.
We are very careful because of the level of our preaching activity and the horrors that threaten us, as well as because of the extent of our anxiety.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Central Control and Disease Prevention of the United States, this pandemic "never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, there is no respiratory transmission virus that has ever been traced from its arrival to the global preaching that is shocking."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic that was cut by the crown virus."
He goes on, "and we've never seen a pantomime that can be controlled at the same time."
The new Panamanian status followed the WHO decision in January that declared this plague a global health crisis.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "in the meantime, this plague will make it worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemi kronavirus 2019-2020 is a pandemi kronavirus 2019 (CVID-19) disease that is continuing and caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The plague was identified at Wuhan, Tiongkok, in December 2019, as a health emergency that destroyed the world on January 30, 2020, and declared a hostage on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been healed.
The number of fatalities is estimated to be 4% in Tiongkok, while the world is rising from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The common symptoms include fever, locusts, and other respiratory conditions.
Complication can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The period from dawn to sunset was usually about five days, but it can start from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antiviral treatments.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive actions include washing hands, closing your mouth when it is ingested, keeping away from others, and monitoring and insulating lying for those who are expected to get infected.
Authorities around the world have responded to restrictions on travel, quarantine, nighttime, workplace risk management, and the closure of facilities.
This pandemic has caused major global economic disturbances, delays or interruptions in cultural, political, religious, social, social, and commercial activities.
Schools and universities have been well-closed at national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the students worldwide.
Misinformation about this virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobic and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people with the descendants and appearance of East and South Asia, and people from the area with a significant virus case.
Because of travel and heavy industrial closures, air pollution, and carbon emissions.
Health authorities at Wuhan, Tiongkok (the Hubei property) reported a case of pneumonia with an unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and conducted research in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is supposed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the disease is called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has recently been detected and infected with coronavirus, calling coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall sick on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear connection with the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial case cluster reported in December 2019, two-thirds were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be followed up on 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old Huongkok province, was probably the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tiongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tiongkok has exceeded the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By February 26, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds under the age of 2,4% worldwide, were reported by British science counselor Patrick Vallance, who estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before the group could be reached.
The case claims the number of people who have tested COVID-19 and whose results have been confirmed positive in accordance with official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy to avoid testing people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tiongkok, until January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistics analyst published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial calculation of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure could be 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 suffering is healed.
For those who are not healed, the period from the onset of symptoms to the death of between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, until 5 February, about 80% of the deaths occurred in the elderly over 60 years and 75% had previous health disorders, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The number of fatalities actually due to COVID-19 may be much higher, since the official figures probably do not tell the people who died without testing, such as at home, at home, at home, at the nursing home, dsb.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by 4-5 fold factor.
A woman's doctor for the U.S. Center of Control and Disease Prevention (CDC) admits, "We know [the number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by the non-intellectual report on the estimates too low in the U.S.. The too low count is often found in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of Tiongkok took place on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was held in France on 14 February.
Until February 28th, outside of the South Tiongkok, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Up to 13 March, more than 40 countries and territorial areas have reported death, in every continent except Antarctica, and in general some measurements have been used to calculate mortality.
This number varies from region to country and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the management options, the time since the first plague, and the character of populations such as age, type of fever, and health as a whole. The ratio of death to death reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time interval.
According to Statistics Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the global case is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) on 10 April 2020.
This number varies from region to region.
In Tiongkok, the ratio of death to the case falls from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other changes include cases fatality (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of infectious fatalities (IFR), reflecting the percentage of infected people (diagnosis and non-diagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a particular population.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of infectious fatalities for pandemics in the whole range from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The limit on this scale of analysis is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analyst who analyzes the impact of the assessment on the CFR.
WHO stresses that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of this plague are unclear and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University states: "Without control, the plague usually goes south and then begins to fall when the disease is gone.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this point about when that happens."
Senior medical advisor Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "this may end in June" if the whole country can be mobilised to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly for one or two years."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical limitations and other steps will be required "to provide a vaccine (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronal virus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear completely" and this disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Revolving virulence will depend on group integrity and level of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific and the infected may be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry mouth (68%).
The symptoms that are less common include fatigue, the production of respiratory spasms (flemma), loss of ability to breathe, breathing, sneezing and muscle spasms, dizziness, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or psychosis. WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, chest tightness or chest tightness, sudden confusion, walking difficulties, and swelling in the face and mouth; medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur. Further development of disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people who are infected may be symptomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm the infection, therefore, the researcher suggests that those who are close to those who are confirmed to the infected should be closely monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa estimate the asymmetrical ratio of between a few and 44%.
The period of incubation (when between infections and symptoms) is usually between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days.
The extent to which this disease spreads continues to be investigated.
The preaching of COVID-19 is believed mainly to take place at a close contact time and through a small droplet produced when it is sneezing, talking, or talking; the close contact is a contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that uncovered cliffs can cause a drop of 4.5 feet (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be produced by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking. The breath droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, even though this virus is not usually emitted through the air.
The droplet can fall into the mouth or nose of someone close to it or perhaps fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn the respiratory secret into an aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching can also take place when someone touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Tiongkok government suggested that SARS-CoV-2 should be transmitted orally.The virus was most active within the first three days after the symptoms of the outbreak, although the preaching may take place before the symptoms of the outbreak and at a later stage of disease.
People give positive tests up to three days before symptoms are detected, which indicate transmissions may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few reports of an asymmetrical case confirmed by laboratory, but the asymmetric extraction has been identified by some countries in the investigation of contact leaks.
The Centre for European Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to spread, one common person infected two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days in plastics (polypropylene) and carats 304, one day in cardboard, and more than four hours in copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although the English authorities suggest washing their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have affected the infected.
Koronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of SARS-CoV-2 are related to the coronation virus in the natural world. Outside of the human body, this virus can be destroyed if you hit the home soap, which provides the protection range. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV at the beginning.
The virus is supposed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronation virus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (the offspring B) together with two gene generations.
This virus has 96% equivalent to the whole genome level with other coronational vertebrae virus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, a study by Tionghoa found that there was only one difference in amino acid in certain parts of the sequence through the calling virus and human virus.
So far, the comparison of the whole through finding the most common genetic material between the calling coronation virus and the Sars-CoV-2, is not enough to prove that the call is between SARS-CoV-2.
Infections by viruses can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but confirmation is finally made through the reverse polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to the infected secret or to control CT irritability.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a number of punctures with pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT must not be used as a warrant or as a first line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first released on January 17th.
Testing using real-time (rRT-PCR) polymerase transcription chain reaction.
A test can be done on a sample of breathing or blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is carried out on nasopharyngal strains, but it is also possible to use an antibodies strain — a number of laboratories and companies that are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serological tests proved to be accurate enough to agree to its use.
In the U.S., serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic features of the radiographic and complex tomography imaging (CT) on people who symptomatically cover the ground glass opacity of the peripheral asymmetric and have no pleural effects.
Italian Radiological Society is arranging the international network database for dating to confirmed cases.
Due to the presence of fungal discharges with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-without confirmation has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in Tiongkok compared the brain CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific for infection, citation is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as an epidemiology device.
The neural convolution network based on made-up intelligence has been developed to detect viral fibrillation features with radiography and CT.
A strategy to prevent this disease involves keeping a good personal hygiene in a compassionate manner, washing your hands, touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing a cloth when it is ingested or ingested, and throwing the tissue directly to the trash.
A person who may have been infected is recommended to wear a drug mask in public places.
And it has been commanded to prevent speech from being spoken to the people of various regions, and to prevent all unnecessary travels to and from the lands and regions affected by the plague.
However, the virus has reached a global scale in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some people don't know where or how they're infected.
The use of location data from the government's phone for this purpose has led to privacy problems, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of monitoring limitation.
Various cellular applications have been implemented or initiated to be used voluntarily, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on a private intelligence solution, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of the user to another phone.
In addition, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who tested positive for COVID-19. A misunderstanding about how to prevent infection; for example, the nose and the wound are not effective.
There's no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is an incentive to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when their hands are dirty; before eating; and after brushing their nose, throat, or lipstick.
It's because, outside of the human body, the virus was killed by a grassroots that destroyed its prey.
Furthermore, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based handicrafts with alcohol content of less than 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of channels (in one minute of operation infected for a solid solid surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other processes, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chloride, are not effective.
CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed COVID case in a public facility, such as an office or a child's location, all areas such as office, bathroom, public area, electronic devices together such as tablets, touch screen, keyboard, remote control, and ATM machines used by suffering, should be infected.
Health - care organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with chewing gum or use tissue when swallowing or chewing, and then immediately discard the tissue.
Drug masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because using masks can limit the volume and length of the expiratory droplets that are spread when talking, squeezing, and squeezing.
WHO has issued instructions on time and manner of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using masks can reduce people's tendency to touch with a clean hand, which is the main source of speech."The mask is also recommended to be used by those who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for COVID-19, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of a nonmedicine face mask made of cloth. Put it specifically recommends the use of a medical mask once used for a healthy society, especially when approaching (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a drug mask when using public transportation or living in many places.
Thailand’s health agency encouraged people to make clothes in their homes and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit their people from going out to public places without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a face mask as they went to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government arranged for everyone who entered the hall to wear a facial mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear a face mask while in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since the middle of March, has forced train passengers and coaches to wear facial masks on April 1.
Panama obliges the use of facial masks every time outside the house, and recommends making facial masks for those who cannot buy facial masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also called physical limitations) is an act of infection control that is intended to delay the preaching of the good news by minimising close contact with individuals.
Social restraints include quarantine; travel restrictions; and school graduations, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
People can apply social restraint methods by staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding many areas, using uninvited greetings, and caring for the physical distance from others.
At present, many governments are forced or have social restrictions in the affected areas.
The maximum number of people to be recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations is rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if no COVID-19 is known in one area), to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibits meetings in public areas involving more than two people.
The use of the term "social restraint" has the effect that people must isolate themselves completely socially and do not induce people to stay in contact with others by alternative means.
This recommendation includes the urge to have sex only with those who live with you and who do not have virus or virus symptoms.
Insulation in the home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those expected to be infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, many governments require or recommend quarantine for the entire population living in the affected area.
Quarantine instructions stand out most narrowly for those who include high-risk groups.
A person who may have been exposed to COVID-19 suffering and who has recently traveled to the country or region with the extensive preaching of COVID-19 who has been recommending quarantine for 14 days since the last sentence was possible.
A strategy in disaster management is to confuse or suppress, as well as to mete out.
Obstacles were made at the early stage of the plague and aimed at tracking and isolation of infected people and taking other steps to control the infection and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the whole population.
When it is no longer possible to stop the preaching of the good news, try to shift further to the extent of mysticism: these steps have been taken to slow down the preaching work and reduce its impact on health and public health care systems.
The combination of interfering and methification actions can be performed at the same time.
Suction requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the control of foot-and-mouth disease is an effort to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known to indicate the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of exposure to health care and provides more time for the development of vaccines and medications.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to deal with the scourge include individual prevention, such as hand cleaning, facial masking, and quarantine; steps in the public level for physical limitations, such as closing schools and canceling mass meetings; community involvement to stimulate reception and participation in such interventions; and steps in the level of the environment, such as surface clearance.
Other countries also apply various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced local mass and quarantiners, and warned of the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected quarantiners who stand and wear large dentures for those who fail to do so.
The simulation for England and the United States shows that mitigation (slow but not halting the preaching of epidemics) and suppression (returning epidemic growth) has a major challenge.
Optimismary policies can reduce demand peaks for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and weakened health systems.
Supression can be chosen, but it still needs to be maintained during the virus leaving the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first to be achieved), because if not, the swelling will quickly re-run when the suppression steps are taken.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has had an impact on society and the economy.
There is no specific antivirus drug approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is being made, which includes existing drug testing.
Taking flu drugs that are sold free, drinking enough water, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the level of obesity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient’s condition.
Some of the lives previously approved for the treatment of another virus disease are being investigated to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home administrations" can eliminate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing the capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is a basic step in responding to the scourge.
ECDC and WHO regional European offices have issued guidance on primary health care and hospital care in order to divert resources from various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible canceling electrical procedures, separating and isolation of positive patients with COVID-19, and improving intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of fans and sleeping places.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (which is called the patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronation virus can be traced back to December 1, 2019, at Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronation virus in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Food Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has the origin of zoonotic.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Center's Wuhan Hospital told their colleagues about the "sars-like coronation virus".
Eight of this doctor, including Li Wenliang, was warned by the police because of the spread of false villages, and others, Ai Fen, were advised by his superior because of the warning he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Not many cases of pneumonia are reported to health authorities in Wuhan, who then launched an investigation early in January.
Early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Tiongkok provinces, supported by migration during the New Imlek Year and because Wuhan is the transport center and the main railway transit site.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States has exceeded Tiongkok and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 have been healed.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restrict free movement and make border controls.
National responses include steps in conflict, such as quarantine (known as housekeeping orders, shelter orders in the area, or regional quarantine) and at night. On 2 April, almost 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were in a type of regional quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million were quarantined in the Philippines, about 59 million were quarantined in South Africa, and 1.3 billion were quarantined in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a type of regional quarantine situation, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about half of the world's population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report shows the earliest case on 17 November.

Tourism is one of the most severe sectors of the world because of travel bans, public coverage including tourist sites, and government actions that limit travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to little demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Quantas, while the British Flybe regional airline crashed.
The impact on the shipping industry is on a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and railway stations have also been shut down.
The epidemic was close to Chunyun, the main travel season related to the New Imlek Year's holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and regional governments, including the New Year's Imlek festival, and private companies were also hosting closing shops and tourist destinations, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Imlek New Year’s events and tourist resorts were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 of 31 provinces, cities, and Tiongkok districts, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10 and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are the producers of 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong improves disease control to the highest level and announces emergency situations, closes school until March, and cancels the New Year's celebration.
Visits to European and Latin America for 40 percent.
North American and Central American explorers experienced a 50-60% decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43% census and a foot-and-mouth trip to the shopping mall in March compared to February.
The centre operator around the world is involved in additional steps, such as increased sanitation, thermal surveying to check the temperature of the buyers, and the cancellation of the event.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak of Wuhan, some 5 million people in Tiongkok lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million American workers lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the crown virus may cause a loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%. The region quarantine in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid over a day’s wages). Survey by Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered some kind of job losses. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they were quarantined in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, a total of 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany applied for a short-term work plan to government subsidies for their officials, called Short Work.
The German short-term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the art sector and cultural heritage seem to be vastly superior to the Panamanian industry, which has an impact on the operation of organizations and individuals, both employed and established.
The arts and culture sector organizations strive to support their mission (often publicly owned) to give cultural heritage access to society, to protect the safety of workers and society, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, all over the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with exhibitions, events, and shows cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. The impact of this new disease and its rapid development is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, and detention.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy City in Rome, which fell during the last week of the Christian Prapashkah’s restoration season, was canceled.
Many groups encourage Christian elders to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services through radio, direct broadcasting, or television, while others offer drive-in services or public speaking.
With the closing of the church and the chapel of the Roman Catholic Church and the removal of it from the territory of Saint Peter by the Christian emperors, other religious bodies also canceled the services and restrictions of public meetings at the churches, churches, synagogues, temples, and temples.
And the people of Al-Masjid-al-Haram (at Makkah) said: "Verily, the people of Al-Masjid-al-Haram (at Makkah) are not allowed to enter.
It has caused the most significant disturbance to the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-2020 Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the Euro 2020 UEFA, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
This scourge undermines the plan of the Hot Spring 2020 Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "reschedule until 2020, but will not be more than summer 2021."All over the world, casinos and other gaming venues are closed and direct poker tournament broadcasts are suspended or cancelled.
As a result, many players have moved to online gambling, many online gambling sites have reported significant increases in the number of new entrants, and the entertainment industry has been influenced by various music groups, delaying or canceling concerts.
Many big theaters like Broadway also delay all the shows.
Art explores various ways to continue to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as online broadcast concerts or making festival-based web-based for artists to display, disseminate, and publish their works.
Many Internet sites with coronational viruses are spread online with many who turn to humor and turn their attention into uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the descendants of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against those from the most affected areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and hate in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The report of February (when most cases are still limited in Tiongkok) records racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world that Tionghoa people deserve to receive the virus or receive what they claim to be a proper reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiongkok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei people report discrimination because of their region’s origin.
There's already been support for Tionghoa people, both twins and twins, and for people in the affected areas of the virus.
As a result of the development of disease to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to suffer from COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag is on Twitter.
Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported an increase in the rates of racism and aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the crown virus "Tiongkok Virus", the term that critics considered racist and anti-Tyongkok.
The Ukrainians attack the buses that took Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordering with Tiongkok, and studying in large cities in India, have been reported to suffer from related coronary disease.
President Bharatia Party of the United States of America at Dilip Ghosh West Bank said that Tiongkok had destroyed nature and "that is why God avenged them."
The statement was then threatened by the Consulate of Tiongkok in Calcutta, calling it "the elusive."In Tiongkok, xenophobia and racism against the non-Tionhoa people were evicted because of the plague, with foreigners being described as "foreigners" and targeted for "refuge".
Many newspapers that use payouts have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus connections.
Many scientists have thus made available open access to disease - related science.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share the results on the server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 only.
This test was used to confirm new infection or to prove that it was still active.
Antibodies (serology) detection can be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibodies show a number of people who have been infected, who have become too light to report, or who have been left without symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of the group's vulnerability in the population can be determined from this test.
Due to limited testing, until March 2020, no country has data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23rd, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests that countries have made.
This variability may also have a significant impact on the number of fatalities reported, which are likely to be too high in some countries.
Using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal or spout samples.
In general, results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests carried out on the throat strain can only depend on the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continues to be replicationd in the lungs.
As an alternative, for those who have been tested in the second week, the sample can be taken from the airstream through the inhaled catheter or the material released through the sponge.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed SARS-CoV-2 detection devices based on the PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) which passed on January 28, 2020.
This device seeks the "E" gene that has all beta coronavirus, and RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In Tiongkok, the BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use consent from the National Medical Administration of Tiongkok for PCR SAR-CoV-2 detection devices. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has allocated RT-PCR Real-Time Koronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panel to the public health laboratory through the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test apparatus produces results that are not convincing because of reactive errors, and the number of tests in the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day during February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered to be unrestricted until 28 February 2020, and only after the laboratory of the country and the local laboratory are allowed to perform the tests.
This test was approved by the United States Agency for Medicinal Products and Food on the basis of an Emergency Use Authorisation. The US Commercial Laboratory began testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made a COVID-19 test available nationally on 9 March 2020.
There are no quantification limits announced; the collection and processing of specis should be done according to the CDC specification.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Department of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, it was registered by the Federal Health Care Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that can be performed within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform approximately 4.128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the system m2000 Abbott; the FDA previously issued the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests using non-PCR isothermal nuclear amplification technology.
Since there is no need for a series of temperature shift cycles, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott is looking forward to increasing production until it produces 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies specifically binding nucleocapsid proteins (protein N) are developing new coronary viruses in Taiwan, with hope it can produce within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A library survey published in March 2020 concluded that "the torax photo has a small diagnostic value at an early stage, a list of CT [computed tomography] findings may already have existed before the symptoms notice."
Special features on CT include ground-glass opacity of bilateral multilober with peripheral distribution, asymmetries, and posterior.
Subpleuric domination, crazy paving, and consolidation are all about disease development.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT at the baseline at this time showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with a lot of puncture tincture with pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "CT must not be used as a first line test in the COVID-19 diagnosis."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial replacement.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in individuals since about 7 days after symptoms of vomiting, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Checks can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT).
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this check, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, usually a peripheral blood specimen is used, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, usually a peripheral blood specimen is used through skin tissue.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required before the verification. On March 26, 2020, the FDA referred to 29 agencies that provide notifications to the agency as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European consent for their IgG and IgA antibodies to blood samples.
Its testing capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR checks on RNA viruses.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the infection, and early April, Raya discovered that not one of the antibodies he bought was good enough to be used.
Hong Kong arranges a schedule for the patient to be able to live at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a specific tube," they fly into it, send it back, and get the test results a few moments later. NHS England announces that the NHS is pioneering a home case test scheme to eliminate the risk of patients entering other people if they come to the hospital or if they have to diagnose the ambulance if they are used. In an advanced test for the suspected COVID-19 case, a professional health officer will take the appropriate precautions.
On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicals of Germany said that Germany had the capacity of about 12,000 tests a day in road management and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, trials were offered in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Techion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, by combining and testing further if a positive compound was found. In Wuhan, the laboratory's emergency detection laboratory is 2,000 metres away called "Huo-Yan" (in Mandarin: ˈ, or "Api" in Indonesian) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples daily.
With its construction being monitored by BGI leader Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the associated cost for quarantine management can double if this test capacity is not available.
Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by the Hua-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout Tiongkok.
On 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The design of multiplex open source produced by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 by using only 93 tests. The design can be carried out in a small laboratory without needing the maintenance of robotic fluid.
Until March, the lack and insufficient number of reactors have become a necessity for mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers have been trying to explore the sampling protocol involving sample heating at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA for further testing.
This is achieved by a combination of rapid testing and the purchase of mass-scale laboratory results from groups 42 and BGI (based on an emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" in Tiongkok).
Built in 14 days, this lab is capable of doing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory that has this scale outside of Tiongkok.
Various test recipes that measure the genetic profiles of the coronary virus were developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of test equipment sent to countries with low capacity without any source of development.
German prescriptions were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the United States Disease Control Centre were not available until January 28 to delay the testing available in the United States. At the beginning of the plague, Tiongkok and the United States had a problem with testing tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide sufficient testing tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that extensive testing in South Korea helps to reduce the preaching of new coronary viruses.
Test capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow down the increase in COVID-19. A high demand for testing because of the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for operations in the U.S. private labs, and the preparation of weapons and chemical reactions became important.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported accuracy problems on their test equipment.
In the United States, CDC-developed test tools have "noise"; the government then removes the barrier of bureaucracy that prevents testing by private individuals. Spanish buys test tools from the company Tionkok Shenzkok Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but finds that the results are not accurate.
The company explains that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to correct use of test equipment.
Kementrian Spanyol said that they would pull out the wrong tool, and replace it with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeeasy. 80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from Tiongkok produced false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test tools from Tiongkok that were clearly not accurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that this test device be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of Turkey's Federal Health says the test equipment bought by Turkey from Tiongkok has "high error rate" and they don't "use it". British Raya bought 3.5 million test tools from Tiongkok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
Tests, followed by quarantines of those who tested positive and tracked those who contacted positive SARS-CoV-2, produce positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vó Italia, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests across the population of 3,400 people, about 10 days away.
About half of those who tested positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found are quarantined.
With travel restrictions to this community, there was no new infection at all.
By tracking aggressive contacts, bordering entry, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 crown virus pandemic in Singapore has developed much slower than other developing countries even without extreme limits, such as the closure of restaurants and railway companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened right after the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics by tracking aggressive contacts, bordering entry, testing, and quarantine, but by quarantine areas that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples of COVID-19 and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
From 16 reference laboratories, 7 exist in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following section, the "positive test result" column was influenced by the country's test policy.
A country that only examines those who are treated in the hospital will have a percentage of positive results higher than a country that examines all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, as well as other factors.
Washing hands, also called hand cleaning, is cleaning someone's hands to eliminate dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at a certain "critical hour" throughout the day prevents many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are produced through the faecal-oral route.
People may also experience respiratory disease, such as influenza or selesm, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., facial membranes).
Five critical times during the most important day to wash hands with soap are: before and after washing large water, after cleaning the child’s back or changing the back, before breast-feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food, or eating meat, fish, or raw meat.
If there is no water or soap, hands can be cleaned with sand, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing pops or cleaning up children who have just used toilets.
After cleaning the bones, thighs, or thighs.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hygiene claims that there is a practice of cleaning that is related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medical treatment or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the field of medicine, but it is also important for the public.
Washing hands has a lot of health benefits, including minimising the preaching of influenza, crown virus, and other fungal diseases; preventing diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the number of infant mortality at home.
Studies conducted in 2013 show that hand washing can improve the growth of a child’s height a little.
In developing countries, infant mortality can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce the case of diarrhoea to around the same; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in a low - profile area.
The 48% case of diarrhea can be linked to soap wash. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as a lower awareness behavior in the home, school, and society around the world.
Pneumonia, the main ISPA, is the cause of the death of one infant; this disease causes about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarexia and pneumonia kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets to become the habit of being planted can save more lives in exchange for any vaccine or medical action, and reduce death from diarrhea to almost half and death from acute respiratory tract infections to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitation actions as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Washing hands also protects itself from impetigos that have been developed through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of washing your hands is the washing of your hands that is often done to cause skin damage as a result of skin loss.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that hand washing can cause skin conditions such as hives and sores, known as hand exhibits or hand dermatitis, which are particularly common among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the disease verbally: before and after using the toilet (small water, large water), after cleaning the child's ass (skinning), before swallowing the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or eating meat, fish, or vegetables.
Another important time to apply the correct hand washing technique to prevent the spread of the disease is before and after the treatment of the wound; after it is healed, it sneezes, sneezes, or sneezes; after touching the dirt or handling the animal; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has a highest rate of 97 percent; the United States is almost in the middle of 77 percent; and Tiongkok is at a lower level of 23 percent. Now there are some behavioral changes available to improve the adoption of soap-washing behaviour. Washing groups for students at a time when it has been decided is one of the most popular choices in developing countries to wash their hands in children’s behavior.
The basic health care program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a time - consuming effort to support children’s health and education.
Two - year - old worms were given two times a year, added by washing their hands every day with soap and brushing their teeth every day with fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
The program was also successful in Indonesia.
The cleaning of the micro-organism from the skin is strengthened by adding soap or detachment to the water.
The main work of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to the flow and to increase the capacity of soap.
Only water is an inefficient skin cleanser due to fat and protein, which is an organic dirt component, is not easy in the water.
In the meantime, adequate flow of water helps to clean up fat and protein.
Fatty soap, since its properties can be reused, may contain bacteria that have been used in the past.
A small number of studies that examine the transport of bacteria from the contaminated dense soap conclude that the transport cannot be done because the bacteria are equipped with a bus.
Even so, the CDC continues to say, "the fluid that comes out of the body without touching the hand is more popular."
The anti-inflammatory soap is greatly encouraged to a people who are conscious of their health.
Until now, there is no evidence that the use of antibiotics or recommended infections is better for a resistant antibiotic organism in the wild.
However, antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent such as triclosan, which has a list of long - standing strains of the organism.
So even though the antibiotic resistance layer is not targeted by bacteria soap, it may not be effective based.
In addition to skin surfactants and protective substances, high formulations can contain acetate (assetases, ascorbate, lactate) as pH adjustment, benzoate as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioner (powder, vitamin, mentol, plant extract).A comprehensible analysis from the University of Oregon’s Faculty of Health shows that common soap is as effective as consumer antibacterial soap containing triclosing in the prevention of disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
A comfortable hot water to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Heat-sweeter water is more efficient than cool-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-s.
However, with the confidence of many, scientific studies show that the use of hot water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand or antiseptic surgery is a waterless cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand-cleaning agents were non-water-based alcoholics (also called alcoholics-baseds, antiseptics-hand-washers, or hand-men).
Most of this cleaning agent is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with the anti-inflammatory substances such as Carbomer (acrylate polymer) to gel or with a moisture content such as glycerin to become liquid or fumes so as to make it easy to use and to reduce the desiccant effect of alcohol.
The addition of peroxide hydrogen to energize the activity of antimicrobials further. Hand management containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Alcohol abuse kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and insects.
Alcohol farming containing 70% of alcohol killed 99.97% (log removal 3.5, like 35 decibel) of the bacteria in 30 seconds after clothing and 99.99% to 99.999% (log withdrawal 4 to 5) of the bacteria in the hands 1 minute after clothing.
Alcohol-based hand management is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of swallowing gastroenteritis. Antiseptic hands or alcohol-suppressants in the amount of custom should be used to clean or cover two hands completely.
The front and back of both hands and on the other hand and the end of all fingers are crushed about 30 seconds until the liquid, bus, or dry gel.
The end of the finger should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing it in two hands. The Center for Control and Prevention of U.S. Sickness is more recommending washing hands instead of washing hands, especially when the hands are dirty.
Increased use of the engineering agent due to ease of use and rapid killing activity against the micro-organism; however, the engineering agent should not be used as a replacement for the right hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
The use of hand-based alcohol can often lead to dry skin, unless emolination and/or skin absorbers are added to the formula.
The effects of dehydration from alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol and/or other emolien to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand - to - hand surgery with emolytics causes a much lower level of irritation and dry skin than soap and antimicrobial detachments.
Dermatitis allergic contact, urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive in the palm of the hand of alcohol rarely occurs.
A lower trend has resulted in contact dermatitis that interferes with the attractiveness of the product rather than the washing of hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't wash their hands from organic matter, but only infect them.
For this reason, soap and water were not effective in preventing many pathogens because the pathogen is still in the hand.
The success of free-hand alcohol farming depends heavily on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abusers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been proven to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after clothing, not like alcohol, which has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low - income communities are unable to buy soap and use it as a substitute for wheat or land.
Abundant or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is that if contaminated with micro-organisms, soil or wheat may increase the preaching of the disease and reduce it.
Like soap, sand is also a disinfectant agent because, if it's in contact with water, it's going to form an alkaline stream.
WHO recommends gray and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Techniques wash right hands based on the recommendation of the U.S. Center of Disease Control to prevent disease spread include the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot water or cool running water.
Water flows by recommending the storage of the bascoms may be contaminated, but the water’s temperature seems to have no effect.
Put your hands out with a bunch of soap, including your back, on your fingers, and under your thighs.
Cocoon raised from the skin, and studies showed that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using only water.
Goose for at least 20 seconds.
Swallowing creates tensions, which help to remove the germ from the skin, and swallowing longer to remove more germs.
It's pretty much under the water.
To be in the trunk can make your hands contaminated again.
Drain with a dry sheet or let the air cool.
Wet hands and gums are easier to recontaminate.
The solids made and the embedded solid paint can store the micro-organism.
The lotion is often recommended to keep your hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands when water is not available and/or soap is not available, such as the flow of water from irons or bottles hung and opened and/or used in wheat, if necessary, in the developing country. In situations where the water supply (such as school or rural areas in the developing country) is limited, there is a solution of the water, such as "tippy-tap", and other low-cost options.
The tippy dish is a simple technology that uses a bottle of water that is tied to a rope, a rope that is operated by the feet to place a little water into the hand, and a piece of soap.
Efficient hand cooling is an important part of the hand cleaning process, but there is a debate about the form of the most effective hand cooling in the public toilet.
More research shows that paper sheets are much cleaner than electric hand mills found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and was provided by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry to compare the levels of paper sheet cleaning, hot - air hand washing, and more modern jet handling.
After washing and washing hands with hot air coolers, the total number of bacteria found increased by 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the upper arm.
Moving with jet air coolers causes an average total of 42% of the total number of bacteria in the fingers and 15% in the hands.
After washing and washing hands with paper sheets, the total number of bacteria is reduced by 76% in the fingerbooks and 77% in the palm of the hands.In addition, scientists are testing to determine the potential for passing contamination on other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of mitigation method.
Jet air cooler, which emits air from the unit at a rate claimed 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to blow micro-organisms from the hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters.
The use of the hot air heater spreads micro-organisms up to 0.25 meters from the sink.
In 2005, in a study carried out by TÜV Product and the Environment, many methods of hand abatement were used.
After hand relief, changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand mills, and hand mills have been compared to paper mills.
Washing your hands using hand milling tissue is an alternative during distribution if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand care should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after the physicist Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital.
There is an electronic device that provides a back cover to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection decreased by the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in plenty or gel to wash and wash each piece of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with fingers tied together.
If there's dirt under the hook, the hair can be used to disappear.
Since a man can survive in the water in his hand, his hands need to be thoroughly washed and dried with a clean sheet.
After drying, the paper sheet was used to turn off the water (and open the door out if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
The aim of washing hands in health care is to eliminate the pathogen microorganism ("the man") and avoid the tumor.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that less hands are still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients until they release the microorganism.
One study showed that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can reduce blood flow levels to 66 percent.
The WHO manual for hand cleaning is also available on its website for public comments.
The relevant review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand cleaning if compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has "Lima Time" to wash hands:
after it's spread to the blood/hydration of the body
before aseptic tasks, and
After patient treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (sabun "medicine" or "antimicroba") functions to kill hand washing agents.
The kill function may be desired before doing the cure or in a situation when the antibiotic-resistant organism is very lazy. To 'smooth' hands before the surgery of the cure, it is necessary to turn on and kill the cure without touching, wash chlorhexidine or iodium, sterile lap to wash hands after washing, and sterile eyelashes to wipe and other sterile tools to clean the lower thigh.
All decorations must be released.
This procedure indicates washing your hands and hands down to your pockets, usually 2-6 minutes.
There is no need for a long time to waste (10 minutes).
When boiling, the water in the lower arm should be washed away so that it does not flow back into the hand.
After she finished washing her hands, her hands were dried with sterile cloth and her wounds were put on.
To reduce the preaching work, it would be better to wash your hands or to use hand mills before and after treatment.
For the control of Stafilococous infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes from 20% of the first cleaning, and that the extra benefits received very little when the rate of cleaning hands is increased to 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three fold of infections to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between rubbing hands with alcohol and washing hands with antibacterial soap over a median period of 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based wiper reduces the contamination of the bacteria 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand cleaners to reduce the influenza A H1N1 virus and difficult clostridium spores. Interventions to increase hand cleaning in health care settings can include education for hand washing staff, increased availability of alcohol-based hand cleaners, and written reminders and stick to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In the developing world, washing hands with soap is recognized as a basic cost - effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, at least a drop in water supply, soap, or hand washing facilities in the homes, schools, and places of work makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing.
For example, in most parts of Africa’s rural areas, hand washing facilities near private toilets or public toilets are rarely available, although there is an option to make cheap toilets.
However, lower levels of hand washing can also occur because of the habits that have been cultivated and not because of the lack of soap or water.
The urge to wash hands with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and bring about long - term changes in the behavior of the population.
To walk effectively, we need supervision and evaluation.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that effective community approaches in increasing hand washing in LMIC, while less effective social networking campaigns. One example is the "Third Star Approach" by UNICEF, which motivates schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other clean conditions.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one star to three stars.
Building a washroom can be part of a handwashing campaign designed to reduce the disease and death of a child.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that try to achieve the purpose of changing behavior. As a result of the crowning virus 2019-2020, UNICEF encourages hand washing.
Some studies have examined the cost-efficiency of washing hands in all countries developing in its connection with disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of the year that has passed due to illness.
One survey showed that helping wash hands with soap significantly costs more than other water interventions and sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in a state of rest, such as a newborn mother or a wounded army in the hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand-cleaning reports: Dr. Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis who works in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "a post-modern care" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection is caused by the bad smells called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, the plague caused by food and infection related to health care made the Center for Control and Prevention of United States Diseases more active in stimulating hand cleaning as an important way to prevent the preaching of infection.
The flu of pigs in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 will increase awareness in many countries it will be important to wash hands with soap to protect themselves from these contagious diseases.
For example, the poster "technique washes the right hands" is hung next to the washbasin in the public toilet and in the office and airport toilets in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means something that indicates someone's ability to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
That expression comes from the Bible passage in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to symbolize Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands constantly to clean up her imaginary node; her actions reflected her guilt for the crime she had committed and because she had tricked her husband into doing it.
It has also been noted that after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and to value their hands more.
Further, people who are allowed to wash their hands after the meditation have a smaller possibility of being involved in the "cleaning" compensation action, such as volunteering.
The religion commands the washing of hands for the purpose of purification and symbolism. The washing of hands is symbolic, using water, but without soap to wash the hands, the ritual is part of the washing of hands in many religions, including the faith of Bahá'í, Hindus.
The Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic religion required washing their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims were required to wash their hands before and after eating.
Hazardous Job Control for COVID-19
Hazard management of the workplace for COVID-19 is the acquisition of safety methodology and occupational health for risk management for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk management at the workplace depends on the workplace and the work task, which is based on the risk assessment of the source of the disease, the level of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for each worker who may have been reduced by COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal contact with public and other work partners; for this work, steps are being promoted to prevent basic infections, which include washing hands, causing workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and doing cleaning and working environment infections on a regular basis.
Risk-risk work is covering work that needs close or frequent contact with people unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but it may be infected by an outbreak in a society that is going on or on an international journey.
This group includes workers who have contacts with the general public, such as at school, the working environment with high population pressure, and high volume wheel settings.
Hazard management for this group, besides basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high-efficiency airflow, protection against lead, and self-protection devices when faced with COVID-19 suffering.
OSHA considers the most common health and body room on people who are known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high risk if workers perform aerosol procedures on, or take or deal with specifics of, people who are known or expected to suffer COVID-19.
The appropriate risk management for these workers includes technical control, such as the negative pressure ventilation room, and self - protective devices that are suitable for work.
COVID-19 waves can have some effects on the workplace.
The workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of the possibility of paralysis.
The pattern of trade can change, either in the type of goods that are requested or in the way of obtaining them (such as shopping on the outside of a busy hour, through shipping, or on a journey).
Finally, shipments of goods from a very affected geographical area of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Infection and disease control plans can be used to guide protective action.
The article considers the level of risks associated with various jobs and jobs, including sources of employment, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for each worker, such as age or chronic medical conditions.
The articles also outline the management needed to cope with the risk and emergency situations that may arise as a result of the disaster.
Pregnantness and disease management may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the damage management includes reducing the gap between staff, protecting those at higher risk for poor health complications, protecting business operations, and minimising the bad effects on other entities in the marketing chain.
The degree of disease in the business community is influenced by the acts of bullying taken.
Hazardous management hierarchy is a work force that is widely used in safety and health to group hazard management based on its effectiveness.
When the COVID-19 hazard cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative controls, and the last self-protection device.
Technical control includes isolation of workers from work-related hazards without depending on the employee’s behavior and can be the most expensive solution to be applied.
Administrative management is a change in the policy or procedure needed by the employer or employer.
Self - protection devices (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but they can help prevent parts of the stress.
All types of APDs should be selected on the basis of hazards at work, properly installed as they occur (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly handled, tested, treated, and sometimes replaced, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and properly stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal work contacts with the public and other work partners.
Steps in the prevention of basic infections recommended for all places of work, including frequent washing hands thoroughly, encourage workers to stay at home if they are sick, when breathing covers up dust and ashes, provide networks and garbage, prepare work from a distance or work cycle with time of arrival/stage delay, if necessary, tell workers not to use the tools and equipment of others, and do cleaning and disinfecting the working environment routinely.
The rapid identification and isolation of individuals with potential responsibilities is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with acute respiratory disease should stay at home until they are free from dementia, signs of dementia, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of other symptoms such as fever control or medication, and that flexible sick leave policies allow workers to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that workers learn about this policy.
According to OSHA, work at risk is covering work that needs close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of a population's involvement in around the business location, or because someone has recently made an international trip to the location with a wide COVID-19 extraction.
This group includes workers who have contacts with the general public such as in school, the working environment with the high population attention, and high-volume steering. The technical management for this group and the high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the creation of working with high-speed communication, the uptake rate of ventilation, the establishment of a non-essential travel-insistence to the location of the sensory care, and the setting up of a service-supply window. The administrative management for this group and the high-risk groups motivates sick workers to live in the house, the setting of face-to-face meetings with the virtual communication, the creation of a time-to-to-step phased rotation, the stopping of the non-essential travel-to-sup location of the tracking process, the handling of the CVID-to-19, the processing of the processing, the processing of the investigation and investigationing processing process.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick from the other person at 6 feet, showing a cabin to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a cloth when he sneezing or sneezing.
You have to wear a medical handkerchief whenever you treat a sick passenger or touch the body fluid or a potentially contaminated surface and possibly another protective device if a sick passenger suffers from a fever, itching, or breathing difficulties.
For commercial voyages, including passenger ships and other passenger ships, the risk management shall cover the journey if they are sick, self-insular, and inform the medical centre on board the ship as soon as they experience a fever or other symptoms.
Ideally, do not take further medical care in the cabins of people isolated from public preaching, for schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there is a social gap at the minimum level until now, a social limitation strategy can be implemented, which includes: cancel field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, a class of music, or food in the cafeteria, increase the distance between the tables, arrive and delay, limit non-essential visits, and use a separate health office location for children with flulike symptoms.
If there is a high degree of education in the local community, along with a social limitation strategy, the length of school graduation can be considered. For law enforcement officials who do day-to-day activities, the health risks are considered to be lower by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to make contact with the confirmed person or suspected of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidance as emergency medical techniques, including the use of appropriate self-protection devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect the bags and tasks before being used again by using a vacuum cleaner or a treadmill and following the standard operating procedure to control and remove the former APD and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considered the health and safety of certain bodies to be at risk of high or very high blood pressure.
High-risk work includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation services provided to patients known or expected by COVID-19.
This job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol performance procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, a patient known or expected to COVID-19.
The procedures of aerosol performers include intubation, induction procedures, bronchospasm, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
The work of the body room is at risk of high risk of exposure to the worker involved in preparing the body of the person known or expected to be in the event of death; the work is at very high risk of exposure if the worker performs an otopsy. Additional technical management for this risk group includes an isolation room for the patient known or expected to be in the event of a COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and in the body room.
Specimen must be dealt with with the level of biological safety prevention 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into a different waiting room based on a COVID-19 case. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends a respiratory tract for people working 6 feet away from a patient known or expected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol procedures.
In the United States, the N95 filter close breather approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a written and comprehensible breathing protection program that includes adaptation, training, and medical examination.
Another type of breathing agent can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend clothes covered entirely or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not fed through fluids.
WHO only recommends a drug mask for the screening officer at the entry point.
For those who take breathing, care, or carry a COVID-19 patient without aerosol procedures, WHO recommends a drug mask, protective glasses, or facial scarf, clothing, and gloves.
If the aerosol manufacturer procedure is performed, the drug mask is replaced by a breather N95 or FFP2.
Remembering that the APD market is not enough around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the APD needs through long-range medical services, physical barriers such as eyelashes, with only people involved in direct treatment can enter the room containing the COVID-19, use only the APD needed for a particular task, continue using the same respiratory system without releasing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and correcting the APD marketing chain, and does not induce the use of masks for patients without symptoms.

[Covid-19] Lighten the burden and prepare for the future
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC

We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear the global human relationship and the responsibility we have for each other.
We have not yet faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, work, and the construction of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendships and concerns that we have witnessed among all our workmates through e - mails, calls, and conversations are extraordinary validations that there are extraordinary humans, whom we are quite lucky to work with.
I am grateful and proud that I can call you my workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for this world to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful this is for this important resource to remain securely available to all.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site continues to run, help pay our partners, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Since this mission and your role in it are important, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we were facing and the best way to maintain our spirituality during this time.
We are eager to eliminate pressures and support our long - term mission.
If you need to reduce your schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract staff:
Our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a holiday, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
But the world can't be predicted right now, and somehow you need to take care of loved ones, shop for the needs of trees, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't keep track of your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should not be said, but we did.
Sickness box or PTO is not required, enough to inform your manager and your team to review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main work areas can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please inform Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets accurate attention from the management).
The partners whose wages are based on hours will be paid in full.
We've said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to contractors and hour-based staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their jobs as a means of conveying stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to keep going.
SRE, SDM operations, Trust & Security, and Data Protection teams, among other things, do important work that may need additional support.
We're going to start a process with all departments to evaluate the current purpose and turn our focus on supporting the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just gonna focus on the most essential project.
Delaying this time will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "drumbling for abandonment" after this pandemic is over.
You won't be expected to work a cow to fill a time that is not realistic right now.
We realized that the situation had changed and would try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about APP?
To adjust to the new reality and to expect the working hours of the day, we meant to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the Year's Plan 2020-2021.
Our idea is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to calculate so that employees can prioritise important work, self-care, and the care of their loved ones while recommending what they need or want to work on schedule less for a few weeks in the future.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the workload and the current schedule pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the House next week and update the delegation and the team in the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, layout, and office cleanup
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based partners was probably infected with COVID-19.
However, with great concern, we employed an anti-virus treatment crew to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use antivirus fluids from the hospital to disinfect every surface, lobby, and every elevator that accesses our floor.
Buildings implement their own security protocol by using products that support the safety of their tenants.
We are pleased that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has divided the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff based in DC.
From the start of last week, our DC office moved to a far - reaching field of work, along with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our peers at NYC know, we are also discussing rentals in Brooklyn.
The discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked from a distance for the first time.
Our long-term partners realize that it may need to be adjusted and they want to give you advice:
The length of the longest period is one or two hours.
If a longer session is required, consider how to divide it into days.
Define thoroughly, make a schedule, and send out previous publications.
Make video as default, with devices such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Guide the leaders to facilitate each neighborhood, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and to record the list of speakers, and someone to help make a close note (or make a collaborative note).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy little food.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to your partner about shared work
The SDM Operation Team is looking for a web-based ergonomic guide to support the expansion of the work distributed throughout Yayasan.
Last week we've asked all the fundraisers to lead the community to cancel the public event on Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO says the pandemic is over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other limitations that could make them unable to complete the activities that were approved and that no one would be given a pinnacle because they had to delay or modify the target.
This week we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and the conference of the regional and other thematic communities.
In general, the feelings of the whole global community seem to be a source of sadness as a result of these disturbances, but at the same time relief from clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare the Meta-Wiki site to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT for special staff.
We're gonna use this time to split up additional upgrades, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're all in this situation together and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to obtain information from this email and all of the other essential information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, agenda, main work schedule, or problems about involvement, or other matters that may need help, do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and connect as needed.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judah, the Global Operation Director of the International SDM.
Do not view any such change as a recognition of our work and our responsibilities.
Rather, this change is recognizing that, at this point, our work and our responsibilities may need to be adjusted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support for our moves, and give the world of service that they give up.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, this is the time to support and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months ahead.
We need you all to exist, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is placed on the outside of the cell's membrane on the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and Usus.
ACE2 has activity that is resistant to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the number of angiotensin II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as an entry point for several coronary viruses.
ACE2 human versions are often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 reverse enzyme enzyme is a metallic enzyme that contains the lung on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has a domain M2 peptidease terminal-N and a domain transporter asamino renal collection terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I cross-member protein, with an active enzyme domain on the surface of the cell in the lungs and other networks.
ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 is placed on the membrane of the primary alveolar cell type II lung, small-use enterositis, endothelial and vein cells, and muscle pool cells in most organs.
The expression mRNA ACE2 is also found in brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancing.
ACE dissolves angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts amino phenylalanine terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and his hemodrolisis is angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, orange, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grellin.
ACE2 also regulates the flow of the nitrogen neutral amino transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the main entry point in the cell for several coronal viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV; and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 proteins to spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endositosis and virus and enzyme translocation into the endosoms within the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires the priming of S protein by TMPRSS2 protease serum, which is currently being investigated as potential therapy, which makes people hypothesis that a sequence of ACE2 levels in the cell may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continued therapy of ACE inhibitors and standard ARBs.
A systematic and meta-analysis survey, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors results in a 34% significant decrease in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also related to the mortality sequence associated with pneumonia, although the result is less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and it appears to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipopisaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours with 30 minutes of work, except for 24 hours of work.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor or in disease with angiotensin II in blood circulation. rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory syndrome.
b'COVID-19 application is a cellular software application designed to help track contacts to remove the coronary virus pandemic 2019-2020, which is the process of identifying people ("contact") who may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications have been developed or produced, which have received government official support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some categories of work have been developed to help build up contacts.
The privacy issue is asked, especially related to systems based on the location of the application user geographic location.
Alternatives that don't cover too much privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record user closeness with other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has disseminated applications that allow citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 suffering.
This application was used in more than 200 Tiongkok cities. In Singapore, it is used by an application called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track reports on people who are infected and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application has been developed by Communication and Technology and Health Care.
By 14 April 2020, the application is still waiting for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store agreement.
On 12 April, the government announced that the tracking application was in the process of further development and would be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications were planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means introducing geofencing applications for a diagnosed COVID-19 patient living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on an application-based system, which includes false positives and is likely to be less effective if data collected are limited to only a small part of the population.
To overcome the concerns about the preaching of the misleading or dangerous "kronavirus" application, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add associated "kronavirus" applications to the App Store, which is limited only to the "resm" organization or which has a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar limitations.
Private supporters express their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure made to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued statements calling for limitations on such surveillance.
This organization states eight requirements on government projects:
surveillance must be "according to law, necessity, and proportionality";
the need for monitoring and surveillance must have a solar eclipse;
the use of data must be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data shall be protected and proved to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the more severe discrimination and marginalisation;
any division of data by third parties shall be defined by law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all my "relevant stakeholders", which includes public health experts and the most marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The Google/Apple article that is sent means to overcome the monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system after no longer required.
Some countries use network-based location trackers, not applications, to eliminate the need for downloading applications and capabilities to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was agreed upon.
A network-based solution that has access to basic location data has a potential for a significant privacy problem.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems have been created and used by the central server only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system is used to track contacts.
As a substitute for using specific applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes tracking cell phones and card transaction data, and integrates this information to produce a text message to those who are infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made the location available to the public, which is allowed by a wide change in the privacy laws after the MERS was seized in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries like Germany are considering using a broken system as well as a privacy protection system.
By April 6, 2020, the details have not been fully analyzed.
The detection of privacy protection contacts is a concept that has been mapped, with a large number of research literature beginning at least in 2013.On 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on a private intelligence solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user closeness with other phones.
However, the PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort that includes centralized and decentralised approaches, not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes a Privacy Protection Decentralization Survey (DP-PPT/DP-3T), a Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called Contact Event Number, CEN), a Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanism for Cellular Contact Detection (PACT), and so forth.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leave the device, and all matching happens on the device.
The Private Group on the Media Lab MlT develops SafePaths, a platform for using privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or aerial intersection data to track COVID-19.
This is based on a study from the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released on March 2020.Another similar work is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technology and is also established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without sacrificing that data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was set up by groups that have the same approach as the most complex protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect of achieving widespread reception.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official applications an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that manages Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced initiatives to track contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy encryption.
They also publish the specifications of the essential technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
launching tools to allow governments to make official applications to monitor the privacy of kronavirus
the integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to overcome data acquisition and monitoring problems continues with the initial distribution of the system through the upgrade of the operating system, and then delete it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Repositories of drugs (also called new purpose, new profile, or new task on medication or change in therapy) are the use of drugs approved for new treatment, namely for disease or different medical conditions for the initial development of drugs.
This path is a course of scientific research that is currently being carried out to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Another study included the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of conventional plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites can be the basis for the development of effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Several SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are most important are papain-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A A, et al analyzes some of the candidate's lifespans that were then optimized and analyzed by the brains of the brain with a drug that has been approved and has the highest intelligence to speed up the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in its pre-clinical study to be recommended in clinical study design.

Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and University of Oxford.
NEW Langone Medical School is testing the safety and safety of hydroxychloroquine preventive use.
Tiongkok clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir has been shown to be "effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in the median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the medicine.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients received favipiravir and half of it received omifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceuticals Agency reminds the public that there is little and no evidence to support the drug.
On April 2nd, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for preparation and use military medicine to send it to the university hospital, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

This medicine may not be safe when used by a pregnant mother or someone who is trying to contain it.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Caletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no therapeutic benefit".
This medicine is designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a life that will be associated with SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are criticisms in the scientific community about the direction of the resource to reposition drugs that are developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO incorporates lopinavir/ritonavir into international Solidarity testing.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antivirus activity in vitro against some philo, pneumo, paramixo, and coronary viruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is resistance through mutations that can cause more serious disease and transmission.
Some early trials show that remdesivir may have a high genetic burden on resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two clinical trials carried out by the University of Cleveland Hospital, which is one for people with disease and another for those with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials taking place for intravenous vitamin C for subjects treated with cancer and COVID-19, i.e. two controlled placebos (Tyongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The New York State began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.

A multifaceted study in 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at the prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was published in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention has been focused on giving the purpose of new treatment to approved antivirus drugs and developed for previous diseases, such as MERCS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the guide of the 7th edition.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the guide of the 7th edition of Tiongkok

Also, try out in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that completes the clinical trial, there is much work to be done to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus will not be available within 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great plague spread throughout the world in 2020, which led to large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the genomes published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative made a statement in April that what should be observed in the development of vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on the scale needed, and global access.
In April, CEPI reporters reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to make an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform's advanced target for Phase I security study includes:
nucleate nitrogen (DNA and RNA) (Phase I development and candidate for vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vector virus (phase I development and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to the Milk Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be planned or planned).
Phase I-II test performed early safety and immunogenicity tests, usually done randomly, placebo controlled, and in some locations, determining a more effective dose.
Phase III testing usually involves more subjects, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are not yet in the human evaluation (still in the "praklinis" study).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that they are investigating the potential of molecular vector vaccines that will genetically modify the virus protein to induce an immune response.

On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a particle-like coronavirus with partial identification from Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with tests on humans planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump has offered the "'big money' for exclusive access to Covid-19" vaccine to CureVac, which was defended by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a friendship with the German company BioNTech, to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.

In March 2020, governments, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered power sources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing sources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit beyond the disease it's disease.
Further tests in Australia were followed by 4,170 health - care professionals.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the prevalence of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, shows the need to step up to the level of biological safety 3 in the management of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on the model of non-human animals.
By 2020, there has been no cure or protection vaccine for SARS that has proved to be safe and effective for humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS is therefore a priority for governments and health institutions around the world, and there is no evidence of a vaccine for MRS.
When MERCS is prevalent, the established SARS research can be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy for MERCS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are virus vector vaccines, two adenvirus vectors (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media positions include conspiracy theory that claims virus back to COVID-19 has been known before and that the vaccine has been available.
The patents covered by various social media items refer to the patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronal viruses, such as the SARS coronal virus.
b'Sickness of coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a fungal disease caused by coronation virus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The common symptoms include fever, locusts, and other respiratory conditions.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle spasms, diarrhea, throat disease, loss of ability to kiss, and stomach pain.
The period from dawn to sunset was usually about five days, but it can start from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have been associated with mild symptoms, some develop into virus pneumonia and have failed organs.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, especially spreading interhumanity when close contact occurs, often through small cracks or drops produced by ingestion, sine, or talking.
Although produced when breathing out, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and do not flow to a distance.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very contagious for the first three days after the symptoms are detected, although the preaching may take place before the symptoms occur and after the stage of the next disease. Standard diagnostic method is with the real-time transcription sequence (rRT-PCR) response to nasopharyngeal strains.
The use of masks is promoted for those who are expected to develop virus and those who take care of it.
Recommendations on the use of masks by different public communities; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend using masks, and others eliminate use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been reported in almost all countries in six WHO areas.
A person infected with the virus may experience symptoms such as flu, such as fever, hives, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include breathing, falling asleep or being in a constant state of mind, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and face or mouth.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as hives, swelling, or throat disease, can be found but rarely.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are observed in varying percentages.
A few cases in Tiongkok initially only with the clinical picture of a chest and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can develop into pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This time is called incubation time.
Incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can occur from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the infected will experience symptoms in 11.5 days of infection, and reports show that not all the infected will experience symptoms.
The role of the unwarranted performer in the healing process is not yet fully known; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the preaching of the good news.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and are being investigated, with the Center for Control and Prevention of Korean Diseases (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain undetected during hospital treatment.
The Tiongkok National Health Commission began to discuss cases without symptoms in its case on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of the test.
Smurfs and free water can carry the virus to a large scale.
Talk up and release more scratches or drops than normally speaking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cliffs could cause droplets up to 4.5 feet (15 m).
Although this virus is usually not produced by air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collectors placed in a hall outside the room produce a positive sample for the RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn respiratory secretions into aerosols and spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through the feses, this is likely to be a low risk.
The Centre for European Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to spread, one common person infected two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cardboard/cardus, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and corrugated steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to our temperature and humidity.
The soap and detergent are also effective if properly used; the soap product dilutes the protective layer of the virus, deactivation the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other processes, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (medicine infection), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, a sample of liquid water was taken in the middle of two days after treatment began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day test.
Koronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are on the coronation virus that's close to nature.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by a foot-and-mouth soap, which damaged its protective membrane.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the inhaled cell through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most abundant in the alveolar type II lung.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the inhaled cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of the infected people treated with cancer in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more frequently in severe diseases.
High cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disturbance during disease development, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
The ACE2 receptor is expressed very high in the heart and is involved in the heart function.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Otopsy in people who died because of COVID-19 found alveolar perfusal damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for respiratory epithelium cells that express ACE2, patients with COVID-19 are overweight with systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, the T-cells that were pathogenic GM-CSF secretive have been shown to be infiltrated by the IL-6 monositis secretive inflammatory and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphosytic infiltrates have also been reported to opiates.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the real-time polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
These tests are usually carried out on breathing samples obtained by means of nasopharyngal anesthesiology; however, a nasal or spoutal anesthesiology may also be used.
In general, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it takes two samples of blood taken within two weeks to produce a small amount of time.
Thiongkok scientists are able to isolate this coronation virus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain reaction tests (PCRs) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies (which can detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) are being developed but not widely used.
Tiongkok’s experience with the test showed that only 60 to 70 percent of the organization was involved.
The FDA in the United States agreed to the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guide by the Zhongan University Hospital Wuhan suggests a method to detect infections based on clinical imagery and epidemiological risk.
Ground-glass opacity bilateral with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and later many found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (the seven-wheeling cycle with varied alveolar supply), and consolidation can occur throughout disease development.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathology finding on otopsi is:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of pneumonia virus can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration, and the formation of giant cells is important.
Pneumonia severe: DAD damage to the alveolar exfuse.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the recovery phase: exudation of the alveolar gland and interstitial fibrosis of the lungs
Blood: intravascular coagulation diseminat (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding many places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when it is bent or sintered and recommending the use of parts in the exercise if tissue is not available.
Hygiene is suitable for rubbing or curdling.
CDC recommends the use of the cover of public clothing, some to limit the exercise by people without symptoms. The social limitation strategy is aimed at reducing the contact of people infected with many, by closing schools and jobs, limiting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public.
The border management also covers people who keep at least six feet [6 m] or eight feet [1.8 m] away.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19.Because the vaccine is expected not to exist until the beginning of 2021, the main part of managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as "determining whores".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands are dirty, before eating, and after brushing their nose, ankles, or stools.
Furthermore, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand mills containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand mills are not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help eliminate the spores of bacteria in alcohol; this substance is "not active for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol was added as an amethyst.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and the support of other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends people who suspect they bring viruses to wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to cope with respiratory failure, but its benefits are still considered.
Self-cleaning and lifestyle and eating patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for people with early-infection mild symptoms. WHO and the Tiongkok National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with chronic COVID-19 suffering.
Intensified nurses and lung staff in the United States have put in place recommendations for care from various institutions to be a free source of resources, iBCC.
Until April 2020, there has been no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some of the medical powers are more recommended parasetamol (acetaminophen) than ibuprofen for first line use.
Preventive action should be taken to minimise the risk of virus leakage, especially in health care when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health-careers of COVID-19, CDC recommends placing the person in the Tular-Air Infection Insulation Room (AIIR) other than using standard prevention actions, contact prevention actions, and air prevention actions. CDC provides guidance for the use of self-protection devices (APDs) during screening.
The recommended equipment is: APD clothes, a breathing machine or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, a breathing machine (not a face mask) is better.
The N95 Respirator is approved for industrial setting, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the U.S.
The N95 respirator is designed to protect against dust-like particles, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protection or, as the last effort, own masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but most cases are very heavy.
The type of respiratory support for those who have failed to breathe associated with COVID-19 is being actively investigated for those who are being treated with sleep, and there is evidence that the intubation can be avoided with a high flow canal or positive air flow pressure.
It is not known whether one of these two methods has the same benefit for those who are ill.
Most doctors prefer to keep using invasive ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the preaching of aerosol particles compared to the high-voltage canal.
Many developing countries don't have adequate hospital bed per captain, which limits the health system's capacity to handle the sudden number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require sleep care.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% of intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30% of the COVID-19 sufferers were finally treated into the ICU.
Ventilation of mechanics became more complex during acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurred at COVID-19 and oxygenation became increasingly difficult.
Ventilator capable of doing pressure control mode and high PEEP required to maximize oxygen transmission at once and minimise the risk of lung injury and related pneumotorax.
High PEEP may not be available on an old fan.
Research on treatment potentials began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested have been approved for other uses or have been tested further.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe diseases.
Volunteers who recommend WHO are also involved in testing for efficacy and safety of potential treatment. The FDA has provided temporary authorisation for the plasma of convalescence as experimental treatment in the case of someone's very or very vulnerable life.
Plasma convalencen has not yet been conducted in clinical studies necessary to prove the safety and efficacy of this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok launched a cellular application to deal with the disease.
User requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If risk potentials are detected, applications not only recommend quarantine headquarters, but also inform local health officials. Data analysis on phone data, facial detection technology, cell tracking, and made-up intelligence used to track infected people and those who contacted them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized a body of security to track data on a suspected coroner’s cell phone.
It is taken to treat quarantine and to protect those who may be in contact with the infected.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed the telephone location data to the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in a series of studies and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial detection technology to detect quarantiners.
Regional Health Commissioner in Italy, Giulio Gallera, said he was informed by a phone operator that "40% of the population is still moving".
The German government did the hackathon at the end of the week 48 hours with more than 42,000 people.
In addition, President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for a creative solution against the preaching of the crown virus.
People may experience pressures caused by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "It's increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic ruin is a perfect storm that threatens mental health and social well-being."
This disease can take place mildly or with little or no symptoms, similar to the respiratory tract’s disease over the rest of the population, such as chicken.
Light cases are usually healed within two weeks, while those who suffer from serious illness or criticism may need three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low.
In the worst affected person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ failure.
Complication related to COVID-19 including sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood clotting abnormalities, especially prothrombin time increases, were observed in 6% of patients treated with sleepy COVID-19, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people with the image of COVID-19 show a transaminases.
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms of stroke and death was ten days, with five days spent in sleep care.
However, patients transferred to ICU have a median time of seven days between sleep and death.
In a study that examines early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death is 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have a death rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples shows alveolar damage fumes with the exacerbation of cellular fibromyxoids on both lungs.
The cytopathetic change of the virus is due to pneumonia.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Tiongkok National Health Commission, heart failure was observed, with an increase in troponin levels or heart rate.
According to data from March of the United States, 89% of those who are treated with sleep are subject to illiteracy, and the availability of medical and social resources in a region can also affect mortality.
Mortality of the condition varies from region to region, but also from methodological difficulties.
At least a simple count can lead to death being counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of a case in the past can mean that mortality is currently being counted too low.
Perkok is likely to have a 1.4-fold greater incidence of severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4-fold more likely to require intensive treatment or death than non-perk.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% lung capacity drop in some patients who recovered from the disease, and lung research showed organ damage.
This can also lead to an intensive follow-up syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity to those who are cured of this disease.
Immunization is likely to be obtained if you look at the behavior of another coronal virus, but there have been reports of cure cases of COVID-19 followed by positive coronal virus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a malignant residual infection, not a repeat infection.
This virus is supposed to be natural and comes from animals, through widespread infection.
In fact, by December 2019, the spread of infection was largely caused by human exacerbations.
A study on 41 confirmed cases of the first COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the date of the earliest outbreak of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported on December 8, 2019.
In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region, over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, management options, time since the first plague, and the character of populations such as age, type of obesity, and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO established an ICD-10 emergency U07.1 disease code for death due to SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed by the laboratory and U07.2 for death due to COVID-19 that was clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The ratio of death to the case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a specified time interval.
According to statistics at Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the overall case is 6.9% (153,822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measurements include the number of fatalities in the case (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities in the case (IFR), reflecting the percentage of infected people (diagnosis and non-diagnosis) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are timeless and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
In the disaster epicenter in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Karnaval festival, which spread to young people, led to lower relative mortality, and probably not all of the death of COVID-19 was classified as COVID-19.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been affected.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by a blood donor.
69 people (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed because of COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and the level of mortality are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher for men in the study done in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the 1950s, with a different risk between men and new women not visible at the age of 90.
In Tiongkok, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for this difference is certainly unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be reasons.
Immunological differences are based on the type of fever, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have a carbide condition, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who died because of COVID-19 are men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked relevant data on the type of fever for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus disease, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affects men and women differently.
A percentage of health - care workers of a higher type are women, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of spreading the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is short for the crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time the plague was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographical location (e.g. Tiongkok), animal species, or a group of people, followed by an international recommendation to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is given the name coronation virus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communication.
Both the disease and the vertebral virus are called "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, Tiongkok, the virus and this disease are called the "coronavirus" and the "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for the virus and disease in line with the 2015 guidance not to use location names in the name of the disease and virus.
The official name of COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as the insulators and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needs a ventilator lid, and the cook cannot provide the necessary timescale, a local company is looking back and prints 100 of the lids needed last night.
After the beginning of COVID-19, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information appeared about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, pigs, and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "SOLIDARITY Trial" to investigate the effects of four anti-virus drugs that have been most promising.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
A previous study on SARS-CoV was used for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under review.
First, the research is intended to make a full virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead, is intended to quickly trigger the immune response of the human body to new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus absorb the enzyme ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear asthma vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, new vaccination technique).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies must be tested for its safety and integrity. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains non-hazardous genetic codes copied by the virus that causes the disease. Antibodies have been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials taking place in April 2020.
Seven tests try to evaluate medicines that have been approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The new antiviral drug aimed at forming most of Tiongkok's research, with nine Phase III test tests on remdesivir in some countries with a peak reporting time at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic study on clinical development for the candidate for vaccines and medicinal products of COVID-19 already exists. Several antivirals that are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, were combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence of redexive success.
Clinical improvement observed in patients treated with redesivir in emergency therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, Tiongkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was investigated in Tiongkok in February 2020 with early results.
However, there is a call for an investigation.
Korea's and Tiongkok's health authorities recommend the use of chloroquin.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending the daily dose of one gram, noted that twice the dose is very dangerous and can kill.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the policy of a doctor who manages COVID-19.The second edition of the 7th edition also revealed interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
The initial data show that a high dose of ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations.The studies show that early primium against tonolan protein by the cerin protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is very important for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have a major limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Sitokin storm complications can occur on the COVID-19 heavy-duty stage.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisytokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the medical manual by the Tiongkok National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
This medicine is undergoing phase 2 tests at national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe diseases.
Combined with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify the catokin storm, this medicine is meant to fight the catokin storm, which is thought to be the cause of death on a number of hits.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA on the basis of a retrospective case study for the treatment of cytokine refractory steroid release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there has been no random and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an honest cure for CRS.
Transfer antibodies that have been cleaned and placed produced by the system of people who have been cured from COVID-19 to those who need them are being examined as a passive immunization method of non-vaccin.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Neutralization of the virus is a work mechanism expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagosytics, may also.
Other passive antibody therapy, such as monoclonal antibody, is being developed.
Convalence serum production, which is part of the fluid of patients who have been treated and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Koronavius disease, a group of associated syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center Hospital, who then died because of COVID-19 after he began to realize that he was going to preach the virus.
