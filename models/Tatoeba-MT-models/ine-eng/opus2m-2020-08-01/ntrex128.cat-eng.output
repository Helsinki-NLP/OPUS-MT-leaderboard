Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned that "they identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly expressed their condolences to the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Gallese Parliament).
This debate was rooted in the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Gallese Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a cause for mockery.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "remains with Twp or Pwp".
For non-galley readers: In galleys, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the set of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and proposed various alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member said his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee responsible for drafting the draft law to introduce the changes in names: "The final decision on any qualified person to appoint members of the assembly will of course be made in the members themselves".
The Galileo Government Act 2017 gives the Assembly full power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Gallese Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee called for "Members of the Gallese Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received wider support at the public consultation.
The members of the assembly seem to be suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach consensus may mean a total defeat for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in the matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their nomination during the debate on legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum to change their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name for the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided on an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time on the fact that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebiscite on the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the change of name is just the price to be paid to become EU and NATO members.
St. Martin's campaigns stop sounding: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
" Historically, the big people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, both of them."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he said.
"Bars have already stopped being that kind of living rooms for the neighbor where people were going on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as his leaders predict "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they came out."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominiums with the kind of people who won't be of any help to the temples that stay in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they will do will accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the church of Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally there left during the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the building’s property.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to minority street traders 125th, one of Harlem's main commercial streets, who resisted the contract or promotion of black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the gladiators of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they took over the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son of his father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, proudly described the carriage as "the campaigns of the poor people."
The expert who made the chair sound the July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first wheelchair in the world that was played by a black race musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest wheelchair of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What he has sounded at St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the bishop's diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by secular leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "would intend to hand over the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contractation of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some happy people have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A bull woundes a 13-year-old boy while looking for bats in California
A bull attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday while he was ingesting in California on the first day of the rainy season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel at the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help.
Hammel says he first thought it was about the joy of having taken a leash, but then he realized he was shouting 'I've bitten!
They bit me!'
He had the whole key broken," observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone comes out of the water, I called out, 'There's a bull in the water!' says Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was admitted to a serious state.
We don't know what kind of bull is responsible for the attack.
On a press wheel, the rescuer Larry Giles commented that he worked a few weeks that had detected a bull in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper tower area.
The authorities closed access to the beaches for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK's beauty products market
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beauty product passersby in the style of big stores with specialized employees.
These large passages are only part of a significant investment in the UK's beauty products market, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors are lagging behind, and will be tested at 11 shops across the country to expand to more shops in the year ahead if the test is successful.
Investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of their loans that were previously intended for TVs, microons and home products.
Sainsbury's claim that it will double its beauty offer to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with similar brands that can be found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demanding aspect for younger consumers.
The retailer The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two Sainsbury's shops. The first one did so last week in Croydon, South London, while the second one will open to Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The purchases on the Internet and the exchange into a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets have led large supermarkets to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, shops will be more and more like large stores in an attempt to fight Aldi and Lidl's retail markets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's went by introducing Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he notes, has served to relaunch the sales of quays and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's performed a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended in haste by not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy came after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its business of 281 pharmaceuticals in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury product brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty products in order to improve the face-to-face environment for our customers.
We've invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help in providing advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "whispered" after Holly Willoughby is behind a 11 million GBP deal.
The Dragons' star Den Peter Jones left "furiously" after the television shower Holly Willoughby made himself a deal of GBP 11 million with Jones' life-style brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to engage in the joint home product and accessories business.
The business of these two media characters had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwynet Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' star Den Peter Jones angry at withdrawing in the last minute from the lucrative life-style joint business to focus on his new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furnished" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday in the center of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new submission agreements, worth GBP 1.5 million, meant that he would no longer have enough time to dedicate to the common brand of home products and accessories True.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane towards one of his holiday homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly's top priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where he would be seen for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to go back left no words to all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's center ready to be sold."
According to experts, this morning's presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company because of the important investment made in products, from kitchens and candles to clothes and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays in its launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined the presidency last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 percent of Baldwin's TV producer's participation.
Willoughby will be M&S's next ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm a ITV Celebrity presenter.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't make any comments about your business."
Hard charges... "and then we fell in love."
He joked about the possible criticisms he received by the media to make a comment that some would consider "a little close to a president" and to have such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up on you?
Trump said, laughing at the voice of a news reporter:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations towards denuclearisation are blocked.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong commented Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" by the United States at its country's first disarmament initiatives.
He noted, however, that the US continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s point of view, in turn, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare the war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now let's keep this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results — ending tests with missiles, helping to free hostages, and returning home to the rest of the U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his little focus on his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this neighborhood full of people, we'd have about 200," Trump said, pointing out the crowd that was in front of him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and a earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, which was required to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so that the situation is quite demanding," Mrs. Sumbun said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spoke of the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute at the time of offering assistance.
Given the constant strains that Indonesia suffers, the country is unfortunately not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has built shelters in case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the enormous amount of them in Indonesia is, in the best of cases, a whole challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo as a central element of his campaign had the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and he invested huge amounts of money in railways and railways.
However, Joko's government is facing the year that comes to re-election of funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectoral tensions, where most Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of street fights between Christian and Muslim gangs with knives, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the goal of empathizing with a far right in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of the Chelsea with his goal marked at a minute 89 Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The pilot moved to the left before leaving an incredible court headed for the second suit.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great raise as it pushed toward the right side of the gate.
The pilot finally started the descent above a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full leap to try to stop her and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com comments.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a touch, and I didn't think much of it, I just dedicated myself to sitting."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 at rest after scored a goal in 25 minutes through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the front of the Blue team returned a passage to Mateo Kovacic before starting almost half the field and sprinting into the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Next, he made a magnificent past in depth, which he left in Hazard's area with a controlled pilot.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish in the second suit with a jute with the left bed where he could not reach the porter of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group phase of the Champions League next Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 3:00 in London.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami in 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings because of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman of the Soupo Purwo Nugroho in a press wheel.
The city of Palu, more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a stabbed woman
The murder investigation started after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with various gunshots in Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police have asked the people in the area who have seen or heard something about the crime they've seen in front of the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan, "If the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or felt anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to the taxi drivers who could have grasped anything through the car-board camera, who would be in touch, because they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman's body they found is Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have reported that they are reporting facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one has allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
He's warning residents that they'll spend hours until they can get back in.
He could feel a police officer explaining to a man that the whole area is treated as the crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
Don't stop saying, "It's terrible!"

A number of agents remained within the agreed area controlling the floor block.
Any person who can have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or be contacted anonymously with Crimestoppers through 0800 555 111 and mention the issue 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British Parliament became the last monument affected by the discussion about "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the most pure-style destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects of England that were perpetrated by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor he did during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being remembered.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than not now, as a parliamentary defender in front of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate representation remains a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century middle-aged conflict was the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a side of this division.
His alliances as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated."
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood close to a pig court in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, according to reports Sunday China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject swine vaccines in a court in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As far as you know, I had traveled with her cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that he gave to a nearby pig court.
As he said, there was a large male pig in the court with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-pound fork had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had broken and blood-filled legs," said the cousin, of the surname "Wu," as mentioned in the news of the evening of Guiyang.
Scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor by his cousin.
One of the market leaders commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained closed and alone in order to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence on the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very rare, cases of pigs that attack humans have been reported previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, an almost 300 kg pig took a gallant farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve," he commented.
The remains of the Rosa Hurricane will bring torrential rains to the whole southwest of the US
According to forecasts, the Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and southwest America during the next few days.
Rosa had wind of 138 km/h, owning a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, hour east of the United States, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in the direction towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start to leave a strong tropical humidity in the north-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Afterwards, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest during the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of land-enslavement in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of about 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that 50 to 100 mm of rain will occur in parts of the south-west, especially in much of Arizona.
There is the possibility of laughing, since the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
She's totally discouraged from going into the desert on foot in front of the tropical rain threat.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, storms can bring storms of wind and dust clouds into concrete points.
The coming depression will lead to torrential rains at certain points on the southern coast of California.
It is possible that total precipitation is recorded above 50 mm, which could result in lower waste streams and reliquous pathways.
It would be the first precipitation of the rainy season in the region.
They will begin to arrive alone with tropical rain showers in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will run off to the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue throughout the whole of the Wednesday.
October will have several major temperature oscillations for all the U.S. as the Arctic cools down, although the tropicals will remain very warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature.
There have been differences in temperature of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the constant heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will start with heat in much of the central and eastern US area, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Plan area to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures are recorded above the average in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate to a member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, who allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was broadcast to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to get the FBI to carry out a post investigation for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee on Judicial Matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to get her clothes off at a party at the institute.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The hearing numbers were not immediately available for other chains that forwarded the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with calculating the people he sees from his office.
Put in perspective, it's a hearing similar to that of an American football party or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most audienceed chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators throughout the day's witnessing, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest is kept high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying they were voting in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was indicted by protesters when he was trying to climb an elevator to go to a view of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake stayed several minutes with her eyes down while she was on live television at CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a communiqué and, before closing the elevator doors, said he would have more to say in committee's view.
In a few hours' time, all cable and broadcasting chains were already streamlining directly at the time when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to submit it to the vote.
Flake said, in return, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate allegations against the appointment of the next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake was influenced, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of abandoning the European Union to "play to make politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a further interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "of all absurdity".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
Police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was on the LSU team.
Dieteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and sent to a second-degree murder charge, according to Baton Rouge's police department.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the WAFB CBS branch.
After asking Simpson, he admitted that Wayne had been shot by the police.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Forensics Office of the East Baton Rouge District published a preliminary report on Friday, claiming that the cause of death was a gun wound in the head towards the neck.
The department appreciates the operational group of fugitives from the state police in Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the area's citizens for the aid they have provided in the investigation that culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Aleva expressed his gratitude to the local authorities for his "diligence and seeking justice".
Yes, he was 20 years old.
On average 1,98 m, he was playing fire and he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds for the past season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "damaged" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong time."
"Things like this are those that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A spy volcano ash in Mexico City
The ashes carved by Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after they detected activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing a number of cracks and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on the social networks where a fine layer of ashes is appreciated in the umbrellas of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like now Xochimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake hit the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protestors in favour of independence faced the anti-avalot police and thousands of people joined counter-aggressive protests to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avalot police began to throw eggs and paint them into the dust, causing the appearance of dark dust clouds in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, he was beaten by the police, who used his cocksuckers to contain violent demonstrators.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, Don't forgive" face-to-face with Unionist protesters calling "Long Life in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be attacked for minor injuries during protests, depending on local sources.
The tensions have not diminished in this region of independent mentality a year after October 1st a referendum was held which was considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation rate was low, since the opposition to the section boycotted the majority vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote entering electoral colleges across the region, causing violent clashes.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration took place in the same way, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration along with his wife, said he had little hope of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he commented.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although on a limited scale, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed or detained exile waiting to be judged by their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the police support demonstration with her phone, and said the conflict had been triggered by politicians from both sides.
"Tension only increases," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, have been arrested after a car hits a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says they caused damage to the doors and the same building.
It's also possible, at some point, someone shot a bullet against the car.
A Menga game gives the Livingston win for 1 to 0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
Livingston, who had graduated this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which everything is just the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's play marked the difference, because with this victory, Gary Holt's team is in second position, sharing with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's men, on the other hand, continue to win out of their home at the Premiership this season.
But before that, Rangers get this Thursday's Vienna Rapid in Europe League.
Livingston, in the meantime, expands to six parties its invited to the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingstone does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitors' direct game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the marker long before the goal, since their direct game caused all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened up the way between the defense, but he abused his chance when he was in front of the doorway. Then Alan Lithgow sent the pilot out to try to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, which crossed the doorway.
It was good for the locals to let Rangers get close to their area, because they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The Arbitrary sparked a lack of interest from Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play the first and finish from the central part of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated the possession, but he found himself with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had very little work during the party,
The scene was repeated in the second part, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of credit.
For his part, Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up distracted by another liveston combination game.
Rangers dedicated himself to hanging out and another pilot in the Livingston area, just to be rejected, and they were charged with two fines, one for a supposed entry from Halkett to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and the other for hands.
Livingstone "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to surpass all expectations in this ascending journey.
His game style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the highest category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, in the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worall had to be hanging from Menga all over the party.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Even though the brilliant moments with Gerard as a coach have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly exceeded the local defense), and this Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Extraordinary reception for Erdogan in Colonia
They were all smiling and clear on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Colonia to open up a new giant mosque.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
The police set up security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard while both Erdogan politicians and the German government decided to welcome the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called dictators by others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: A cyclist dies meeting a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the Beswood Street and Evelyn Street street, a heavily trafficked area in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the medical services took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident takes place months after another cyclist dies in a case of escape bombing at Children Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
The metropolitan police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the nearest relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations for bus routes have been applied. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents injured in an Altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security prison center, according to the centre's office.
The facts occurred in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still missing.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to end the altercation, where eight prisoners were seen involved. The avalot could be held by a band.
The agents had to be alerted for slight injuries to the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We have deployed special prison personnel trained to try to solve an incident that occurred in Long Martin's prison, which still persists.
Six employees have had to be alert to injuries.
We're not going to tolerate the violence in our prisons.
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison had to be at a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, the anti-aircraft agents reported presence in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which center staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (the areas with even might be benefited)
It's not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that comes when what's left of the redhead passes through the south-west desert, with the consequent risk of rivers.
National Weather Service has already issued alerts for rivers for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and that Monday night will be near.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a piddle that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression on a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the border with Arizona."
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Centre include 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they would be recorded up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockets and the Great Conca, could record between 25 and 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk from floods, the rain of the Rose could become a very good news, since the region suffers a severe drought.
Although laughs are a serious cause of concern, some of the precipitation could be very beneficial, as the south-west region is currently suffering a drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first of all, the Rosa Hurricane will play land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have a hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes you lose strength.
So it's expected to hit land in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitation in various parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of floods.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with a tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona in the first hour of Tuesday's morning with a tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and get to the south of Utah well entered on Tuesday night.
"The main risk we're expecting from the Rose or what's left of it is very high precipitation in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the south-west desert of the USA," according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and streams of waste in the deserts, in addition to land-enslavement in mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshots in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00 on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he's stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call because any person who can have any kind of record of the facts with the mobile phone gets in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the misery and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection of the ruthless and infamous tactics of the democratic party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "painted the messiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress on Thursday, denying thoroughly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had been sexually abused for decades when both were teenagers.
Ford also stated in the view in relation to his annex.
The president said on Saturday that that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and bravery."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an amazing service path in citizenship," commented the multitudes of supporters of West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment as referring to the importance of the participation index of Republican voters in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our big candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to "resistance and obstruction".
It is hoped that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment will take place as late as Friday, according to CNN, an assistant of the Republican party leaders.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that were crashing against the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast in the afternoon, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat for tsunamis came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and they didn't run right away, so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, bringing the BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency into a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
Some people went up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency where the amount of destroyed shops and buildings, turned bridges and wells is appreciated and a mixture of water surrounded.
Replicas continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the intense Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped between the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were extradited.
According to Nugroho, the death and damage could increase at the coast to about 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross commented in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, which could unfortunately end up much worse," he said.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday not to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the alert was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social networks, it can be felt as a man on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to people on the road about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall bursts into the edge of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not authenticate immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut of electricity supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuations continue to need food desperately, as well as other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths by Indonesia's tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Dongala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where employees flock to remote shelters located in the courtyard of their office, during the trip they had to present scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's a disaster.
Although the relief groups made the deplorable gesture of initiating the relief work, some complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, the provision and the provision of foreign personnel can only begin to fluctuate if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Red Cross.
"When the government says "Well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While burning the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people kept the hope of the miracle and their loved ones eluded the devastating account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a trap.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the trench for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national Indonesian parapent team, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
"As senior to the parachute, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapentist community, he had desperately sent messages by WhatsApp to Palu's competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received," he added.
Stealing is $26,750 during the completion of an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an automatic cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated to the communiqué that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the automatic boxer in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "was running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the report, the witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about his identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed its name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper is renamed Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
A long time ago, in West, 41, he was motivated by the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, which is expected to present its new album, called Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the programme's author.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West at the beginning of this year, talking about his album's title with the Big Boy radio shower.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've been through Kanye, which means the only one, just yes, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of what we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without script and in capitals.
Mexico President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when the country lacks enough to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a cruel rebate against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "military force would never be used again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when left student movements were rooting across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador, who has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the arrest and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funds allocated to the IA
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investment and professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the North American Government have announced measures in the field of IA, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in IA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 of the world in terms of innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicateing the IA research budget would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are far behind the United States and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the IA field," Lee pointed out.
"Duplicate funding could duplicate opportunities for the US to launch the next great discovery in IA," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that surpassed the U.S. player in Othello with the best ranking and later exercised as executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee positively evaluated previous technological competitions of the North American Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"Sometimes North American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted university eminences to work in the field of IA.
Lee commented that the task of the US in the field of IA could also be seen driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think permanent residence cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the China State Council presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other US public bodies give money to North American researchers, but the quality of academic work is less than China," Lee said.
Early in the year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA has announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the Natural Sciences Foundation, more than USD 100 million is currently being spent in research in IA.
In the meantime, months ago, no action in relation to North American legislation was being taken to set up a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed decades ago with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim from its territory and has vetoed NATO and the EU's entry.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign doubts whether he will reach the minimum required participation of 50% so that the referendum is valid.
The question mentioned in the paper of the referendum is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the agreement with Greece?".
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created to end the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the country's future, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that they will achieve the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia's referendum on the country's change of name, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of tents installed by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the high head, not through the back door," Kavadarkov explained.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can appeal to other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO integration will be accompanied by more investment than you would need in Macedonia, which has an arrest rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev said that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum participation required.
According to the results of another survey, led by Macedonia's Telma TV chain, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would mean the first hard for the policy of the West Government since it took place last May.
Look at the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, makes a goal after running all of Brighton's defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory for 2 to 0 in the match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left quickly between the three Brighton defenses, tearing out what he was walking through the playing field with.
Later, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He ran a defense before he crossed a few more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he made a pass on his left that he found Sterling.
The English fronter returned the pilot to the first touch, inside the area, in Aguero, which with his right leg struck the porter of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a right that stuck inside the net on the right side.
"Aguero has foot injuries," Pep Guardiola, city coach, told reporters.
"We have decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that a goal has been marked at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the fight for the First League.
His goal was 29 minutes away.
At that game, Aguero received the pilot deep into Brighton's field and
He made a beautiful passage into space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before moving her to Sterling in the long suit.
Sky Blues front ended the pilot inside the network before he got off the background line.
The city is facing Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the group phase of the Champions League at 18:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the fight for play-off, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to go out to the launcher's mountain Sunday that he will come against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who keep an advantage party on Los Angeles Dodgers at the National Western League, have opportunities to play the playoff.
The Rockies made sure they had a comedy with the victory for 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they were still trying to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can get out of the environment here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but apparently they are determined to let Scherzer launch if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, made a Friday heating session and would launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing launcher has an 18-7 record with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike removals in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump has a meeting in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is in play in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
That's one of the big, big... I don't introduce myself, but actually I do.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, it's happening right now.
They're determined to regain power by all means necessary, see their mesquiness, their evil intent.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control.
The democratic mission, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he exclaimed, and he called the Democrats "unscrupulous, mean, dirty and false."
Trump mentioned Diane Feinstein, the high-ranking democratic senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, as he caused a strong public protest.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... that was a very bad expression of body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Party has ceased to be a different party.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, everything to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because he was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the censorship motion, I was criticized for discriminating with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, is ironically similar to that of which Jeremy was discriminating with previous leaders.
In the wake of the Nottingham Laborist Party's Friday meeting, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local labor MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday evenings have been exactly the same.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and for a long time the promise of "more generous and kind" politicians has been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Laborist Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since colleagues who previously thought he was sharing a political vision seemed to expect me to turn 180th and take positions that he would never have taken, either on national security or on the single EU market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages that are being called because my candidacy is not being renewed, central politics is being denounced and I'm told it shouldn't be at the Labor Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they don't quit.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laborist Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're not that different party anymore, and with every movement of "untrustworthy" or every change in the selection rules, the party got further shaken.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and have been recommended that I keep my head down, that it wasn’t so expressive and that “everything would be fine. ”
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Laborist Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, stimulated by thatcher's negligent government, who left my whole class literally sunk, I've tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, I would say that at a time when the country is walking to a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to transmit did not lead to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are laborists or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of renewal of my candidacy or political interest will prevent him from acting, in my opinion, in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr hittts lead the leader
Two last-hour attempts distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that the Airs deserved the victory in this vibrant Tennant's Premiership Day party.
The Ayrs, who are the only team in the hands of ten, take the first position on the ranking table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that he knew how to take better advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still being beaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Glorious for the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the better opportunities than we have."
Grant Anderson's attempt at minute 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put before the Airs, but a yellow card for the international Scottish Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted attempt.
The climate extended the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just in the middle, it noted and converted an attempt to place the mark 17-5 in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melroses well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, who withdrew to bed, and in the arrest the Airs again expanded the distance with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Next, the full Captain Blair Macpherson was ammonated with a yellow card and, again, Melrose took advantage of the superiority of a more man with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted, and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a parking position in the airlock without a pilot, MacPherson noted a counterattack behind Air's spring.
The climate marked, as it had done almost again since the arrest, after Kyle Rowe picked up a David Armstrong jute and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to note the fifth attempt by the local team.
The Still Game series star seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to move into the hostel sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor interprets Jack Jarvis' character in the popular BBC series, which writes and co-protagonizes Greg Hemphil, his comic partner for a long time.
The two announced that the ninth season would be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the respect, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flooring sector".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coast, expects the court to reopen its path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol for their ship covered with hail in La Paz.
Public buildings are flagging a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are emphatically emphatically: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Beyond Bolivia's coastless territory, the record of a lost coast before Chile in a 19th-century conflict of resources remains very vivid, as is the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects a resolution issued by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, not necessarily, expects with a positive attitude the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution in large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will say in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for the next year's reelection, also has many hopes deposited in the Monday resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the final submissions, indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from looking forward to it, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has seized the issue of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
"The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill by Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not been exchanging ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrimination, with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume the stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a quemera to think that the US's continued sanctions and objection to a declaration that will end the Korean War can make North Korea bow down.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament movements.
Both Kim and the president. North American Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's serious issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the latest range of large-scale hats, from the road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's designers presented a range of extravagance covers of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which removed the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been torn down by very few practical hats, and this designer has brought his amazing creations to the pass.
Valentino's prominent piece was an exaggerated bee hat, decorated with a wide wing, in the shape of a lead, that flooded the head of the models.
Among other sized accessories, there were jewelry, a magic hat and, even, a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extravagant masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, live colors, had sharp lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not high.
One creation resembled a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a cone of ice.
And if you follow the great trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that huge hats could be placed on the main streets near you.
Large-sized hats trap the "Bomb", a ball hat, with a two-foot wide wing, that everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so little practical that it spread across social networks brought another great creation to the passageway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in a bathrobe that it was carrying.
The Rafia bag, dark orange, decorated with rafia locks and finished with a white leather nose, was the prominent piece of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacques in the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a course of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are working to provide a better level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher and higher education, for their chosen career and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you'll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages obtained a grade A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students received a higher A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an election assignment, are kept in the same consideration as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the United Kingdom's Employment and Skills Commission revealed that for reasons given by entrepreneurs to cover vacancies, 17% were attributed to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more opportunities for potential work that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like that.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouTube among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% didn't speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Knowing a variety of languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools as to the languages they learn.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your son's interest, he'll always be able to choose from a series of languages in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global trading environment of today, languages cannot be denied that they continue to be vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will start with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
Hope's almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first time match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But they still have to determine the minutes they'll play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said in the Lakers' official place.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James is probably gonna play for a few minutes.
After the beginning of this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the timing of the Lakers' six pre-term games.
"I don't need pre-term games at this stage of my career to be ready," he insisted.
Trump meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaign acts tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five scheduled meetings next week, which include visits to sympathetic places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacancy is pending, Trump claims to have support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump meeting in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video broadcasts on YouTube.
Trump is likely to abort the hearing launched this week with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense about the allegations of sexual abuse he was facing, while the Senate's scheduled vote of confirmation remained pending for up to one week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans present in the delicate elections in November to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading for a busy campaign season," said a Trump spokesman who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
This evening's meeting, programmed at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together sympathizers "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting some unfavorable results in the investigations.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him the impetus in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows its ambition to keep the hopes alive in the face of individual Sunday parties
After three unequal sessions, the Saturday throughnoon in the afternoon was probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculating pendulum of dynamics is an inventive sport concept in which players actually cross, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're on a little positive track," Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is a little bit in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is giving examples.
The gutular cheers of the celebration went up as he continued his turn and became a crucial whore to impound the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been down two after two holes.
He celebrated the whore that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar scream, which indicates that he thinks the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party," Spieth said.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple carry four to four and don't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a guess Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the guess Saturday mornings and Friday afternoons, and the last nine holes Friday mornings.
As a result, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from public boulders, it is confirmed that they are the best players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Mostly both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who married Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sunk Spanish and Swedish into a hole of which they never had a choice.
Sunday, but there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The furballs and fursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have been questioned.
Europe at the end of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 mark
Europe will face Ryder Cup's last day with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and the Saturday fairs with a win for 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, until now, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy that he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a little American team in the morning's four-balls and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to fursomes and won two parties, but they could not reduce differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points at 12 individual Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs, they staged a brilliant action to blow a Woods deflator and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic genius spores, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning football, remarried with Henrik Stenson at the fairsomes and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all face-to-face on a pleasant and windy day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times a tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set up a reference point for the Americans on Saturday, reaching two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and later they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy again for 4 to 3 at the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's story a team had raised a four-point difference to individual parties, although the Furyk team, the title defender, just needs to fold to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack Sunday is coming out of its range.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmed if trust signs are not appreciated
North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions were intensifying his mistrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant voluntary measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing themselves to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't notice any response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
Although Ri resumed the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-phase denuclearisation approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually took action, its statements seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral full denuclearisation, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement that Kim Jong One and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a US president and a North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim committed himself to working on the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally put an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that it must eliminate its nuclear weapons before Pyongyang.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that nuclear disarmament must first take place and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "final declaration of war," Ri pointed out.
"The perception that sanctions will make us bow down is a joke of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party involved in the issue of nuclearization was South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation."
However, Ri's tone of speech was very different from what he kept last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that pointing to the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
The United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but showed that there is still much to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The application of Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and final denuclearisation."
The Security Council has launched sanctions in North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut the funding of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying they had made progress, but in a few hours North Korea accused him of making "his own demands of a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consonance measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "consonance measures" he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised to Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
Enguany, a new course at Harvard University has allowed her students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly extended, to study all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic observed that students at the number one university in the world are often disappointed with the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after talking about the impact that noise deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the conversation, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are they telling me all this in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sound, which surprised me," The Telegraph reported.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told the basic concepts of how good sound habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after he learned that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, from an hour to an hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there's an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee rates, curtains, bamboos and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance in the lack of sound, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily path.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects on the health of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer make sound deprivation an increasingly big problem.
To make sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid weight gain, as the deprivation of sound puts the brain in an iniquitous way and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year's first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to conduct a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students take into account the fact of alarming when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the rhythm around and cause sound problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga ends with the men of Gerard
Dolly Menga's goal is to condemn Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston house that assumes another ambush outside.
Ibrox's team tried to add their first victory to home from the triumph of the past February 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked the second defeat at Gerard in 18 matches as a coach to leave their team on the draw, at 8 points from the Hearts, irreparable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equalize the marker.
While the Rangers now fall in the sixth square, the Livingston is in third position, behind the Hibernian because of different goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, because the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that was apparently launched from grace.
Gerrard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that trashed the Ayrs at the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven headline he set up a point against the Hearts last week.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should have marked in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the uncampaigner leaned aside and took the great opportunity.
A massive miss release by Keaghan Jacobs met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow only made a court turned upside down.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than they believed in their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute signal, since he and Steven Lawless met, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two judges to the front door, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and the archbishop Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livis in 34 minutes could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted on the break by changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had an immediate impact, since the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the blockade.
However, the Livingstons continued to catch the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long walks, one after the other.
Holt's band could have given up direction in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow did a deviating justice from the roots.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his eyes big.
Almac: Geiger Count Inventor
And now a page of Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day when the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally led to the device we know as Geiger counter.
Count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starred by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently a failed professional.
Man: "What's in front of this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger count, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that come from the radioactive activity in the minerals."
Evans: "Surely he's blowing up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can see a common protein in many cancers and then reinject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the disappearance of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 protein "favours the growth of various types of cancer", including that of mom, ovary, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach is to extract immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got stuck in a pro-Trump diatrotype with a MAGA hat after his performance at the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written in the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic event in which US President Donald Trump congratulated and said it would be presented in the 2020 elections.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, in which he carried a hat from Make America Great Again, he began criticizing the Democrats and repeating his support in Trump.
"When I talk to white people they say to me, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee for allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock picked up West's dissatisfaction recording on social networks.
It wasn't clear if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West complained to the public that it was not well treated among builders because of the hat she was wearing.
"I was threatened by builders.
They told me not to go out with that hat.
I was ambushed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said he would put Superman's layer on because they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the audience's writings at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who explained in the publication: "The whole study remained completely mute."
West was acting as a last-hour replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a lot of the audience perplexing with the interpretation of song I Love it, dressed in Perrier's bottle.
West won the support of the captain of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for staying out of the crowd."
But the debate show presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "being who it is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or by supporting their art) who I think adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed and that it was now "the first known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, before he was called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name for a symbol and later the artist previously known as Prince.
Temptation murder charge for torture at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man's beating in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The prosecution is expected to appear before the court of Belfast's first instance on Monday.
The prosecutor's gonna check the charges.
The star of a throne game, Kit Harington, reports a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of spy Jon Snow in the series of violent medieval fantasy of HBO Thrones Game.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of male hero, claiming that these papers imply that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he was wondering how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married the co-protagonist of the Thrones Game, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she is very determined to deal with this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we are wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?"
According to Kit, television can be part of the responsibility of increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so virile characters.
He added, "What's innate and what's acquired?
What do you teach on television and on the streets that make young boys feel they have to have this face of manliness?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because there's no doubt something wrong with the young boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequeues or sequels of the Throne game when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he is full of battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will stage a position of work True West by Sam Shepard, who explains the story of a cinematographic producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his partner Rose is the best thing that has provided her with a Throne Game.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose played Ygritte's role, the love of the character that Kit, Jon Snow, represented in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only the second quarter of 2018 40,000 new cases were declared.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV for this cause has been reduced almost to zero, according to Chinese health officials' statements at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in the LGBT community is common.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from senators of the Republican Party and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters filed on Saturday the accusations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three US republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that they were driven by requests by critics and websites of extreme right.
"Frequent lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
Apparently, the published information contained addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and published it to someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on complaints of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed the information of a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
"This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member, identity, personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this filtering of information.
This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation," Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
You have to keep the calm and the serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was present to overthrow Waters in mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"I don't care if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We'll make sure that the criminals are revealed, he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions that have been carried out and that they have damaged all and every member of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again: limited space parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new movie with a British focus, and this reposition of the frankness of Johnny English comedy parody, who was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how despicable we are will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the uncompromising eyeball and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to break everything, and his name indicates more than anything else that is a comic created for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to the cinema.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point from Mr. Bean and a touch from this guy who brings a single note to the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson traveler who now represented Barclaycard's forgotten television ads, where he looked like chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good times on this last J.E. trip.
I loved Johnny English, who was approached by a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the sheets of the helical were retraced in the helmet.
There's the gift that Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems pretty fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
humour seems to be aimed at children more than adults, and for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's confusion, a pitiful little paper for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who is a pretentious and obsessed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of her with this figure pressed by Teresa-May, but the script does not reach any more.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that, as each active spy is in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes the miserable Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but teaching extra-official classes about how to become a hidden agent, with some good gags, like now when English offers a espionage academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his follower Bough, a paper that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little underutilized.
So the Batman and the Robin of when things get very ugly in His Majesty's secret service they go into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of the technological billionaire charismatic that he claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the unfortunate Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hatred of ridiculous madness: they are dressed up in rooms, burn a French fast food restaurant, sow chaos by smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English causes great confusion in trying to use a helmet of virtual reality to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been pulled out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise that comes along, everything seems like a child program.
Pretty normal things.
Like Johnny English's other films, it's not been helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning a plan for British people to have a four-day working week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Apparently, the party wants the heads of companies to spend the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers giving them a more festive day.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they got the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea would match the economic agenda of the parties and the plans to bend the country in favour of the workers.
The four-day shift is supported by the Trade Union Congress union federation as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour Party source declared in The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labor Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labor Party does not support this ambition in a joint way at present.
According to a spokesman for the Labor Party: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The minister in shadow John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shade also imply that water company shareholders could not recover the entire investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees together in companies and create property funds included to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who expect to raise annual dividends for a value of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, explains to "60 minutes" if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, Scott Pelley's correspondent asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Speak it seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had.
He was firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I'd have an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it round," added Graham referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people he calls will be able to verify.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, which brings about an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of the event to end extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to fight it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless someone wants to pay a VIP entry), the assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other activity to raise awareness of the purpose of ending poverty.
What has Global Citizen achieved now that he has 12 years left to reach his goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just a more case than we call "clitivism" (people who think they mark the difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than USD 37,000 million, which would have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which $10,000 has already been disbursed or recovered at least.
The group estimates that the protected funds have now had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of investors and realists with them in the United Kingdom, which undertakes to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustices of malnutrition into a few pages of history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions that called for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It'll be a long and hard path, sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But as the great defence movements of civil rights and against previous apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at the event of shame in New York, who will present Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to obstruct Russian energy exports (secretary of the Interior)
Washington may, "if necessary", resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted as Washington Examiner.
Zinke has complained that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is their will to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern bank of Europe," he alleged.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to assistants to the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that self-defined as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of exploiting and replacing fuels," he said, while pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements arrive while Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its natural gas to Europe, in exchange for Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US president Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "inadequate" pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a Moscow "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11,000 million and will double the gas pipeline capacity of 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of disloyal competence.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak declared after a meeting with US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow on September.
The U.S. position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German sector, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to separate EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he will "think carefully" his presidential candidacy in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "think carefully" his candidacy for the presidency after the middle parliamentary elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and settle the government's fracture, for women to take up high office," said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take seriously my candidacy as president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed it should not be presented by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not appear, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The investigation revealed a broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other high profile names among the Democrats that were taken into account in connection with a possible candidate for 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision to the genre, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quoted the affection for TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after listing September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"With what is happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers are returning with," he explained to the public at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they return a little different, they return to endurance, they return wondering if there is respect for what their soldiers and pilots, as well as any other army member, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence to a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, who was brought to the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented a curiae friend in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request for the Grace vs Sessions case that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the member of the violent gang" attacked her, but the US officials denied his asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy withdrew a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the curiae friend.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrants' entry is damaging the US economy, as it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "supply jobs".
In June, general prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or a specific political opinion," Sessions said in their announcement of June 11th of this policy.
Asylum has never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is becoming more and more desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her son with fever in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined houses to take in flood-relateds and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and the hospitals, cursed by magnitude 7.5, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke his shoulder, are outside the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are treated out because of the strong saxades that are repeated.
The tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room of the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the town.
"I heard my wife asking for help crying and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "advertising ads."
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page advertisement in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily's payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most common newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of immigrating to the US Congress on November 6, U.S.A., of denying China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to immigrate to the US elections marked what North American officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensified trade war that has seen oranges supporting mutual imports.
China's vengeful tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and Iowa's former governor for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled by publishing advertisements to our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the estimated North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to place a payment ad in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In return, in the kiosk down here in Beijing, you will find little disconcerting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the opinions that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic journey, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "One of China's most prominent newspapers was missing the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before the middle parliamentary elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
Since many of the major Republicans support and defend the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces various requests for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the forthcoming mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high, and most Republicans have officially shown that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour's pressure to carry out an FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow, or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors called out "November is coming!" (November approaching) as they appeared in the Senate lobby while the Republicans under the control of the Judicial Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the witness of Ms. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain out of the chart," explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news station.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among the voters of women from the suburbs and younger voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault applications to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if the Republicans were to press confirmation.
"This has become an issue for the GOP," said Michael Steele, the Republican National Committee's representative, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, nor about Kavanaugh sitting at the accused's bank, but also about how the Republicans handled this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps choose Democrats, in the news channel.
However, the North Americans seem to be divided between those who cross the Ford star and Kavanaugh witnesses, with the balance that is slightly shifted to the last.
A new survey by YouTube shows that 41 percent of the polls cross the Ford's testimony in a certain or probable way, while 35 percent claim to believe in an unquestionable or probable way.
In addition, about 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or doubted during his witnessing, while about 30 percent claimed that ford himself.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating requests filed by Ford and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez reports that the candidate in the Supreme Court taught genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open code platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intention of Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the company emerging.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What is exclusive from the personal data store is that the user is who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's delegate advisor, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers contracted to work on the project and a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that none of his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied during the night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a Saturday's publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new web age," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the I GM Victory Cross
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honored in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Lieutenant Bernard Vann got the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was beaten by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandsons threw out a memorial stone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's preserved proselyte.
According to The London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and subways".
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage", made the line move forward before he threw himself over a cannon with one hand and left tuned three members of the stand.
Lieutenant Colonel was beaten by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prose that could never be equal, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is proved by the support he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed out all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and they deny you seeing the most important event.
San José's cartel contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the viewers of the United Kingdom were shocked when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset that they had been up late into the morning to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change in cartoons as "a sort of vomiting acuity".
"The government's legislation says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Marketing and Bellator's communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Puppa la cotta, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning on a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time on Monday.
But we're working there.
Believe me, when I switched channel, there were many messages that went and came, and not all were nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it ended.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to get sick.
Daley, who appeared as a shipwreck in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "he was not socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that gave me the power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, not to disappoint anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The world's tri-camping explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the North American realist Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 years older than he was, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you’re young, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who’s experienced high and low levels of cancer when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple were parents in June of a child they named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had entry to London in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell her," he said, "papa, you won't be there to take the first row," he said.
"As he held his hand, he stopped breathing and it was not until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and that he was still wearing his hair.
Desert Island Discs broadcast to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's worse was introduced to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
North American Phil Mickelson will beat a record Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become an unhappy tape.
Mickelson, who will participate in the two-year event to record for 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments shares his time between making animators and working on his game in the field, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He's never done the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National's difficult journey, where the long rough habit of punishing the distracted hits.
And if his own route isn't too discouraging, Mickelson, on Sunday's new game, will face the precise British Open, Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood's Roque to win the four matches this week.
If the North Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start strong, the Mickelson party could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, unable to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm on my back and surrounded me with his arm while he told me he was ready for the next day," Fury said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
It's a hall of fame and it's brought a lot to these teams earlier and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we should move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a career at Ryder Cup that didn't equal his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 empathies, although Furyk has said his presence has brought untraceable to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke about people and he's a big teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun staying with him this week, which was fun to see.
It brings much more on the side of your game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish began in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but eventually they won the victory for the least, 14.5-13.5.
"And you continue to remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 team's victory for 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the members of the team that's not finished yet.
He has to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This does not end until the bookmarks can be placed in the bookmark.
We have a goal, we try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already said, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also remember who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of their players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never rush with this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to deliver better individually than on team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both faces of the coin about last day's climbs, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing in the "Miracle de Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the head of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start on foot, as was seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the revolt against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I think it covers all the possibilities," says Bjorn about his selection for individual confrontations.
The new warship of Germany, repatriated
The new German Army fragment should have ended in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the year it comes from defective systems and an increase in costs, according to local media.
The completion of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class fragments, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships the Army launched in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class wreckage.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-abuse missiles, as well as technology against furtive actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other prominent features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use new fractals up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that pre-war ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the Bohm & Voss dresser in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
There are few details of the reasons why he came back, but the German media have quoted several "material and technical defects" from the ship that made him inservable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the old Bremen class fragments, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, because it reduces its performance and limits the Army's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as many class ships as the Germans used during the Second World War.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to be a problem.
It is believed that EUR 3,100 million (US$ 3,600 million) has arrived from an initial budget of EUR 2,200 million.
The problems of the new fractals have become a matter of special importance, given the recent warnings that the military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, has recognized that the Army is "remaining without ships that can be used".
The officer has said that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but none of them were provided again as replacements.
He lamented that none of the baden-Württemberg-class frogs could join the Army.
The National Foundation is spying on the secret life of the victims
A new investigation carried out at a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is about to discover how the rat population uses the landscape to feed themselves.
It is hoped that the discoveries can provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common, as well as northern and watery batons in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key property locations to monitor the activities of the bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at the National Foundation for Scotland, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are more important to the rat population and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of the habitat management work, such as the creation of dishes, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of locusts in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
Building and restoration tasks threaten the victims, as they affect the nests and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and light bulbs are also at risk, as are the killing paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, rats are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a catch.
They use a sophisticated location-by-eco technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously.
He has ten experts with appropriate training, who carry out surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes usually rescued.
Even the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to bats at Thrave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The finca's administrator, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Thrave, we have a great area for the rat," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all a good home.
But we still don't know many aspects of the harvest, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to grow."
It notes the importance of checking if there are delays before doing maintenance tasks in property, as the possible involuntary destruction of a single motherhood infant kills more than 400 women and young people, which could lead to the disappearance of a whole local population.
Rats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Preservation Foundation official, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about the rats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while his lawyers prepare a complaint against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that charges of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "want to make themselves famous" thanks to their name.
Their lawyers will request the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's predecessor and Juventus have been accused of violating a U.S. woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid $375.000 at the time because the incident didn't become public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live, where it was directed to its 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said it was "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the gold pilot's five-time winner in the camera.
"They want to become famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the claim against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have described as "inadmissible information of suspicions about private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anonymously, according to reports filed in Clark County Court.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy", except a "1%".
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she was "for revenge" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the deal, as she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to land for the King of Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he planted for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would always regret it," if you lost the world's lead in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota's base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without reaching an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cause job losses.
Burnaston's plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the United Kingdom comes out of the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused fears from other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it'll close the mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the Brexit production chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a "just in time" basis, with fish coming every 37 minutes from UK suppliers and the European Union for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and scarcity of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it should stop production as a consequence.
Clark says the Theresa May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We need to reach an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said BBC Radio Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota couldn't confirm how long production would be stopped, but in the long term, she warned that added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union on the ground, has said that members start to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never return."
A spokesman for the government said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The expected meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "stop for a week" while continuing the fight on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia and assistance in Trump and a possible obstruction to justice by the president.
Whether Trump was fired or not by the Deputy Attorney General and put Mueller's independence at risk, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record talks with Trump and also the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
A meeting with Trump, however, was announced for Thursday in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "I prefer not" to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee to which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the whole Senate's vote.
The Trump press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "It has not yet been fixed a date, it could be this week, although it may be that another week is due for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always like keeping the press informed."
Some journalists could refute this claim: Sanders hasn't had an informative session of the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not to please him with the fanfare of television journalists, although he said, "I won't deny they're fanfare."
Next, he implied that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders has said the briefing sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press is able to ask the president of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We often try to do this, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace the information sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he comes out of the White House or participates in open sessions or press rounds with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at some point, he's weird in front of the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers from the Scottish National Health Service raise fears about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter within six months of the UK's entry into the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of resident state applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and everything seems to be headed towards the decisions expected this afternoon.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in case of a possible unagreed scenario.
I know it's time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate my deep appreciation for the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and stress that strengthen and improve the health service task, while benefiting patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a rereligion of the Tennessee State Tigers, has undergone an emergency operation after suffering an injury on Saturday in defeat for 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, Tennesseen.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle.
"He came to the beach line and he went off there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before putting it on a bed and taking it to do more testing.
An officer from Tennessee State informed Chris Harris, WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it was fixed from Illinois.
I had completed five positions on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Hisenda hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
It is expected that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect the highest yields.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be spent on government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many well-being areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" and are taking away from the large number of foreign buyers that spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure arrives weeks after Boris Johnson has requested a reduction in stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping high the prices of the properties by quickly buying land and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on dry houses to correct Britain's real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on the rental and termination of "no blame".
He also wants to give more authority to congregations to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be as easy as it is for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies with them abroad, to buy housing compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home owned is too far away and the indignity of homeless people makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch has accepted the challenge of revising the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position at League One, at three points in the lead.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a supporter, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"But I grew up seeing a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was little and always is something that makes me backward in time.
This opportunity will only come if I'm successful in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training position include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's exterminator says he doesn't feel the pressure to be the next one in a list of names dedicated to such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town offers.
"From now on, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can get this team back to the First League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd just think I'd made it here if I could make it back to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the heart's technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed St. Mirren to fight for the salvation of champions of the Championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the position in the Alloa.
"I'd always thought training was what I was given better than playing.
It sounds weird because I did it right, I got out reasonably and I enjoyed quite good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I'm still doing this in ways like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, that's when the more comfortable I've heard from when I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave fired consumption at bars with difficulties in Britain, but added more pressure to restaurants' chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in July sales, but restaurant consumption has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from the CGA's financial assistant, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sun and England's participation in the world, which has been extended beyond expectations, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in the consumption of June restaurants has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, have achieved the best results, while restaurant consumption has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we've consulted, liquor sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, from Asia and hotel analysts at RSM, said: "These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to sales in the external steel market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% per annum would be particularly harmful, rather than constant cost pressure.
This long and warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the trades that serve food and time will say if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this breathing as much as necessary."
The total increase in bar and restaurant sales, including the recently opened ones, has been 2.7% on July, as it indicates the encouragement in the presentation of brands.
The The Coffer Peak Tracker sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the sector's established benchmark.
One out of five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents.
One out of five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown an increase in "Insta fake" pages
News has raised fears about publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that shows parents
One out of five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
News has increased the fear of publication of sexual content.
A 20% of students say they have a clean "principal" account that they show their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager who told others to "violcate me."
Research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many adolescents are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Federation of Athletics directive
Elid Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics directive at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with more Scottish medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from his dilatory international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid has respect for the community of Scottish athleticism, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have a lot of ambition to act as an athlete's voice, and I hope I can make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The U.S., who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympics and is currently the usual commentator of the BBC, was prevented from walking after an Ischemic transitional attack.
He wrote the following on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me if I could recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered everything, I've learned to walk again, and today it's about to be agile!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertisement that compares mothers with cows to share their views on the Internet
A shooting company has divided its Internet opinion with an ad that compares lactating mothers to mutilated cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent tirallet that can be carried from the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a musical video of jokes to show the freedom that gives the new tirallet to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a granary full of flour and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I love myself, but you won't see any tail" and "Because if you hadn't noticed, they're not funny, they're my tits."
The return continues: "Bombeja, bombeja, feed babies, bombeja, bombeja, hire girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions that it has seen, many of which claim to show the "horrors" of the lactic industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie tyrannlet is discreetly hidden in a lactating support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "Intelligiblely traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a mother's thyroid that they'll keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an off-site ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "delicious".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the tyrant made me feel just like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but it has to be taken as it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who fire guns (usually at their place of work or at the washroom and feel like they're cows.
It's not an announcement that I'm going to let or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've all danced with the shooter discreetly stuck to the supporters.
The concept that hides behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel like cows when they use the thyroid.
However, Elvie's thyroid is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a lactating holder, making women more free to move, subjecting babies and even getting out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a mother's first child development partner and developer, said: "The Elvie tyrant is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tyrant is used and the challenges he is supposed to do, while we demonstrated, entertainingly and didactically, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new tyrant.
It's not the first time Elvie's been on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the passageway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained has increased even though monthly entry across the border has practically remained stable, in part because the rhetorical toughness and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be accompanied.
Traditionally, most of the peasants were paperless immigrants, who were afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults living in their homes will have to send digital prints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Duane Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to accommodate unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"It is up to 80% of the people who have hosted or live at the home of a person who has hosted are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear before the court within a month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of being present, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports they've given to the system in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, the signs that a child is suffering will be ignored.
They have added that moving children to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mullem asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war has lasted for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced persons.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleansed the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has said that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for escaping "unreasonable" that make refugees want to stay away from them.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has clear "terminaries" and expressed the hope that military action will address jihadists, including combatants from the Al-Nusra Front, bound to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the United Nations, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way for elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably expect, the scandals and the process of dismissal ended with its presidency in a premature manner.
What would certainly be "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in maximum audience hours has doubled to CNN 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show, from MSNBC, has led cable television audiences of up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"People have been knocked out because they don't understand," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the "Designed Survivor" ABC series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", he has another theory.
Remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered me that because I made him laugh," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can meet together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a group of experts debate the use Bob Woodward has made of "private use" sources for his book Fair", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a piece of thick clothing like his pride", titled Washington Post) and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes me seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night it gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" on the change of characters and tour of Trump's program (to fight with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose any episodes because you're behind you.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and I was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was closed looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it would be some kind of joke, but it seems they were right."

Foreign money inflames the middle parliamentary elections in the more adjusted House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is an influx of cash in effect in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realisation of the congressional districts that two current members have to compete for the same place.
This recent redeployment of Pittsburgh's suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the place in another district after some special elections last spring.
Lamb is facing another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were reduced after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decrees to the genre that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a special election held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 different points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on the Salvadoran for its support in China, but withdraws them
Diplomatics observed that the Dominican and Panamanian Republic had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tight meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners took off the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to withdraw heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Naurut, spokesperson for the department this month.
However, only the possibility of punishing El Salvador, which received US aid of $140 million in 2017, was envisaged, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths for murder and arrest.
With the steps of the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from being addressed to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, because it ended effectively with any likelihood of sanctions for the Savior.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to it, according to the diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to their offices in Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson for the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also since the anonymity, corroborated the statements.
History Study
The next event could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in the public registers.
What is known is that Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be found reporting to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a party jury.
There are many circumstances, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor any of its European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a stand against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history flows over such inflection points and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing a number of inflation points at present.
What would happen if Trump awarded Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the man who controls the fate of the investigation on Mueller?
Rosenstein has been with the water on his neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was not fit for the job.
Rosenstein says the Times information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court all and the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, in particular, will we vote in the middle of parliament a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we don't get past these tests, democracy will start to run the risk.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, he emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light up the lights of Saturday on that table with evastic.

Graham Dorans, of the Rangers, face-to-face optimist against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers took Vienna's Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive match in the Royal City camp this month, would leave it in a good position to classify himself as the Group of the G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented unscrupulous Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until 2-2 against the Vila-real, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to achieve great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the game believing that we could get a valuable score and we got it out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out at the end, but, in general, the empathy was probably a fair result.
They were better at first, but we were better at the second.
On Thursday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it'll be a tough game because they brought a good result to the last match, but I'm sure we'll do everything and we'll get a good result with the support of the affair.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine and the boys enjoy it, the training's good.
I hope we can do everything we can, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women lose sound for fear of saving for retirement
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
About half of the polls at the national level say they've talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10% of the polls say he talked to the kids.
"People want some family to take care of them, but don't hesitate to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you communicate your wishes with sufficient anticipation.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, because these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: He can also help you to determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for your long-term care may include a long-term long-term insurance policy, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or an own insurance policy with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: Cut the step into legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to designate a trusted person who supervises your medical care and ensures that professionals fulfill your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary arrest for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget about the little details: Imagine that your old family has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Specify those details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also what doctors want to deal with," Martin said.

Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots of a compressed-air rifle while he was back home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in the "British Summer Time") as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His life is not in danger for the wounded, and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. It is expected that the number of deaths will rise.
As the communications are cut, the aid units have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area in the north of Palu near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important data about Palu and Dongala, in the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Celebes, located at the extreme of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regent that extends over 300 km north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
The regent, an administrative region less than one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami occurred in west Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire belt and it is often caused by earthquakes.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 - magnitude earthquake shook a populous area in Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to ten feet [10 m] that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pide Jaya’s recovery in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastating earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the fallen buildings.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourism island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's older son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges of aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a lady tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled her phone.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su's temporary detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured obligation of $500, according to KTUU.
He attended the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, safely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three Class A flaws, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B deficiency, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
It's not the first time criminal charges against Palin are registered.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His wife declared that she had given a blow to her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans to associate her child's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit Indonesia's Celebrates Island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks don't work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right on the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos at the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had met at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, probably used a Home Depot rental truck to launch an attack on a bicycle car from West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and to hit fighters and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and that "intendedly" caused serious personal injuries, according to the intention to request the death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both crimes could be put to death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-blame indictment that included eight murder charges for organised crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, as well as a crime of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required considerable "planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and degrading".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the South New York District brought a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to carry out spying actions for the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that they told the researchers that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room.
He's not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" with the charge's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a perpetual chain without possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of the parliament of the Conservative Party states that NIGEL FARAGE should be launched in Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party's conference.
UKIP's former leader said politicians should "sympathize with the pressure of the Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own members suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Prime Minister Peter Bone said on the way to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks was highlighted when the Union Conservatives presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is fighting to preserve his Chequers' commitment plan between Brexit supporters' attacks, Union and EU supporters.
Allies insist that they will be able to reach agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and press Eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave of Solihull that he wanted to break the Chequers compromise.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out,' he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must break the Chequers compromise."
To clarify its opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be ministerial.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay there is totally false."
Brexit's conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of reporters: "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"Chequers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, is unpopular among our party and our activists, who are the people who go out the street and get us to win a few elections.
Leave the Cheques compromise and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that meeting politicians need to feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the union supporters marched to Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small number of activists shook banners on the Brexit Conservatives after the group was launched this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canadian agreement plus, for the border without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate for president after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Democratic of Massachusetts spoke about its future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice-president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It was a speculative centre on the possibility of relaunching Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with representatives in the open format since Trump took over his post.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to present himself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect for death had been arrested at LSU Wayde Sims' basketball player's shooting on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department has announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dieteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man of the shooting.
Yes, 20 years old, he got a shot and died near the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims received a shot at the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday to the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to the East Baton Police Department.
Yes, a two-foot junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets the world title after the team's orders deliver him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valteri Bottas was standing in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would have an important role to play in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost ran out of Hamilton as he defended his position at the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his companion.
Vettel went into boxes before and left Hamilton running with the transit to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the boxing and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after some round action which caused the Ferrari pilot to leave the free inside with the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third corn.
Max Verstappen started at the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he went to the seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in a good position for much of his career, keeping his wheels in order to save time, move to Kimi Raikkonen, and move to fourth.
Finally, he entered the boxes at round 44, but he could not increase the pace at the next eight times, and Raikkonen was in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all week long and it was a real lord to whom they told me to let me pass.
The team has done a great job to have a u-do," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the candidate of sexual abuse to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness before the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate proved that people were "skinned, cruel and false".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last days, when you see anger, when you see people angry, angry, cruel, and lying," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the filtrations and they say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?" "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it." He added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and it was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtering was done in his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial displeased the President, who commented at the Saturday night's meeting: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to regain power by means of the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who gets hurt, who have to fall for power and control," said the President, according to the Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's defeat at the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return party 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained an advantage of two goals thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equalized the Dundee, and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third victory of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who just won Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in four minutes, at 3:35, from a Kendall McFaul's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial period of agitation, Sullivan again placed the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the Giants' advantage in the first break when he reached the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the match at the end of the second party and ensured the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from a plane crash
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after he died to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers will safely land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many replicas in the area and there are many people trapped between the runes in Palu.
However, despite the fact that his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport's tremendous control tower.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that flight Batik 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died at the hospital later.
An Air Navigation representative, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"That broke our heart," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster relief agency has reported that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been able to access," said Soupo Purwo Nugroho's representative.
The waves, with an altitude of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and shelters.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minorities have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross works against clockwork to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is a tragedy, but it could still get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now a man has disappeared after the crash in the lake
The airline that operated a plane that was going to crash into a Pacific island in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that they had not found a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane was trapped in the lake because the track was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the track up.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk down the belt with water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began shouting, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners working nearby to improve a mole also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sank about 30 metres inside the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in aerial accidents recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composed a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning lives a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness to the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to build the charges movement, 29 years old, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones that showed that Telllis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that it was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that he had only one week to get to know each other.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He erased it from his life," said Hale.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed to the jury during the same day.
The High Breed: What is the hip-hop conscious?
A hip-hop trio fills your music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, ensures that the hip-hop has separated itself from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and fashion the hip-hop conscious again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Commons, have experienced a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Superintendent asks for a goodbye couple after a "racist" message
A New York minor complained to a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrong-directed text message from the mother who protested because she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare demand with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, expressed concern that the new granddaughter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After seeing her puppies, a "comfort" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman said goodbye to Mrs. Maurice, alleging that the granddaughter who had resigned, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims compensation for compensation to the couple and asks for compensation of approximately USD 350 a day for work with six months' residence for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," he told the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they were racist alleging that Maurice's resignation was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife sent him something I didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said the husband, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in someone's hands with whom you've been chatting, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with an "extortion," said that his wife's wife had two months to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude," the investor added.
The legal case is still unsolved and the public opinion court has hurried to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers wouldn't identify themselves with a talking bear, according to a new card.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter: "It's hard to put herself in someone's place that the law for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small hairdresser, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of books was "adorable", after his death last year.
Describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and pretend that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a suspicious man," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when your son achieved something: you're proud, even if it's not yours.
I think that's how he considered Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
When they landed, they brought their daughter to Nica Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad called frequently to say that it was very serious and that they didn't expect it to go over," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I went to a call from Nad and he told me that he would die in the next two minutes and that he had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given her to keep her body bleeding were consuming and getting out of her system.
He had died before what he was expected to do, and that's how everything turned out.
I just had to sit down and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by relatives and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now in pain for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had the cat's head and the tears didn't stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her so much."
Pain data hang cards to prevent suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a galley bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to hear what I have to hear every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, resident in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could illuminate any room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark point."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly concerned that there's a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know there are people who can come to, who can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"Never said he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their presents and he looked them in the eye and nothing."
He said that his death meant a great trauma to them, but they had to work on it: "Open a hole in the family.
It's ruining us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future stands for a line while the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking (a research with a limited scope and a limited time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed by the death of the supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are missing for the mid-term elections of November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans fail to achieve good results, they will see weaknesses in the time of obtaining that the man who wants to leave the election arrives at the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as he was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to undo the coup and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean "cau" deserters count with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong- one came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 deserts occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in prices that people's traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, most North deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees and often repatriates them by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
Early in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed in general to work to get a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority of the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temperament is unable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that it was a "historic," said Pelosi in relation to his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Judicial Committee of the Senate Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excitedly, denied charges of sexual abuse by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes shouting and being speechless while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats and said the charges against him were "grossful and coordinated murder of a character" organised by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court, since he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reprehensible when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if he confirmed it, and if the Democrats reached the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he's not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosio said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the Columbia District Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions he could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he questioned whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
"It is not the time for a hysterical person to enter the Court with prejudice and hope that it seems wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diet: months and years of plenty of anger and can't take it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's common.
She continued... "She helped me very much a woman who was an executive somewhere who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and began to cry, saying to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I kept going.
It seemed brilliant to me."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a majority of men, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable anger, is a larger woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a bit) who took me from the cliff and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extra-marriage adventure in a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the career, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said to me as she laughed 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the career and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "White and seven dwarfs."
Because he was late for the campaign, he was delayed with the fundraising, so he promised he wouldn't get to the race if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so excited about the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and for targeting voters, instead of doing it to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he was speechless.
"You might have thought you had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reaction.
"I might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my tomb?
"Would you cry?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial escapes of the trade war between the US and China were disturbing, and although it does not seem that the war should end quickly, a distance can be beneficial to the countries in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued his first warning early this year when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new oranges that affect products worth USD 200,000 million. These oranges imply a tax on half of all the goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has counterattacked in the same way every time and recently raised the five to ten percent oranges for $60,000 million in American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be back in the future.
Making Washington's back is a matter of giving in to some demands, but publicly kneeling in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing played its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that started a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated," says Abigail Grace, a research associate in Asia's Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"At present, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people who live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's Selection Wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has achieved Ryder Cup in 2018 in defeating the North American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election won the crown again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, shot the water out at the hole par 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined on all his series and became one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 since he started the current tournament format in 1979.
US Jordan Spieth was set apart with a 5&4 by the less qualified player from the European Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
World's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
He'll have eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, become the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't cry, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy. I'm so glad I recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I was able to help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the link to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the North American Gulf Tiger Woods 2+1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of having won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a career record at Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 big winning titles and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American selection fought all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
North American captain Jim Furyk spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European election.
We've fought.
I'm taking my hat off Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There's something to get your hat off.
They defeated us."
