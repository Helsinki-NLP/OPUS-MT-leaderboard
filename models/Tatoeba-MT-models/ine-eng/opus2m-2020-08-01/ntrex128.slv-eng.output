The members of the Valais Congregation are concerned that they are “like Mupetkom”
Some members of the congregation are threatened by the proposal to appoint MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, etc.) as members of the Valiant Parliament.
This was due to the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valijan Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Laburist Congregation said that they were concerned about their group, “because the name rhyme with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in the twp suitcase it means crap, and pwp kakata.
A member of the Plaid Cymru meeting said that their group as a whole “not satisfied”, and suggested other options.
The Valiant Conservative said that his ‘open spirit’ group was about to change the name while warning that there was a small difference between the words MWP and Muppet in the statement.
In this context, the word ‘w’ is similar to the word ‘u’ in the Yorkshire order.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing a draft legislation for the presentation of amendments to the name, said: 'The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be taken by members themselves'.
By law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Valiant Assembly was given the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valijan Parliament.
For members of the meeting, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but has received the most support in public consultation with the option ‘MWP’.
Members of the congregation are obviously proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who will have to present a draft amending legislation within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes in the way the congregation operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the functions of its members and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the congregation will participate in the legislative debate in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether they will change the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia’.
By voting, they want to resolve a long dispute for decades with Greece's neighbour, whose province is called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed her application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the president of the Zoran Zaev government, argue that the change in the name is the price they have to pay for joining the EU and Nata.
The bells in St. Martin’s Church have been silenced because the churches in Harlem are facing problems
“The older people I spoke to say that sometimes there were bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today no one else.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are hanging out differently today.
At least the living room is no longer a neighborhood where people start regularly."
However, he is concerned that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and that they will be back soon at the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominium) where people who would not help shelter in the remaining neighborhoods will live.
“A great majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and that is why the day will come soon when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that people who will move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built the Belgian religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s ten years later.
The first White Methodist Church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that was doing God - fearing work nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of the honorable John Howard Johnson, who was on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who did not want to hire or support blacksmiths.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the mayors planned to rebuild Johnson’s father, they ordered bells for the arrest.
Honoring David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s church, proudly called the bells "the bells for poor people".
The expert who arrested them in July referred to them in a slightly different way: "cultural foundation" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also stressed that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-headed musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was attacking larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced in St. Martin’s church.
In the church of St. Martin’s in the past few months, a complicated story has taken place with architects and contractors; some have brought church times, and others have the bishops.
Zakristija – the administrative body of the parish, made up of time – wrote to the bishop in July that she was concerned that the bishop would "try to transfer costs" to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some parishioners complained about transparency on the part of the bishop.
Sea dog injured 13-year-olds during hunting lobsters in California
Officials report that in California on Saturday, a sea dog attacked and injured 13-year-olds during the hunting of lobsters during the opening of the hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beach Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the TV KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning about half an hour he drowned with his friends when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then with the group he swam to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster, and then he found out that he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!'
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed he had a broken entire key.
"I have every one of you to go out of the water: "There is a sea dog in the water!" he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of sea dog responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier, a shark was observed in this area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of the body.
Responsible for 48 hours they have disabled access from the beach Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach Swami’s in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sea dogs in this area, but the majority are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with beautiful corners, as they have in beehives, and with professional staff.
As part of the entry into the British beauty market, worth GBP 2.8 billion and still growing, while the sale of clothing and household appliances falls, larger beauties will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the next year in more shops if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beautiful products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the fields previously used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s they say they will double the offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brand offer will also get more space in areas with trademarks similar to those in shops such as Boots.
Supermarket also revitalizes its boutique range of cosmetic products, so that most vegan products – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s shops. The first week opened in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to the online purchase and daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores would be similar to supermarkets, since the supermarket chain is trying to combat Aldi and Lidl discounts with several services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s group has opened outlets Argos in more than a hundred shops and also Habitat trades since it bought both chains two years ago, which has increased food sales, and the acquisitions have been more profitable.
The past attempts of the supermarket to renew their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have failed.
Sainsbury’s was a joint venture with the Chain Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but the bond ended after the dispute over the distribution of drug profits in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 shops to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy three years ago.
They announced that Lloyds would play its part in this plan, as they should expand the range of luxury brands for leather, including the brands La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We changed the appearance and impression of our beautiful corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available for advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, attractive environments and manual locations, and it means that we are now an interesting beautiful destination that is a challenge for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is “serious” because Holly Willoughby has withdrawn 11 million pounds from work.
The star plays Dragons Den (Good Business) angry because the TV leader Holly Willoughby withdrew from work worth 11 million pounds with his brand of life-style to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand clothes and Truly accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The director of this morning's show, 37, announced on Instagram that he was moving away.
Holly Willoughby got mad at the Dragons Den Petra Jones show, as she recently withdrew from her lucrative business with a trademark of life-style to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The Viri say Jones was “infuriated” when a golden girl on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that due to her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – there was no time enough to dedicate their brand clothes and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted that it would double its assets estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he left the trademark of True, Jones fled from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source says: "Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
It would be her long-term future to survive the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely surprised all the involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the opening was so close.
At the Marlow company’s headquarters, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale.’
Experts believe that this morning’s show, which is among the most interesting links for banks in Britain, would be the company’s number of millions due to large investments in products, from sheets and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were a good friend of ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Cappova in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president.
The couple have been together on holiday, and Jones also has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity’s I’m.
The source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the media's criticism of the comment, which some feel to be 'unpresiduous', and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up like that?
Trump said with his gruesome 'newsman' voice:
"I didn't give up anything."
He pointed out that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Her first meeting in Singapore in June marked a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leader at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the "response" of the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He pointed out that instead of this, the US continues to impose sanctions that continue to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his argument.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought positive results – they had stopped testing missiles, helped free hostages and brought home the dead remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach to the conversation about the relationship with Kim.
"It can be very Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this crowded theater, we have 200 people standing here," Trump said and showed the crowd directly in front of him.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island, more than a hundred dead
For example, when removing the consequences of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok have been displaced, natural disasters have not been declared, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“In many cases it was very clear that they did not require international aid, so the situation was somewhat complicated,” Sumbungov said.
The Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pala, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can help on the ground.
On Saturday, the representative of the National Disaster Agency, he said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau and ascertaining whether they would be allowed to help international agencies.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the country remains completely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In Asia, shelters were built after tsunamis, but on the other hand, this is not a common practice.
The obvious absence of a warning siren for the tsunamis in Palu was likely contributing to the loss of life, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at best.
Because of natural disasters, logistics is even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombok, is heading toward Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure ahead of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Joko administration in re-election next year.
Joko also faces the pressure of long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and more than 10,000 were evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim armies fought on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See for yourself: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge won the late equation against Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London, with a hit in 89 minutes, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the 1st English League.
Sturridge has accepted to give Xherdan Shaqiri 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal while remaining on his 1-0 team.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the remote neck.
The arrow traveled high above the penal space towards the upper right corner of the neck.
The ball finally came down through the door of the Kepe Arrizabalage and fell into the goal.
“I just tried to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always pull it forward as much as I can, so I just tried to get as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that Kante was coming, so after one touch I didn’t think enough and just decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at half an hour with the hit by Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this action, the Blue Attacker gave the fifth ball back to Mate Kovacic and flew into Liverpool's half.
He put the suitcase in the middle quickly and ran ahead.
Then he gave it up nicely through the defense, and Hazard ran into the prison.
Hazard rushed his defense and shot his left foot against the remote door through the Liverpool door of Alsson Becker.
Liverpool will meet with Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, in the group part of the League of Champions.
Chelsea is waiting for Videoton at the League of Europe on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of fatalities and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, the state accident agency reported on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sotopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that there were many people due to the Friday earthquake of 7.5, which triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of the buildings.
A palm with more than 380,000 inhabitants is a dam with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for a murder charge after a woman was stabbed to death
The police launched a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead this morning.
The 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7.55 in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and arrested a 32-year-old man for murder.
The police are calling on everyone in the area who saw or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I invite everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about getting in touch with us.
I also call on all, in particular, taxi drivers who may have caught something from the camera to get in touch with us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman was Birkenhead, and they found the body inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the crime scene and asked where they found her this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the cops are informing their women.
The cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he was speechless.
The residents were now told that it could take more hours before they could reenter.
The police heard him explain to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
It goes on to say "it's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and another one outside.
A number of policemen stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
All those who have any information request that they write to @MerPolCC call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter the journal 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memorial target for the "re-write of history" dispute
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical followers of puritanism.
However, Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal "insanety" and "an attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the West Minister’s palace will become a target.”
The iconoclastism in the English Civil Wars Cromwell did not order or execute.
Maybe he'll be the victim of the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor from the last century.
The brilliant presentation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a 19th - century opinion and is part of a historical narrative for a personality that some believe is still worthy of celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell’s numerous (maybe more in the late 19th century than today) are seen as the protector of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of continuous historical discussions.
Clearly, the dispute in the middle of the 17th century formed further development of our people, and Cromwell is recognized as an individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord's protector also deserve celebration and remembrance."
Killer pig from the Chinese farm to death
After reporting local media, a Chinese pig attacked and killed a farmer on the market in the southwest of China.
A man who was identified only with the name 'Yuan' was found dead with a cut artery and covered with blood near a pig at a market in Liupanshu in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday in South China Morning Post.
Pigs are prepared for pigs vaccination at the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
After reporting, she and her brothers were to travel from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was opened.
He said there was a big pig in the pighouse with a bloody pig.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig had bled the farm to death.
“Brother’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousins quoted as “Wu” in the magazine Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was closed so that he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police were collecting evidence on the scene.
The Yuan family and market leader were to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs ’ attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and a man suffered serious bodily harm.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a suitcase farm by the tractor, but then the woman took the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farm from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the blood taste can work as a "sweet".
"We'd just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
They just need to show enough respect," he said.
South-west U.S.A. for the remains of the Orcana Rosa comes strong rain
The Orkan Rosa is said to be moving against the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weak.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring the floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
From 5 a.m. to 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa is category 1 hurricane with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific Ocean, the area of low air pressure is strengthened, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach Baja California as a tropical storm and will push a high tropical humidity toward the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rose will bring up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in the parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture that will mix with the low air pressure area will produce abundant rainfall in the coming days in the wider southwest area.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of land use in the desert.
Due to high tropical moisture, the amount of rainfall in some places will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest parts, especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of rainfall is expected.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of the situation due to the widespread nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very thoughtless to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Strong rains can turn canyons into baby rivers and storms will bring local wind and dust into the air.
The approaching area of low air pressure will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible to fall over 12 mm, which may lead to a lower drop in flooding and slag roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical areas will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoon and Monday morning, late Monday and Tuesday evening.
A strong rain will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will also take place on Wednesday.
In the United States in October, large temperature fluctuations can occur as the Arctic cools and tropical areas remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
The week is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there are 20 different degrees.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to set up and expand again.
Most Central and Eastern USA will enter the warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the north.
In New York we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's interview
More than 20 million people on six television networks have seen an interesting Thursday's testimony by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault, which was due in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stance continued, as television stations had interrupted the regular program due to Friday's reversion in the last minute: the agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Fordova told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had left her in a guilty state and tried to seduce her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his burn testimony that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that Friday's testimony should be viewed by more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted the average viewing of television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that played witness, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the damage of the viewers who watch the program in the offices.
To make it easier to play, visibility is similar to that when playing a soccer game final or awarding the American Film Academy.
The TV Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In the second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
The interest was also high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in Friday's drama.
After the mayor’s office announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanough, CNN and CBS recorded on Friday morning television cameras and protestors shouting at him when he tried to get into the elevator to attend a hearing of the Justice Committee.
In a few minutes' time, he took a look at what caught CNN's television camera alive.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said some woman.
"You think he's telling the truth to the state?
You have power while many women are sick."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and he added that he would talk more about the committee's hearing and then the door was shut.
All television networks were also broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of the Cavanaugh nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, to which the minority party of Democrats called.
Flakea was partly convinced of this by talking to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was determined because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes for the appointment of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump initiated an investigation by the United States Federal Research Office (FBI) of charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of playing political games in Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, criticizing her plans for leaving the European Union, accused her of playing political games with the British future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's arrival at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In a further interview with her on the cover of the magazine, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit Plan and said it was a proposal that Britain and the EU pay the duties of another "very absurd".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of death by the LSU team
Police arrested a suspect in a fateful shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team.
After reporting to the Baron Rouge police, 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for charges of murder at the second level.
Officials posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police indicated that during Sims' fight he lost his sunglasses.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB's television reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police made a statement that he confessed he shot Wayde until he died.
Security is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
On Friday, an observer from East Baton Rouge Parish issued a previous report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The police are grateful for the special units for assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest, for the Louisian State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police and the residents of the area.
The sports director of the LSU Joe Alleva team thanked the local authorities for their "care and search for rights".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played a basketball for LSU.
The previous season, on average, collected 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, the LSU Will Wade team coach said that the team was "sudden" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"That's what you care about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano of ashes in Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes, which the Volcano Popocatepetl blasted, reached the southern neighbours of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as the activity in the crater was strengthened and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre has observed several cases of thunderstorms and earthquakes.
The pictures on the social networks showed thin layers of ashes that covered the windshields of cars in the vicinity of the capital city of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake in September 2017 hit central Mexico.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters who supported independence were confronted with anti-exposure police units and thousands of people joined the rival demonstration that marked the first anniversary of the Catalan polarized vote on kidnapping.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, which were kept by anti-cold police units, surrounded them with eggs and metal in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also battles, where policemen had to use their pendulums to stop the clashes.
The supporters of independence, who have been calling for several hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness”, faced Protestants who supported unity and shouted “Let’s live Spain!”.
As reported by local media, fourteen people in protests have suffered easier injuries.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was marked as illegal in Madrid, the Catalan separatists celebrated it, the tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, since the opposition to the separation had largely boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after police in violent conflicts tried to stop the vote at the polls in the region.
Groups supporting independence camped overnight in front of the polls to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another path.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents crying for happiness because they could, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, close victories in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties supporting independence have been hard to maintain this year's initiative, as many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or are awaiting trial because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with the phone in support of the police, explained that the protests had sparked politics on both sides.
“Temperance is rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he will run for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The best way to condemn regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen in the Spanish government is to run European elections," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men flying into the house with the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested because they flew into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 19.30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building were damaged.
At some point, they're supposed to be shooting at the car with a gunshot.
With the Mengaja strike, Livingston won with 1:0 against Rangser
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston won
Livingston surprised Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 matches as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Mengaya arrow made the difference, because Gary Holt's team was compared to the Hibernian team in the other place.
Gerrard's team remained so unbeatable in guests in this year's championship, and the next week, Hearts, who lead on the ladder and behind, are waiting for eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone has increased his number of in defeats in the six-game division and coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted defeat.
Livingston has opened up opportunities against direct guests
Holt's team should be leading a lot before the strike, because with their direct response to Rangserm, they caused a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but he sent the ball through the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the doorbell, and Craig Halkett shot his head through the goal.
The guests left the game Rangser because they knew that guests could be dangerous when interrupting the attack.
And in this way they also came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Menga, who shot and beat from the middle of the prison.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but the domestic defenses couldn't get through and Liam Kelly's door had little work.
This sample continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was able to defend Kelly.
Rangers' doorman Allan McGregor was standing up to defend Scott Pittman's shot, and Lithgow was shot naked from another lifeston break in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingston's penal area, but the locals refused all the attacks, two violations – Halket's violation of Glen Middleton's replacement and the violation of the hand-playing game – but the judge didn't get it.
“Excellent performance” Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Great show and result for Livingston.
They were all excellent, and they continue to exceed expectations on this path up.
The game style and position have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt must be credited with the way he woke up the team from his income.
It was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and well organized defense, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall.
However, the rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are extremely under the leadership of Gerrard, they are severely lacking in these standards.
There was no shot at the target – only once they successfully beat the host defense – and this is some sort of wake-up for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan was accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 heads from gathering at the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to seeing their president.
He also expressed his opinion by hundreds of Protestants – many of them Kurds – who do not support the Erdogan government and condemned Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to greet him in the country.
In contrast, protests reflect the disunity of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes and others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: the biker was fatally injured in a car race
In London the biker was fatally injured in the race in which the car was involved.
An accident occurred near the crossroads between Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford on the southeast of the city at about 10.15 after British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the rescuers came, but the man died in the crash.
The accident occurred only a few months after the biker died in the race in which the car driver ran off on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the Saturday accident.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man to be able to notify his own.
They set up roadblocks and redirected the bus lines and advised the motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Castle: six guards injured in the exit
Six prison guards were injured in an outlaw in a strictly protected male prison, reported by the prison administration.
He broke up in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 after British summer time and is still going on.
Police officers from the Tornado unit have been called to take care of an exit involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor facial injuries on their own.
The representative of the prison staff said: "We have called specifically trained personnel who will take care of the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and may therefore be further behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was reported to have been the manager of the prison in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, they called the anti-exploited police unit to intervene in a serious riot in which personnel were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remaining energy of the Orcana Rosa hits the way through the southwest of the desert and brings the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Time Service has already issued warnings against sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Orkan Rosa is supposed to get angry over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it'll be late Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Orkan Katrina (1967) was well known 60 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the national centre for hurricanes include 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfalls up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including Rockies and Great Basin, it is expected from 25 to 50 mm of rainfall, individual rainfall can be up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Orcana Rosa may be a real blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, since in the southwest there is currently a dry period.
“As indicated by the American drought tracking centre, good 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Orcana Rosa leads first to the land of the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rose, who still has a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometres per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
Land in Mexico is expected to arrive with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The waterfalls in the parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great danger to the oceans.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with 250 mm of rainfall,” they reported on the weather.com website.
Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression which will then travel through Arizona and against the South Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
“The greatest danger we expect from Orcana Rosa or its remains is abundant rain on the Baja California peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwestern deserts of the Americas,” said the National Orcana Centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earth’s weather in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for attempted murder after finding 16-year-olds with stab wounds at Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excellence Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4.00 after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area at night, police from Avon and Somerset reported.
The cops are calling anyone who might have caught up with the phone to answer.
Trump said Kavanaugh was a "serious and angry" democratic party
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against impatience and unheard of the tactics of a democratic party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered “incompetence and anger” from a democratic party in the process of his appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that she had been sexually assaulted ten years ago when she was a teenager.
At the hearing, she also spoke to Ford about her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that that day “Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage of Kavanaugh”.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service," said a number of supporters in western Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the electoral participation of Republicans in the interim elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm really trying with the candidacy," he said.
"That's why I fight for excellent candidates everywhere."
Trump argues that democracy is on the mission of 'resistance and obstruction'.
The first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh Senate was to take place no later than Friday, the advisor of the Republican Party told the CNN.
In Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami of more than a hundred people killed, the number of victims is increasing
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of them carried large waves that were on the shore.
More than a hundred people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in Pala, when six meters of waves hit the shore by the dark and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When there was a danger of tsunami yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said a representative of the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief Sotopo Purwo Nugroho at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses, everything on the ground,” explained Nugroho and added that he traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photographs from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, wrecked and broken bridges and swamped with water.
The stormy suns continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people, there were a number of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the Friday powerful earthquake was approximately 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb power in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city that lies at the end of the long and narrow flood is to increase the size of the tsunami.
He described the damage as “absolute” and said that several thousand houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be greater at the coast 300 km north of Palau, in the Dongal area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugro said, communications are completely interrupted and have no information from the Dongal area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” said the statement of the Red Cross and added that staff and volunteers are moving to affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received numerous criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunamis had affected Paul, but officials say the waves had arrived just in time for the warning.
In an amateur video, published on social media, it is heard that men on the top floor scream warning people on the street in the approaching tsunamis.
In a few minutes the water wall ran along the coast and took the buildings and the cars with it.
At Reuters, they couldn't verify the accuracy of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis have led to a failure of electricity, which has disrupted communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The authorities report that the military has begun to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other basic necessities of life.
The airport was opened only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is due to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in Indonesia’s tsunami has increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosseb, the members of the World Vision organization from Dongale arrived safely in Pala, where the employees in the courtyard in front of their rooms set up shelters from ponytails, but on the way they saw numerous scenes of desertification.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with much experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, overseas funding, stocks and assistance of personnel shall be authorised only if the city is declared as a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still treated as an accident at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international aid, but it is not yet such status.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing find themselves in the hope that their close miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled the boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble, along with her mother’s corpse.
Gendon Subandano, coach of Indonesia's nuclear parachutes, trained two wrong nuclear parachutes for Asian games that ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
The other, caught at Roa Roa Hotel, were according to Mr. Mandagija's students.
“As an elder in the field of nuclear decay, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in an hour when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel surrounded the communities of sailors, he was in despair sending messages to the WhatsApp contestants in Palu who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked only with one gray bell instead of two blues.
‘I think this means that messages have not been delivered,’ he said.
Dads stole 26.750 USD while filling ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
After reporting to the Newport police on Friday morning, the father stole 26,750 USD from the Brink’s security service, which filled the ATM in the centre of Newport on the Leeve.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver the money, in a public statement, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote.
While he was employed, another man “approached to an employee’s Brink’s back security service” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
After the report, the Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the exact number of participants in the event.
All those who have information on the identity of suspects should call the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – in Ye.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: "Betje with the official name Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has a reputation Yes for some time and he also used it to address his eight-year-old album, which he released in June.
The change comes right before his performance at Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new Yandhi album.
He will replace the song Ariano grande, who has given up the performance for "personal reasons", said the producer of the show.
The word is abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think that “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where “you” means “you”,” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the title of the album to the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you and I'm all me.
Kanye, which means "only", I have changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for Love and Brother Love.
The former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without him and with big letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use forces against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed that he will never use military forces against civilians, just as the country is close to the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza market that "he will never use forces to shut down the Mexican people."
At a time when left-wing student movements began operating in Latin America, 300 people were shot and killed in peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly grants and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education drag young people into criminal associations.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funds it spends on research in this field, says the investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come from the fact that various parts of the U.S. government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in innovations in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the United States and we are looking for a next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding could double the possibility that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will happen in the US, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month, is the President of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most visible art intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an art intelligence system that won the top-ranking U.S. player Othello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee said he was familiar with the previous technological competitions of the American government, such as the competition in robotics organised by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when he would find the following visionaries more easily.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard to get state support, Lee said.
“It’s not the Chinese who takes over the best academics, but they’re companies,” Lee explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working best at the university to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think we should automatically offer a green card to people with an artificial intelligence doctor,” he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions, like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organisations are distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a joint committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment in the AI Next initiative of $2 billion.
National Scientific Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than USD 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research
Meanwhile, the American legislation that wanted to create the National Commission of Safety for Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide in the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday's referendum to change their country's name into 'The Republic of North Macedonia'. This would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour's name constitutes the right to their territory and has put a veto on its accession to NATO and the EU.
The governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the participation would be at least 50 percent as far as the referendum was necessary.
The question on the referendum paper was: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?’
The supporters of the referendum, including the President of the Zoran Zaev government, claim that this price worth paying for joining the bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, is one of the countries that occurred after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote which will be decisive.
The amendment of the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to choose for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje’s capital.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško gave their vote in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 for a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small ore and set up chairs in front of the tents that were set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor state, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
The president of the Zaev government says that NATO membership will bring a strong investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for more than 80 per cent of our citizens to support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after issuing his ballot.
He added that it would be a positive result of 'testing our future'.
The poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that the referendum would take place between 30 and 43% of voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
The second survey carried out by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents would prefer Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote.
In order for the referendum to succeed, there must be a 50 per cent vote vote.
A failed referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the Western government, which took over the mandate of May.
Take a look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has won the entire Brighton defense and victory
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester in England played Brighton's defense at Manchester City with 2-0.
Aguere's hit in 65 minutes was seeming ridiculously simple.
At the start of the action, the Argentine attacker was given at the center of the play.
He ran between the three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He played one defensive player and was faster than the other in Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he gave Sterling to his left.
With his first touch, the English attacker returned the ball to Aguer, who with his right foot beat Brighton's doorman Mathewa Ryan and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is struggling with leg problems," coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the blue son with the initial advantage in the first English league fight.
The goal was reached in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched his balls several times and then sent the Sterling ball against the remote neck.
The blue son attacker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew over naked.
City will meet with Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12.55.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and ruin their ability to address
The Nationals team has come out of the end, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always a competitive Scherzer hopes that Sunday will be able to climb a metal grill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if Rockies still have the opportunity to play at the end because in the Western League they have the advantages of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies on Friday with victory 5:2 over the Nationals team provided the least invited organizer, but still waiting for their first title in the division.
“Although we can’t get anything, at least we’ll be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a lot of people here in Denver and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't you want to compete?"
Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal for a week, but in this case it will probably be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be so first metal 34 times, is on Thursday as a burden player and would have had enough days of rest by Sunday.
The Washington right-wing player collected 18 wins and 7 defeats with an average of 2.53 and 300 hit-outs in 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at the meetings in West Virginia
The President directly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
"All we've done will be on the dice in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I am really working on candidacy, so I am fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats and it is happening now.
They are determined to take over the authority again, using all possible means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to suffer to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to his words, democracy is on the mission of 'resistance and obstruction'.
“And you have seen this in the last four days,” he said and described the Democrats as “serious, evil, low and false”.
A member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, was nominated for a public hearing.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait. It was really a bad body speaker, the worst I've ever seen."
The labyrinth party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinions, she is impatient.
When Momentum's activist in my local party told me a surprise, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who we do not wish to express our opinion.
My colleague, Mrs. Joan Ryan, happened the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, there's been a proposal of mistrust for my non-compliance with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a statement on Friday's meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party, it said that ‘we want meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In eight years, as a member of the Parliament of the local Labour Party, the Friday meetings were mostly exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this tone is not used in most meetings today, and the promise of a more "friendly and gentle" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it ever started.
It is increasingly evident that different views in the laboratory parties are not permissible and that each opinion considers whether this is acceptable for the party’s management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and my colleagues, whom I had previously thought to share similar political views, were expecting me to change my opinion and adopt a position that I would never agree with – whether in the field of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public – and in fact it is not important what I say – they follow criticisms on social networks that call for non-election, condemn politics in the middle and tell me that they should not be in a labuistic party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have are just political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet each day with the flood of sexist or racist complainants, but they are not allowed to be frightened.
One of the most deplorable aspects of this policy period is how the levels of abuse have become something quite ordinary.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that a labyrinth should promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with every proposal of mistrust or amendment of the rules for the choice of a party is becoming more difficult.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice to take my head off and not be so loud, but I'm gonna be "all right."
But I didn't get into politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student – the reason for this was the poorness of the Tatcher government, which has brought the school literally to an end in my primary school – I have tried to become a local minister or minister for better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political convictions, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could have been confused about my political position and areas that I did not agree with with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to spend time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the state is pushing against the Brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not about Nottingham Momentum, but about my voters and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud that I have served you, and I promise you that no threat to my choice or political suitability will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.

Father 38:17 Melrose: Unprecedented Father, not lord over Latvian
Two well-known experiments have revealed a few final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr won the victory in this wonderful fun first-day game.
Now they're at the top of the ladder and they're the only unbeatable team of ten.
In the end, the weightier on the home page translated their supreme defense and better use of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“In our current games, we have endured many trials and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The congratulations to the Ayra team, the opportunities have been better than we have."
Grant Anderson's hit in the 14th minute that Frazier Climo turned, Ayr took the lead, but the Romanian card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who got it in the Warriors game, meant a number of powers for Melrose and Jason Baggott was a great attempt without conversion.
At the violation, the climate increased the leadership for Ayr before he just struck at half an hour and then turned his self-test into a score of 17:5 for Ayr at the storm.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggot into a five-point remnant.
It was followed by a long interruption due to the serious damage to Ruaridh Knott that was carried on the carrier, and then Ayr made progress with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who transformed it into Clima.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the game with the player more with Bruce Colvine's unprocessed attempt at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the guests came back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card due to the obstacle to the free climate, MacPherson got hit in the attack.
Clima reached the points after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing player in the fifth attempt of the hosts.
The Still Game Series star starts a new hospitality career
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is obviously given into the hospitality, rather than becoming the director of a licensed company with restaurants.
A 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, which he also wrote the script, played Jack Jarvis along with a long-standing partner in comedy by Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that after the next ninth season the last one, and it seems Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Arigingmorn Limited is the Director.
The player did not want to comment on the stories, but the source for the Scottish Sun was that Kiernan wanted to join the "flowery hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, sailors are exposed to blue flags.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
In central Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the excruciating of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may now be the greatest after decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be received after five years of consultation on 1 October.
"Bolivia has a beginning, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course a positive spirit awaits the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia, which argues that, after decades of unsustainable talks, Chile must negotiate access to sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian charismatic native president, waiting for a controversial re-election battle next year, has also high expectations regarding Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide on the issue of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The United Nations headquarters in the Netherlands has no authority to assign Bolivia to the Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice only comes six months after hearing the final arguments means that the case ‘was not complicated’,” said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken in Bolivia, but they may have a lot of money.
"The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea," Zarateva said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric from the Chilean people reflected all the good will that may have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
They haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusual decision quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "excellent opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "enduring 139-year conflicts with each other's benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political defense.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to predict that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea said nuclear disarmament would not happen if it could not be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never first destroy their nuclear weapon unless they could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a talk at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil their commitments made at a meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when US Minister Mike Pompeo is apparently before the resumption of nuclear diplomacy, which was at the dead point, more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the U.S. is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the contradictions of the announcement of the end of the Korean war will be restored to North Korea on its knees.
Washington is careful when confirming the prediction without Pjongang first taking decisive disarmament measures.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, it is generally doubtful that Pjongang is serious about the withdrawal of the weapon that the state sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pjongang next month to prepare everything for another meeting of Kim and Trump.
In fashion magazines in Paris, discover the latest line of huge covers that come in stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complete your cover collection or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to search further.
The designer Valentino and Thom Browne, in their collections for spring and summer 2019, discovered on the fashion track a collection of wonderfully large covers that blinded the fold in Paris's fashion week.
Very impractical coverage covered this summer, flooding Instagram, and the designer sent their spectacular creations to the fashion track.
Valentine's piece, which was the most outstanding, was a blue hat with wide edges decorated with a feathers-like additives in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too large fashion accessories included skulls with precious stones, magic hat and even pineapple – but your heads will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – exactly the right time for the night of witches.
Many colored masks have their lips covered and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter's masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to the diving equipment with a breather and glasses, and the other was seen as an ice-cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge cover will come to shops near you.
Wide hats are closely followed by "La Bombi", a broken hat with 60 centimeters of limbs were observed on Rihanni and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand for extremely impractical hats that flooded the social network sent another great creation – a straw bag for the beach, which was almost as large as the model in the baths it was carrying.
The Rafia bag in burnt orange colours, made with rafia resins and white leather gloves, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection of Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019.
Stylist of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to get into the store for the next summer – since the designer made such a powerful impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for too many additions.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is key to global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoyed the awards of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results in the exams that further strengthen individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) are trying to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they have as a global citizen.
As an education sector that can shape and implement an adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in the language he understands, the conversation will come to his mind.
But if you speak with a man in his mother tongue, his words shall enter into his heart. ”
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent examinations show that languages are at the top of the ladder with the highest levels of performance in independent schools.
68 percent of the students who learned that language were well evaluated.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of students achieved excellent grades in Mandarin and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are considered to be an optional subject in the curricula of independent schools and others as objects in the fields of nature, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The survey carried out by the Commission in 2014 for the employment and training of the United Kingdom showed that, for reasons of harassment by employers for filling jobs, 17% of the population is attributed to a lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming more and more urgent in preparing young people for their future career.
For future employment opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, he has a great advantage in the future, regardless of the career he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge.
A multilingual person who can directly agree with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom showed that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, while French was the only language spoken by the two-point question, which was 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those from developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
Schools in Scotland differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that should be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, you will always be able to choose many languages taught by experts in this field in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment, languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, and this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Schools Council
LeBron will debut in San Diego on Sunday in Lakers' dress
For fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, there will be an end soon.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton predicted that James would play in a Sunday's pre-season pre-season event against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one and less than 48”, explains Walton on the Lakers team’s official website.
The official rapporteur of the Lakers team Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six Lakers games before the season.
"At this stage, I don't need a game before the season," he said.
trumpet assembly in West Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia starts a series of meetings in his campaign.
This is the first of the Trump's five planned meetings next week, including its country-to-country developments, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a free place in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to get support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the loss of control of Congress after the November vote.
At what time will Trump's assembly in West Virginia and where will you be able to view it online?
The trumpet assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. after east time.
The troupe assembly in West Virginia can be viewed live on the YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about hearings for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have become tense because of allegations of sexual offence, which is why the Senate's confirmation is expected to be postponed for one week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the primary objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans who are awaiting important elections in November to get a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five meetings were aimed at "encouragement of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Observation at the Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel in as many countries as possible during the intense campaign season," Reuters told a representative of Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed.
Today's assembly at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling would also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania after reporting on the West Virginia MetroNews radio, which would attract the interest of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public research.
"For Morrisey there is a bad sign that the president must come and "raise him" in public research," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, after Reuters report.
Ryderje’s 2018 Cup: The U.S. team still wants to win and keep hope out of Sunday’s individual fights
After three foreign games, maybe the Saturday afternoon duo of two (foursomes) were what Ryder's Cup this year needed.
There is a completely imaginary sports concept, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions.
So where did it go now?
“They have had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so this is probably a new start for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage because it leads by four points, and twelve more can be achieved.
But according to the Spiet words, the Americans feel that they have wind in the sails, and among other things, they are encouraged by the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was desperate from the initial blow to the vegetable and gave a good example.
The screams of luck continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas and he were left with two points of equation in the fourth game.
The strike that won them on the 15th of the hole has created a similar scream, such as to let you know that you believe that the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to look for your inner power and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to glory.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual but charming two of Europe has won four points out of four and they are inexcusable.
The two "Molliwood" were the only ones who didn't hit the bug on Saturday afternoon and avoided bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy flows between them and the noise community clearly confirms the fact that once they are those players who will have to beat them on Sunday, and no other player could better seal Europe's possible victories than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over the Le Golf National.
And if you can, you're both at the same time in different holes.
But talking about European fame would be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson beat Sergia Garcia, a morning hero in the game with four balls, who was in pairs with Alex Noren.
Because of the bugs and two double bugs in the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they did not find a way out.
But on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and two match games are exceptionally interesting to be monitored from close because of communication between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has been playing better than the team so far and has had great advantage before the last few days, but the two sides have shown that the U.S. team also wants to win, which some, especially on the American side, have doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 before Ryder's last day
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's fight with a nice advantage after Saturday's games with four balls and two-man dubbed with 10:6 against the United States.
A great couple, composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, gave their best and with two victories over Tiger Woods and at Le Golf National played four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to win the trophy she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had in the morning games four balls over the American team she had sinned and said in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team fought better in the doubles, where they won two games, but the remains couldn't be compensated.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newspaper to win four consecutive points, while Molinaria (a couple named Molliwood) won four points in its first four games in Ryder’s history after the sensational end of the week.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they again appeared and more convincingly defeated the exhausted Woods and the American newspaper Bryson Dechambeauja with 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at the moment, but lost 19 of the 29 games in four balls and two doubles, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning games with four balls, returned for the two-two fights and in pairs with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were placed on the first and third seats on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, everything did not go according to the plans of the European team.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for the Americans on Saturday.
With 2 and 1, they won against Spanish Jon Rahma and Ian Poulter in four balls and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two matches, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history did the team return after four points were left before the individual fights, although the Fury team only needs an equation to maintain the trophy.
But after two days in the second place, the Sunday counterattack may seem to be too much for her.
North Korea: "Without confidence we will never be unilaterally disarmed"
The North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday to the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions would cause an increasing mistrust in the United States and that North Korea would certainly not give up its nuclear weapon unilaterally under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had adopted a number of "significant measures in good will" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile attempts, supporting nuclear attempts and promises not to expand nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be convinced of state security and under such conditions we will not ever be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the well-known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington’s resistance to the progressive approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures, his statement was important because he did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjonngang had done in the past.
Ri made a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current president of the United States and the North Korean leader, who took place in Singapore on 12 June. Kim then made a commitment to strive for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pjongang must first give up the nuclear weapon.
Washington also did not allow the call to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The United States insists that we first have to disarm itself and step up the pressure with sanctions to achieve its objectives by force, and even condemn the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“In thinking that sanctions could put us on our knees, it is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
However, the problem is that further implementation of sanctions will further deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President presented to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Ja In, which took place over the past five months, and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be discussed with South Korea and not the United States, nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
Nevertheless, the tone of Rije's speech was quite different from that of the day when the United Nations General Assembly said that the attack on the United States territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable, after "Mr. evil President" Trump Kima called himself "a rocket husband" on a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage at the United Nations meeting when taking disarmament measures, but said that he still had much work to do and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is nuclearly disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that this was not an expected time frame, and he said: “The duration may be two years, three years or five months – this is not important.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: “The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue without exception until we recognise the complete, complete and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to disable the financing of North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Riem met with the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongang would visit again next month because of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pjongang in July, he said that he had made progress, and North Korea had criticised him in a few hours if his demands were "gangster".
At the meeting with Mun, which took place this month, North Korea committed itself to the failure of the missile test station and the nuclear test infrastructure if the United States adopted "relevant measures".
Kim should be told that the ‘relevant measures’ mean the security provided by Trump in Singapore and the measures to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of the new year's course at Harvard University is for all graduate students to learn how to enjoy more sleep. With such courses they want to fight against the growing mastical culture of "celonical" learning, in which the powers are collected with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best universities often do not know the basis for caring for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, formed a course that was based on his first kind in the United States.
In order to carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, "Why do I know that now that I'm in my last year?"
She said no one told her how important it was to sleep, and for the newspaper The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised him.
The course they are taking this year for the first time speaks of the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving the overall good feeling.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, says that they decided on such a course when they found that the student was significantly undernourished during the week.
The Enourishment course includes many interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a student home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports blankets and books to obtain information about the influence of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports success and the importance of sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
The student settlement map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that the behaviour of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking cigarettes," adds Professor Cheisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present in “permanent whole-night learning”. It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in a lack of sleep, is a growing problem.
Professor Cheisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be the "hidden weapons" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This can also avoid getting harder – brains go hungry because of lack of sleep, which is why students are constantly hungry.
19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Cheisler to form a course. Last year he attended one of the professor's lectures at Harvard.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct classes throughout the student village.
It is hoped that in the next phase, the undergraduate students will be able to request the completion of a similar study programme before entering a competition institution.
Professor Cheisler advises students to continue sleeping as well as getting confused. He also wants to remind them of the harmful effects of ‘modern lights’ that electronic screens and LED lighting provide, as they can cause Circadian rhythm imbalances, which make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with zadekm subpils up Gerrard's team
Rangers once again defeated in the guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone declared the team Steven Gerrard sentenced to defeat with 1 : 0.
The team from Ibroxa has been hunting its first winning victory after February at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but Gary Holt's team has been defeating it in 18 matches since the Gerrard team's head, leaving his team behind 8 points for the leading team of the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the chosen type of Rangers didn't give the impression that she wanted to compare.
The Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingston progressed to a third place, but with a different goal, the Hibernian team remained.
The issue of Rangers was not over with this. Calum Spence, a party judge, suffered head injury when after reporting to him the subject came from the city of cheerleaders visiting the team.
Gerrard, in a crew that won Ayr without any difficulty and placed himself in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt was holding on to the check-in nurse Livingstone, who had taken the point of the Hearts team a week earlier, and he was no doubt excited about how his affected team had effectively neutralized all the guests' attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came two minutes after Menga found Scott Pittman with the first brief introduction, which then went to Allan McGregor's goal, but the link was inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
Long shot Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, Rangers took control, but the game was more of a hope than a real wish for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was quite sure that after a 15-minute match with Steven Lawless, a criminal shot should have been reached, but Judge Steven Thomson had thrown Colombian demands into the horse.
The first half managed to draw up only two shots on the target, but did not shoot with the head sent against the target by Lassana Coulibaly, or Oviey Ejarie's ball, and did not present any danger to Liam Kelly's doorman.
Livingstone's initial goal in 34 minutes may have surprised everything, but he's already deserved it because of his endurance.
Rankser couldn't get another one of Jacob's resumes for a long time.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher made the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi to submit for a simple conclusion of the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during Coulibaly's vacation, he replaced Ryan Kent's wing player, who immediately showed up with Morelos, but Kelly effectively flew off his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced guests into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett took care of more than one goal.
Holt's team could have increased its leadership by the end of the race, but McGregor had effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was not accurate.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the option of a criminal shot after contact with Jacob, but Judge Thomson didn't admit it.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
We present pages from the Germans of our Sunday editions: September 30, 1882, so today more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world famous physicist.
Geiger developed the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's nuclei.
It became a stable in the scientific world, and it also gained its place in pop-culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's count. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your earpieces on, you can actually hear the effect on the atoms of radioactive activity in the materials.’
Evans: "Madonica, but now they're really out!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
Imagination with his name lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize attack cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and destroy attack cells
In the course of treatment, the immune system should be trained to identify the attackers
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells in patients who have then been modified into the laboratory
They can then ‘see’ protein, which is significant for many forms of cancer, then return to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine that the immune system learned to recognize the attackers, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients that are modified into the laboratory so that they can see the HER2 protein, which is significant for many cancer forms, and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research at Bethesde, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘promots the growth of several different types of cancer’, including breast, ovaries, lungs and fat.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells in patients who are "teached" to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a protruder point with the inscription of the MAGA on the drop after the performance on the SNL.
The public was not impressed
Kanye West was excited at the Saturday Night Live show's studio at a strange point, during which he expressed his support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 would compete for the Presidential Chair.
At the end of his third performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began with an attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support to Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I care about racism, I should have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The current SNL show began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood player was horrified by Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission accused Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
The video of the West Monologue was not played, but it was uploaded by the comic book Chris Rock on the social network.
It's not known if Rock was going to make it out of the West.
West also complained to the public that he had some problems in the tank because of writing on a hat.
"They've got me behind bars.
They told me, "Don't go to the roof with this hat."
They put me on duty!
But they say I'm lost," he said after the Washington Examiner report.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost scene?" and he added that he had to hope "The Superman border, because that means no one can tell me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
His comments were prepared by the public at least twice and the members of the SNL team were obviously in a hurry, and someone told Vanity: “The study was a death silence.”
The West was the last time they invited a goat replacement for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
West has caused a lot of surprise already with the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore the costume of the Perrier mineral water bottle.
West supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for being UPRL Paradise.”
But Karen Hunter, the chairman of the talk show, insisted that the West is simply “what it is, and it’s all right.
However, I will not reward anyone (with the purchase of his music, clothing or support of his "art") who, in my opinion, greets and spreads ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and will then “be formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE.”
He's not the first musician to decide to change his name, but before him did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His roommate Snoop Dog was once named Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: the Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as the Prince.
A man accused of attempted murder for stabbing a person in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he was imprisoned on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused must be brought before the court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Star Game of the throne Kit Harington acted sharply against toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known after his match in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series Game thrones.
A 31-year-old player who strongly condemned the stereotype of a masquerade hero says that due to the emergence of such applications on screened young boys, they often feel that respect can only be earned with firmness.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that in his opinion something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of male toxicity during the #JazTudi period.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old fellow player from Rose Leslie's throne, admitted to having strong convictions about this subject.
“I am personally seriously wondering where we have made a mistake when it comes to manhood,” he said.
“What have we taught men during our growing up about the problems we are now facing?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of the male due to the display of very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do we learn on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose this particular wage of manhood?
I think it's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change that?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in the recording of any preview or continuation of the Games of the thrones, because he was "completed with battles and horses".
Kit will play in the main role of the new True West Sam Shepard show, which is a story about a film producer and his brother a thief.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the game of the throne was that he met his wife Rose on the recording.
"For this series I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here," he said.
Rose played Ygritte in a fantasy series, awarded with Emmy, the love choice of Kitt's character, Jon Snow.
A couple reported on their visit to the Leslie family in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual intercourse, which is a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV has usually spread rapidly as a result of a blood-infected transfusion.
However, according to Chinese health officials, the number of people infected with HIV in the province of Junan fell to almost nothing, according to the conference in Junan.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS continues to increase annually in China by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV with sex is a very serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against persons from the LGBT community is still very high.
As conservative values are still in place in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to women.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government as part of its efforts to solve the problem has promised general access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff has issued information about the Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “theory of conspiracy”
On Saturday, the American Congressman Maxine Waters rejected the allegations that a member of her staff had published information about three American republican senators on their website in Wikipedia.
The democracy in Los Angeles has confirmed that these charges come from individuals and websites of the extreme right.
"False, lie and more inevitable lies," Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The published information as indicated includes domestic addresses and telephone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Hatcha from Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, which was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill, during the Senate's meeting on charges of sexual harassment of a senior judge, Bretta Kanaugh.
The information was withdrawn after the three senators closed with the hearing of Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedStates state that it is possible to identify the source of the publication to be linked to the office of Senator Waters and to conclude that information has been published by one of the staff, says Hill.
“These unwarranted charges are completely wrong and pure lies”, Watersov continues.
"My employees whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these false charges are not at all responsible for the processing of these data.
These unwarranted charges are completely false and purely false.’
Senator Waters' statement quickly came into touch with criticism online, including by former White House representative Aria Fleischer.
“From this denial of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it is not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motives of the one who charged him.
You must stay calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too obviously angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is taking part in the interim elections for Watersov, announced himself via Twitter.
"If that's true, it's serious," he tweeted.
In her statement, Watersova stated that her cabinet had informed the relevant institutions and prosecution authorities about these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for tips on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and is also used to revive Johnny English's action comedy, which came into force for the first time in 2003 with the title Johnny English and continued in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how we hate a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English with its eyelids and unusual griffasms obtains permission to remix the shells; his name already indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinematographic audience in English speaking areas.
It is a strange secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, Mr. Beana's cane and the smallness of the one who contributed the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the Olympics in London in 2012.
It is also based on the passenger and international mystery that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving for himself real chaos.
One or two pleasant moments are presented in the latest movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wore medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were short of his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly displayed, but humor seems a little soft and unnecessary, especially because "real" films like 007 or the Mission cannot now offer comic elements without bad news.
It seems that humor is intended for children and not for adults, so for me to reject the adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and targeted as Atkinson does not jump into Mr Bean's role.
The constant theme is now obvious that Britain is in serious trouble.
The internet hacker infiltrated the Internet network of British most secret agents and revealed the identity of all British agents, causing major problems to the competent agent, which Kevin Eldon represents in a surprising small role.
This is a point of break for the prime minister, a late figure who, because of political unlovedness, has already experienced a crime: Emma Thompson has done her best to play the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing plausible in the scenario that could help.
The notifying authority shall inform it that all active spies are exposed and shall decide on one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school who teaches informally how to work undercover: here the screenwriters won, because English performs some sort of voyeur "academia rock".
English is being taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting where he meets with a longtime associate of Bough, who plays Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the commander of the submarine, a stereotype sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine loses a little bit.
Thus, Batman and Robin are prepared to create more problems on behalf of the secret service of her Highness, and they meet the fatal Ophelio Bulletin played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the premiere is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their dissipation: dressed in a player-backed fire in a French restaurant, created chaos when you overslip on the roof of the Volt yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to get to know the interior of the Volt house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energy of the film, it reminds the children of the film.
Very average.
Like other movies, Johnny English, I can't help myself here and think: is the British Atkinson able to play a role that actually warrants his talent?
Laborists deny that British are planning a four-day work week, which would pay for a five-day work week.
The labyrinth party, Jeremiah Corby, is thinking about a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment in five days.
The company leader party wants the savings generated by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to flow to workers and provide them with an additional day off.
This would make it possible for employees to enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high wage.
The Viris say that the idea is in line with the customer's economic plan and the plan for the country to stand on the side of the workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the advantages of a changing economy.
The Labour Party's source said to The Sunday Times: 'A policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-day worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve by the customer's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party supported the four-day working week in its campaign in 2017 general elections.
This objective, however, is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Laborist Party said: "The four-day working week is not the policy of the party and the party does not think about it."
The Chancellor of the Shadow John McDonnell spent the past week using the Labour Conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to exert the power of "responsive directors" and "responsors" in municipal companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current stakeholders in water companies may not regain their full share, as the laboristic party could, on the basis of alleged guilt, introduce "debts".
It also confirmed the plans for the inclusion of workers in the Administrative Committees and the introduction of the Ownership Inclusion Fund, which would transfer 10 per cent of the share of private enterprises to employees that would receive annual dividends up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, discussed whether their opinion could change the investigation by the FBI by Kavanaugh.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the FBI has suspended the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of any Republican senator’s office could persuade the judge to withdraw his support.
In an interview held on Sunday, a “60-minute” Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could find out anything that would change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this charge came up, I asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, uncompromising, unquestionably."
And Graham's voice seems stuck in the rock.
"I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change," he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett definitely denied it, ” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she named could confirm this.
The issue is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens (Global Citizen Festival) and whether has contributed to poverty reduction in any way?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event involving a truly exceptional type of stars and having the same exceptional mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by dozens of people. It will be attended not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to stimulate interest in the real purpose of the event, namely to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens' Project, an international group of advocates hoping to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free entry for the event (unless you were prepared to pay for the VIP entry), the participants of the concert had to perform a variety of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, letter to the world leader, telephone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has remained for 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is this just another example of the so-called ‘clickivism’ – the creation of a belief that people actually have a significant impact on the relationship with the signing of the petition or the mediation of the tweet?
The Movement of Global Citizen states that since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' of their supporters should be recorded in their efforts for a variety of objectives.
He says that these actions helped global leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than USD 37 billion, which would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By 2018, the Group indicated that its 390 commitments and messages had already been paid or collected at least USD 10 billion.
The group estimates that so far, the funds collected directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and decision makers, committed to “help children realize their full potential”, which Rwanda promised $35 million to help eliminate nutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets of the Global Citizens' Movement.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can bring the social guilt of nutrition into the historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, an ambassador of the Moč Food Partnership, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, following more than 5,000 actions undertaken by the United Kingdom, had announced that it would co-finance the Food Force project, which would reach 5 million women and children with food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?",
the movement Global citizen replied: "This will be a long and hard path – sometimes we will fall and fall.
But like the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid before us, we will also succeed because we are stronger together.
Among some performers who will take place at this event in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will lead Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to ‘block’ Russian exports of energy — the US Ministry of the Interior
The US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke is expected to say after reporting Washington Examiner that Washington could use the Navy to prevent the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, "if necessary".
Zinke said that Russian mediation in Syria (it is necessary to warn the legal government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they are in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
However, according to the official, there are ways and means to cope with this.
“The United States can fly this. The Navy ensures that our waterways are open and blocked as necessary, preventing Russian energy from getting into the market,” he said.
Zinke referred to the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Union, an invincible group known as the "power consumers' voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, warning that it was actually the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic potential is more or less influenced by and replaced by fuels," said Russia, marking a "ponie who knows one trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements were made at a time when Trump's administration was trying to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it would undermine Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials of the Trump government, including the US president Donald Trump themselves, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "unacceptable" gas pipeline project North Stream 2, which would lead to the "talec" of Moscow in view of the Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline is worth USD 11 billion, which is intended to double the existing gas pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic metres, excluding the economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is about unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy must not be a tool for implementing pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Association of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"Interfering a third country into our energy supply is a major problem for me," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "research carefully" his candidacy for the US President's election in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "examine carefully" her candidacy for the US President after the interim elections.
In the city house in Holyoke in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was going to think about her candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which a woman’s leader requires,” said The Hill, after reporting.
"After November 6th, I will study my candidacy for the President in detail."
Warren's meeting in the city house was held by President Donald Trump, since he was "to lead this country in the wrong direction."
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, I'm very worried," she said.
Warren Trump and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh have repeatedly openly criticised him.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the elections."
The poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not compete for the presidency in 2020.
According to a poll by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, the senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent would support her candidacy.
The survey showed that it had more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of respondents being supported and 48% being opposed.
Other high-ranking democracies that would be considered as candidates for the 2020 elections are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Bianne, after reporting to the Associated Press, said he would decide by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palina in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, survived a year after joining the army in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with family violence
“As my own son goes through what he experiences after his return, he connects me with other families who are facing post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain measure of injury that our soldiers are returning with,” he told the public at a meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palinova's son's arrest was marked as an "island in the salon" and said that her son and other military veterans were returning a few changed, stiffened, wondering where respect for what the prisoners and aircraft and all other members of the army were giving to the country."
Track Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla in Alaska and accused of violence in the family with an attack on women, an obstacle to reporting violence in the family and possession of weapons in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a police station representative in Wasilla.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the rejection of a new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the District of Colombia support the legal rejection of a new American policy, which renounces the right to asylum for victims who flee from violence tolls or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the above-mentioned district filled the court hearing on Friday to support the legal rejection of the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's case against the Sessions filed by the American Union for Civil Liberties against Federal Policy has not been published.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the crowd", abused her, but on July 20th, the American authorities rejected her asylum claim.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states that support Grace, Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications are made in the United States, are described as countries that are constantly facing problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision of the Committee on Immigrant Calls, which enabled unregistered immigrants fleeing violence within the family to apply for asylum.
The State Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "respects the decade of state, federal and international law."
‘Federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application and that such a prohibition violates this principle’, states the application submitted to the Court.
State prosecutors have further stated, upon request, that the policy that denies immigrants the right to enter is detrimental to the American economy, since it is likely that they will become entrepreneurs and that they will "provide the necessary labour force".
Prosecutor-General Jeff Sessions told the immigration judge not to give any more asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and domestic violence in June.
‘Assil is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion’, the Sessions said in their policy publication on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to eliminate all the problems, even the serious problems people face every day throughout the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate attempts to rescue them are under way to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma’s 35-year-old mother when she comforted her hot boyfriend at the evacuation center in a broken town of Pala.
"The rescuers constantly import bodies.
It lacks clean water.’
They seemed to have settled, returning to destroyed homes that had been through the overcrowded things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Two Haris, who had suffered back and shoulder injury, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated freely due to constant severe aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he mentioned the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was raised with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was pushed against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency. He added that he was in town with his family because of the wedding.
"I heard a woman calling for help and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘adjusting’ with ‘propaganda’
One week after the publication of a four - page announcement of the official Chinese magazine in the U.S. daily, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China Beijing accused the abuse of the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last week the paid supplement of officer China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register – the most sold magazine in the state of Iowa, after China accused interference in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denied.
The Agency Reuters reported that US Federal Officers have accused Trump of trying to interfere with the U.S. federal elections, described as a new phase in Washington's ever-intensification effort to press China.
Although advertising to promote trade is common to foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an ever-intensive trade war in which they exchange attacks by introducing customs duties on imported products.
The Chinese refunds at the beginning of the trade war should affect exporters in the federal countries such as Iowa, which are supporting the Trump Republican Party, were said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former Chinese long-standing Governor Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had been affected by American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the Sunday edition of the Officials of Des Moines Register, "now this harassment doubles by publishing advertisements in our own free press".
“In the expansion of propaganda, the Chinese government has used a valued American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions in the Beijing newspapers and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have about the worrying Chinese economic path because the municipalities are closely controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese magazines rejected the publication offer” of his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans lose elections before the mid-elections with the Kavanaugh sex, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming interim elections with the loss of elections.
The feelings here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University College in Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to kill angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday. They won’t forget it either tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national representative of the movingon group on Friday, following the report of Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang "November Coming!" when they demonstrated in the Senate hall when the Republicans that oversee the judicial committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, the news portal Mic reported.
"The spirit and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all the borders," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-foreign political analyst to reporters.
"People say they're strong now, and that's what they hold.
But it could be even stronger, especially between undefined elections in suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29 years who do not like the President but do not like frequently."
Even prior to Ford's public testimony, in which she described in detail her allegations of a candidate's sexual assault on the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have a negative impact.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, after reporting to NBC News at the beginning of the previous week.
“It’s not only about the vote of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh vote; it’s also about the way the Republicans accept it and how Fordova was treated,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, for television channel, who supports Democrats in the elections.
The Americans, however, seem to be a few divided between whether to believe in the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a few more supporting the latter.
The new YeGov poll says that 41 percent of respondents are sure or most trusted in Ford's testimony, and 35 percent were told that they are sure or most trusted in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent were told that they believed that Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during the witness, and only 30 percent about Ford said so.
Following the pressure of Flake FBA, he is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford's testimony last week before the Senate's courtroom was that when Kavanaugh was 17 years old, she was attacked in a guilty state.
Ramirez says that she was shown sex when they were together at the party during her study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a world-wide inventor, is opening up a start-up company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners' solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrupt purpose was "to dominate the world".
"We have decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"Games for a historical moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable the user to create a ‘private storage store’ or a POD
This may include contact details, lists of events, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drives, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal data storage repository is that the user can determine in full who can access the information.
This company is referred to as ‘personal data clearance’.
Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of a company is to pool resources, processes and appropriate skills that will allow access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers for work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could break all their business models overnight.”
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday publication on the Media portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the purpose of Inrupt is "to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network, built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet through the establishment of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"As far as I'm concerned, I'm extremely optimistic," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the Victorian Cross from the 1st World War
For 100 years in the home city, they celebrate the bestowal of the Victorian cross to the only English church priest who won it as a fighter in the first world war.
Colonel Bernard Vann deserves recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was shot by a gunman, and he never learned that he had been given this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, two Colonel's grandsons discovered a monumental stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “extremely symbolic” that they discovered the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act with which he earned his reputation.
Following the report of Officer London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Quintin "through a very dense fog and under the powerful fire of the battlefield and the mechanics."
Later, he planned against the shooting line and with the "most heroism", he led the line, and then I attacked and beat three members of the squad.
Colonel Vanna shot a German archer on 4 October 2018 – just a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the old father’s actions were “something I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vanna, after the parade led by the honor of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they also placed the wedding.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this paradise" and "that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will express."
The enthusiasts of mixed martial arts spent all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they were part of Puise Pepe.
Imagine: You spent all night looking at the completely sold Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose covered 13 dubbes, including the sixth on the main park, and was carried alive in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to compromise, the viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed to find that the transmission had been replaced by Pujs Pep’s drawing.
Many were not very excited because he stayed up until morning just because of the fight.
One of the fans described the switch on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
‘In accordance with the Government Regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children's programme,’ said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa's money.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that future viewers in the United Kingdom would be included.
"When I think about replaying, I think we can fix it," Coker said.
“But then there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to arrange it until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages were exchanged at the time of the break and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix the issue; we thought it was just a technical mistake.
But the real reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of the six, we will carry five dubbes — as usual. We have tried to offer worshipers more than expectations, and we have done so.
It's a very ungrateful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inappropriate" about sexuality.
The Olympic divers Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt inferior to everyone — but gave him the motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that "not everyone like him" knew when he entered high school.
Speaking at the first play of Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for radio station 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give another "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, he reduced his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular director of a long - term show, Kirsty Young, was absent because of a multiple - month illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outsider in Laverne's first performance, said he felt “less worth” than everyone else, because “it wasn't socially acceptable to want boys and girls.”
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity are a real thing that gives me the strength and stamina to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally know about his direction.
Twice the bronze Olympic contestant became an influential advocate of LGBT rights and appeared twice this year at the National Community Games in Australia to invite countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy, that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that he was a novelist with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 – “a surprise.”
Daley reported last year, but said that the difference in years never meant problems.
“When you’re so young” – at the age of 14, he attended the first Olympics, and three years later his father died – he said it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar climbs and falls.
A couple of June adopted a child, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that this changed his "whole view".
“If you asked me last year, it would be all I had to say is “I need to get a gold medal”,” he said.
“However, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had entry tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and even when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I had to finally admit that he wasn’t harmless,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to drown in the Olympics before the home community. There was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs – the Piper of Heather Small, which was followed by his preparations for the Olympics and still his skin.
The play Desert Island Discs plays at BBC Radio 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared mickelson's Saturday Ryder's Palace
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to go back in shape so it won't be an accident.
Mr. Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event on record 12 times, Captain Furyk was allowed to sit at the Saturdays.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as often as for the United States, the winner spent the day part as a cheerleader and part in improving his game in order to correct what was more difficult for him.
Given that even at the top of his career he did not measure the most straightness, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow Le Golf National playing field, where the long ice is inevitably punishing the wrong hits.
And if only the game wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will have a deal with the British Open Francesc Molinarie's exact winner in the ninth match this week, which was linked to the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who have four games at the start of the 12 game were to start well, it could prove to be a decisive game.
Fury expressed his trust in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, he hit me on his back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Fury said.
"There's a lot of trust in you.
He is one of the most famous and in the past, and this week he has also made an exceptional contribution to the teams.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing two games.
I've imagined more, but that's how it came out, and we thought it should be done.
He wants to play, just like everyone."
Nick Falda's record will be broken by Mickeyson on Sunday for the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Fury said his presence on the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to work crazy from people and he's great to have him in the crew room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun when they moved in with him this week, what was fun to see."
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be gained
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that the important advantage can easily be turned into an unpleasant drive at the start of the last day of the game of the Ryder Cup.
Young Danec debuted in 1997 at the game in Valderram, where the party, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, had five points of advantage in front of the Americans, but through the goal she was preferred only for the hair, with the result of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
“Don’t forget that we had a lot of advantage in Valderram; we had a lot of advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but hardly,” said Bjorn (on the picture) in a view of the team Class of 2018 , who won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and told the game Le Golf National said 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone on the team that the crash is not over.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until it says so on the table.
We have the goal of winning this podium, and we need to stay focused on it.
He has always said that I focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who is on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, excited about the game of his players at the demanding playground, added: “I would never rush here.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
It's going to be in front of the game tomorrow, so it's going to have to be different.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, your golfers' abilities are tested to the end.
This is the message you have to deliver to the player: Tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and he must get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the turnout on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended as a winner when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every moving word,” he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had led his players to the last day of the game.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this startup is sustained, strong pressure on central games.
We created the right setting and put the boys in a way, until we felt that we were going to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I decided to take this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said about the choice of individuals.
New German warship delayed again
The latest German frigate should be handed over in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War, but local municipalities have been reported as a result of system failures and rapid increases in costs by at least the following year.
The transfer of the ship ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the new class fregat Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now translated into the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, who tells the military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project will raise concerns about delivery.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the old class of the Bremen fregat class.
It is expected that they will have a strong cannon, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and some concealment technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer intervals between maintenance – the latest frragats should be able to stay outside the home port for up to two years.
The constant delay means that the top warships to allow Germany to influence also overseas by its power will have become obsolete until the start of use, says Officer Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the headlines last year, when the German sailor officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
That was the first time that a sailor returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are only a few, and the German municipalities have identified a number of key "programms and technical shortcomings" that would render the warship useless if it was sent to a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class would run a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the working force on the older cargoes of the Bremen class.
It has also proved that the ship is a heavy burden, which reduces its capacity and limits the ability of the Navy to build its future.
The 7000-ton vessel ‘Reinland-Pfalz’ is supposed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the problem has also become the cost of the whole project, including crew training.
This is expected to reach EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) – starting at EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power is diminishing in Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "has lacked ships suitable for navigation."
The officer said that the issue had become even worse over time because the old ships had been demolished and the replacement ships were not provided.
He complained that no boat of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Netopires
A new study is being carried out on the holding of the Scottish High Court, in which they try to discover how bats use food when hunting for food.
They hope that the results will re-enlighten the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help direct future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats and brown bats and round bats on the Inverewe Gardens site in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of netopyrian calls and what kinds of actions they are doing.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their conduct throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of lawns and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects shelters and habitat losses.
The risk is also wind turbines and lighting as well as mussels and certain types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are actually not blind.
Because of nighttime hunting habits, they help themselves to hunt prey more with their ears than with their eyes.
For the precise determination of errors and obstacles on the way of the year, they use a refined echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for providing more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land by country, does not take the dam very seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly carry out investigations, surveys of shelters and occasional rescue.
The organisation has set up the first and for now the only Scottish reserve, especially for bats, in the area of Dumfries and Galloway.
The owner of David Thompson's estate says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"On Thrava we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still a great deal of knowledge about bats, so the work we are doing here and in other occupations will help us better understand what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the premises, as the possible accidental destruction of a single bat can lead to death of up to 400 females and young people, which may mean the loss of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, therefore they are prohibited from killing, harassing or disrupting, and their relatives are also prohibited from destroying them.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Network for the Conservation of Netopires, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and we simply don't know how well their populations are. "
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, and lawyers prepare for the German magazine's complaint
Cristiano Ronaldo called charges of rape to be committed and said that people want to “promot themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for the German magazine's complaint with Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventusa accused him of strengthening the American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375.000 for the silence of the event.
In an interview with 142 million followers in Instagram Live video several hours after reporting, Ronaldo, 33, marked the report for "false news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was false news," said a Gold Ball winner in the camera five times.
"By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want everyone well," the player smiled.
Ronald's lawyers, after reporting to the Reuters agency, prepare themselves for the Der Spiegel magazine for complaints called "an unacceptable report on personal life suspicion".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for “indemnity damage in amount corresponding to the seriousness of a violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was to take place in June 2009 at the hotel Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
In the documentation submitted to the District Court of Clark in Nevada, after meeting Mayorg and Ronald at night club, he should return to the player's room, and this should be an analytic.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after that event and told her that he was a “99% good man” who only disappoints in “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed sexual relations, but described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were recorded in the hospital, and later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "fearful fear of revenge" and was concerned with "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement because of the alleged event she still has a severe trauma.
Ronaldo was just before the attack from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, after an agreement worth $100 million, he moved to the Italian great Juventus.
Brexit: United Kingdom "would regret forever" the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "be sorry forever" if after Brexit it lost the status of leading world car manufacturer, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK told the BBC that the UK's exit from the EU without an agreement would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border in the case of brexite without agreement could lead to job losses.
The Toyotina Burnaston factory produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement by the end of March, production in our factory has stopped,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyotin at Burnston.
Concern about how the EU's exit will affect cross-border trade without agreement has also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit, she would close her factory in Oxford in a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risk associated with the supply chain in the case of brexite.
Toyota's production line operates in accordance with the principle of "at the right time", with suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU coming for cars on order every 37 minutes.
If the UK of 29 March did not come out of the EU without an agreement, this could lead to an interference on the borders that the representatives of the panel say could lead to a standstill and a lack of work.
Toyota in her factory in Derbyshire could not co-ordinate for more than one day's work, the company's representatives said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said therese May's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly moderated to avoid such border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the present success, but to seize this opportunity," he told Today's BBC's Radio 4.
"The data not only toyote, but also other manufacturers are that we have to be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not comment on how long the production would have been stopped and warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the industry and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the United Nations trade union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "After my experience, the lost job never returns."
The government representative said: "We must present a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be "stopped for another week" because of the ongoing fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian pre-election interference, the links between Trump's staff and Russia and the potential President's obstruction of the judiciary.
The question is whether Trump will forgive the Attorney-General's envoy and thus threaten Mueller's independence, he's been drinking Washington's speech for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about the use of a hearing equipment for recording talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the President on the basis of Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On the last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of a report of his intention to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would rather not let go, and then they moved the meeting to avoid a conflict with the Senate's judicial committee, where they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump identified a one-week investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate's vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for her is not yet set. It could happen this week, depending on everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court, and it could be postponed in another week.
We'll see. I always love to make sure you're informed."
Some of the rapporteurs would argue on this, but Sanders has not been calling for a White House meeting with reporters since September 10.
The director of the show Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the frequency of meetings is not to be attributed to resistance to the "setting" of TV reporters, but she said: "You can't deny that they're putting up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more press conferences than any president before him," she said, adding without mentioning the source: "We have looked at the numbers."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can turn to the President of the United States with their question, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
This is what we are trying to do, and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why when he appeared simply and partially bizarre in front of the assembled journalists.
Letter from the EU Health Minister to the NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude to the State and to wish to continue the work after the brexith.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applying to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the outcome, as the decision came to a close in the autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also speeded up preparations for a possible outcome scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff regardless of his nationality.
Friends from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel at home in Scotland. We would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie emergency surgery after head injury
The senior supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christian Abercrombie, reported that after a head injury in the Saturday defeat at 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, Mike Organ reported the magazine The Tennesseen.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury had occurred only half an hour ago.
“He came to the edge of the playing field and somehow collapsed there,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel provided the Abercrombies on the edge of the toy with oxygen before being placed on the carrier and taken from the toy for further inspection.
An official from the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris from the channel WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie recovered after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘the details of the nature/range of the injury are not yet known’ and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a bridge at the University, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time after the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five hits together before leaving the game, and his total number of hits during the season was 18 hits.
A higher fee will be charged to foreign buyers when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
A higher fee will be charged to foreign customers when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralize Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Increased amount will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasurer expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, and she's going to use them to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher amount of property in the United Kingdom and the money collected will be spent on homeless people, theresa May will be reported today.
The move needs to be understood as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to increase the taxation of high-income persons.
The increased amount will be charged to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will encourage the government's efforts to eliminate homeless people.
The rate – which will be charged in addition to the current amount, including the increased levels, introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for delivery – could be nothing less than three percent.
The Foundation expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by the introduction of the measure.
According to estimates, the United Kingdom's non-Staters would purchase 13% of newly built London property, resulting in higher prices and a heavier purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities", as the number of customers who spend most of their time abroad is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
A large construction company has accused of rising prices by robbing a country that does not actually use it, and Mr. Mayevo has called for a discount for affordable housing in order to repair the British "refuse of housing."
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the termination of forced exiles without error.
In addition, he wants to give the city world more authority to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would devote my prime leader to restoring British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our inactive housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create their own lives.
It cannot be true, however, that for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, the purchase of homes is as simple as for British citizens.
For too many people, dreams about their own home are all too remote, and humiliation of homelessness remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run the club Scotland"
Chief Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is once to become the manager of the club of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East Club, which currently holds a third place in the First League, with three points less than the first.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer, after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season.
"For my country, I wanted to play as a player.
I received a B chapter, and that's what Ross said about BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“That’s when I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
I would only be offered this opportunity if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors on the front of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic team, who had previously rejected the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as a successor of such great names, he did not feel afraid.
“Success is measured by the question “Can I take this club back to the First League?”
According to the structure and capabilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but it'd probably be a success if the club could take it back there."
Ross is doing the manager's work only three years after he was the assistant leader of Dumbarton and 15 months of training staff at Hearts.
Alloi then helped to prevent the fall into the third league, and St. Mirren took the fall from the prey to the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” he referred to taking Alloe.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It's funny because it worked out good for me as a player, so I've lived pretty well with it and I've also achieved some more success.
But the game can become demanding.
Every week we have to face a lot of things.
In the sense of stress and pressure at work, I still struggle, but management just feels like the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to run a club and now I'm doing this. In my skin I feel more comfortable in my entire adult life now."

The summer heat has increased the revenues of heavy-duty British pubs, but the pressure on the restaurants has also increased.
In July, groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, the business adviser of the CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The constant solar time and participation of England in the world Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that in July he followed a similar pattern than in June last month, when the income of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were affected even stronger.
The drop in traffic in restaurants by 1.8% in June has increased in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased in comparison with each other more than traffic in restaurants has decreased.
Suntime also reduced sales in pubs that offer mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sales of alcohol increased by 6,6 per cent in one month and the sale of food decreased by three per cent.’
Paul Newman of the group of analysts for leisure and hospitality RSM said: “These results continue to be a trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The greatest factor in the sale of hospitality remains the time and impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that the group of restaurants continues to fight, although the fall of 4.8 per cent at the level of the year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For food owners in the long summer, it would not be possible to arrive at a more irregular time and only time will tell if recovery will be necessary to bring more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August."
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slow introduction of trademarks.

One of the five children on the social network has a secret account he hides from his parents
The research has shown that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — has a secret account on the social network that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 children showed the growth of false Instagram pages
News reinforces the fear of publication of sex-related content
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a “main” account for their parents
One of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — is actually a social network account that he hides from his parents.
A survey among 20,000 students showed rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news reinforced the fear of publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of pupils have said that they manage the censored “main” account shown to their parents, but also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into the secret side of a 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter invited visitors to strengthen her.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them are recognised as having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are subject to temptation and create a web space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Sports Committee
Elidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the Administrative Committee.
Doyle is the most outstanding Scottish athlete in the field and free and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who are targeting sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eildh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Communities. We are sure that athletes in Scotland with their involvement in the committee won a huge deal,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm happy to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help with sport management in Scotland."
A U.S. player who won the four Olympic medals in 1996 at 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator to BBC, has been unable to speak after a transitional ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a drop.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said he'd only tell me if I could recover to some extent.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I'm exercising for agility!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An ad for a breast pump comparing the mother with the cows has divided online opinions
The company producing breast pumps divided its opinions with an ad comparing the mother with the cows in cheese.
For the start of the ‘first silent transmission pump’ market, the consumer technology company Elvie published a provocative music video to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in a sheep's milk society filled with hay on a song that includes the following text: "Yes, I draw, but I don't see any tail," and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't my tits, these are my boobs."
The collection continues: "Exhaust, drain, feed the baby, drain, drain, crush the baby."
However, an advertisement published on Facebook's website has caused considerable contempt on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying that he was joking about the “great” dairy industry.
"The use of cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they are pregnant and breast-feeding to produce milk, but they are stolen by their babies in the first days after the slaughter," one wrote.

Another commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and young man.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, "Audience completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, and one of the women admitted that she thought it was a "drumpy" song.
"I think that's a great idea.
I'd buy it too if I were still breast-feeding.
I felt just like a cow when I was sucking.
The ad's a few crazy, but I understood it the way it was supposed to be.
It's a brilliant product," wrote the second.
Someone commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who exhaust their milk (often at work or at the toilet) and feel like cows."
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing with hidden pumps in the blue.
The concept of action is that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and is discreetly attached to the breast-feeding tube, allowing women to move, hold the child and even activities on the free during milk pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, continued to comment. "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation."
With the passing of parallel between women who suck milk, and cows milkers, we wanted to pay attention to the pumping of milk and all its challenges, while showing an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
That's not the first time Elvie's pump came to the headlines.
During London’s weekly fashion, the mother of two children walked on the model of Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of silent migrants moved to the tabernacle at the Texas border
The number of children held by migrants has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand the child over to sponsors.
It is traditional that most of the sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid to risk their own chances of staying in the country with the child's request.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to hand out fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, told the congress that the agency had arrested more than ten people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied adolescents.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or home members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and most of these are punishable foreigners.
That is why we continue our search for these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In order to address children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month after they were detained and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers said in the sanctuary.
Many will show up with a videoconferencing call, not personally, in order to defend themselves before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for aid will be quickly eliminated.
As long as children are in detention, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, as reported by workers in shelters and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Protesters have said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornill, where the signs of the child’s stress due to their size are likely to remain unattainable.
They added that moving children to the city of tents could be difficult, without making them emotionally ready or giving them the opportunity to speak to friends, making it difficult for many of them to deal with.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Mouale invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though war had been taking place in the country for eight years.
Moual, who also carries out the duties of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will also act accordingly".
“Unfortunately and unconditionally they must withdraw,” he said to the congregation.
Moualem said that "war against terrorism" was in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to be left at home, "almost finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on its territory in the war-distributed countries.
With regard to refugees, he told Moual that the conditions were appropriate for them to return, and he charged "some Western countries" with "spreading unreasonable fears" which convinced refugees to stay abroad.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return," he said.
"They are changing the political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive the means of renewal until Asad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a Tamponic Zone in the last important rebel platform, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented an extensive attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, from the province of three million people living in.
However, Moualem stressed that he had a clear deadline and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against the jihadists, including combatants from the Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaida, who would be "rooted".
A United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to prepare a military constitution for Syria and press the way for elections.
Moualem defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for its cooperation in the Committee, saying that the work of the Committee should be limited to "the review of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will reach another mandate
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win in the re-elections in 2020 unless, as many Liberals hope, his presidency will soon end with interpeltion and scandal.
What would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finals of the presidency at any time!"
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s visibility has doubled by more than 1.05 million at the time of the largest, while MSNBC’s visibility has almost tripled by 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time, which is more than four years ago after Nielsen, when it had 1.7 million, and the Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers at night on important news.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the leader of the drama “Designated Survival” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comic book writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few solid truths about choking in the Club of Hollywood Boys," offers a different explanation.
Remember to drive by taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd love Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovel told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what appears on television, the Washington story could decide on the future of Roe versus Wad, depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
It's a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged viewers.
However, the six-fold look at the round table of experts who are discussing the use of the source "from a deep background" for the book "Strah" Bob Woodward, $15,000 worth of fine jackets from a new leather (“dressed, thickly inflated,” said The Washington Post) and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Trump, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria again.
“The part of his beginning that inspires the impression of real performances is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars” on the event of the Trump Show and the daily events (twice with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you'll be in the background.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 degrees (26.7 °C) outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was confused inside watching MSNBC when he recorded CNN.
There was no way he could move away, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and hung in the air the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember that we were creating all these crazy plays at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money is made available in preparation for the narrowest interim elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, there was a flood of money, since two candidates were in the race for the same seat to reorganize the congressional districts.
This recently to the newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is the home of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily covered by the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January ruled that the old districts were counter-imposed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The theme in the new 17th district was the colour for funding the campaign between the main foreign financial bodies, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a wide-ranging March special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
In the U.S., they were thinking about sanctions against Salvador in support of China, and then they withdrew.
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting in June 2017 with President Juan Carlos Varelo and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners had lost the leadership of the Trump organization.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry have decided to resign from the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "the recent decisions on the cessation of Taiwan's recognition", said Heather Nauert, Ministry's representative at the beginning of the month.
However, they considered sanctions for Salvador, which was estimated to receive US$ 140 million in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including restrictions on financial aid and targeted restrictions on the issuance of visas, would seriously affect this Central American country with a high level of unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in preventing migration in the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, concluding their thoughts on the Salvadoran punishments.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of interviewing conference participants, who are now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government attaches to the meeting.
After that, three American envoys returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new solid messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about them on an anonymous basis.
Their testimony was confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government and also spoke about it under the terms of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The following unpleasant news could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is now very much evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller was also to investigate whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved with Russia in the attack on the American elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to these authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to speak again to his voters.
This is a lot of questions, and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long-lasting the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike Hitler if the West would resist him and support him in Munich.
We didn't make it, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the slaughter that followed.
Such breakthroughs alter the course of history and accelerate or impede the inexhaustible march of democracy.
The Americans are confronted with several of these breakthroughs right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump forgives Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has in his hands the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the year since this officer reported that he proposed a secret filming of the president last year and speculated about his incompatibility with this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the officer's report was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the requested investigation by the FBI Brett Kavanaugh will not be exhaustive or fair or if it will be appointed a Supreme Judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for the Congress which will require Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we're going to run into these trials, we're going to have to wait for the long winter democracy.
But I'm sure it won't be too late for us because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my emissary home.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and she ordered me 60 years later to burn a shabby candle at the toilet table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that they will be won over the Austrians after the impressive campaign against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month to give them a convincing position for qualification from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season before a 2:2 rhymes against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use it as a springboard for greater achievements.
“It was a worthy point for us because Villareal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
"We have entered the game to be sure that we can achieve something and take the point.
Maybe we could win at the end, but there's probably a fair result in general.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There will be another great European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I now have a good feeling about this place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Poor sleep of women because of fear of savings
Even though the pollers had a clear idea of how to care for them, only a few people would talk to their family members about it.
Half of the Nationalwide insurance survey respondents said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to children about it.
“People want a family member to care for them, but don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Life Insurance Sector at Nationalwide.
You can start in the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family for you if you don't talk to her in time.
Talk to the counselor and the family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in assessing the cost.
Include financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the transition.
Choose a health representative by setting up a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, the authorisation of a person for his finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down this information in the action plan to be prepared.
"It's not just about your finances. Do you know doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are you taking?
"Who's gonna take care of the dog?
I am ready for this plan."
In Ilfracom, a man was shot several times by an air rifle
A man who returned home at night was shot several times by an air rifle.
The shooter, at the age of 40, was in the vicinity of Oxford Grove in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Policemen described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 after British time, as "accidental action".
She didn't see the victim of her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, but the police have called for any witnesses to come forward.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, and the number of victims was to be increased.
At the time of the interruption of communication, rescuers from Dongala Regent, the area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5, could not obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake in Palu.
Some key data on Palu and Dongali in Slovenia:
Palu is the capital of Central Slovenia, the province that is located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavezi and is estimated to have 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached the province, extending more than 300 km (180 km) north-west coast of the island of Sulavezi.
Regents, the administrative unit under the province, were estimated to have 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the region of Central Slovenia are fisheries and agriculture, in particular in the central region of Dongal.
In the province there is also an important activity of nickel mining, which is mostly carried out in Moroval, on the opposite side of Slovenia.
After reporting to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Relief in the last 100 years, Pala and Dongalo have been affected by tsunamis several times.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongali.
In 1996 the tsunami also affected North Dongalo and resulted in the death of nine people.
Indonesia sits on an active Pacific firefighting meal, so earthquakes occur regularly.
In recent years, there have been some major earthquakes and tsunamis:
2004: The greater earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that affected 14 countries and resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Assessment, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The type of strong earthquakes affected Western Sumatra late March and early April.
More than a hundred people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of magnitude 6.8 affected the southern part of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, and triggered tsunamis that flooded its southern coast and caused nearly 700 people to die.
2009: The 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered tsunamis up to 10 meters high, which destroyed the ducate villages and caused death to about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake hit the Pide Jay Regent in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunamis did not start, but the buildings fell and killed more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok and resulted in more than 500 deaths, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily kept thousands of tourists.
Arresting Sarah Palin's oldest son for family violence
Track Palina, the oldest son of former governor and vice-presidential candidates Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
The 29-year-olds from Wasilla, Alaska, were arrested for summation of violence in the family, obstructing the application of violence in the family and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency reported on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin was aware that when he tried to call the police to report a alleged criminal offence, he took the phone from his hand.
The fire was arrested at the Mat-Su Precassional Institute and was detained under an unsecured guarantee of $500, reported the KTUU television network.
He appeared at the courthouse on Saturday, where he said he was "probably innocent" when asked about the objection, the network reported.
The fire was charged with three A offenses, which means that it could be closed up to one year and punished with a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and depth of 2000 USD.
The fuel of the crime is not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palina.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the application of domestic violence and possession of arms in an alcoholised state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin criticised the veteran groups when violent behaviour of her son linked to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Cunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are broken down, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just around central Sulavesia, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing a moment of earthquake.
When he hit the tsunamis on the coast, hundreds of people were detained at the festival in Pala on the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely require a death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York require a death penalty for Syfull Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died.
Saipov, 30, was intended to use the rental of a freight truck to carry out an attack on the bicycle road along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan when he drove several pedestrians and bicycles in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 's intention' killed eight victims and 'sagree' caused serious bodily harm, it is recorded in the notification of the death penalty claim filed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, there may be a reason for the death penalty for any of the charges.
For several weeks after the attack, Saipov's large federal court made a list of the charges in 22 points, which included eight counts for murder in aid for rape, which are usually used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and the charge for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and fastening", said prosecutors who described Saipov's way as "stupid, cruel and sophisticated."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to family and friend Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchija, Hernan Diego Mendoze and Alejandro Damiana Pagnuccoa," is recorded in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court of the South District pronounced the last death penalty ten years ago.
Indictant Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers and finally turned his sentence into a prison sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty in New York City was last pronounced in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had killed him because of a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union between the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg died at the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack, as stated in the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS video that he was watching on the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also said that they demanded an explanation of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
Regarding 22 counts of the indictment, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "evidently disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that a decision to request a death penalty instead of a confession of guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering in relation to these events”, Patton said.
Saip's defense group had previously asked the prosecutors not to require a death penalty.
For Brexit negotiations, NIGELA FARAGEA should be in charge, the former Member
Today, Nigel Farage, during a protest at the Tori conference, promised to "mobilize the human army".
Former leader of Ukipa said that politicians must "feel the warmth" of Europeans when one of his own Members, Theresa May, suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone said at the Birmingham event that the United Kingdom would "now be outside" if it were Secretary for the Brexit of Mr Farage.
But the challenge facing Mrs Mayev in coordinating her deep-separated species has also been highlighted by the thorists, who have given up Brexit, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his plan in check between the attacks of the Brexit proponents, the Brexit opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva in Brussels would try to reach an agreement despite opposition and force Europeans and labians to choose between their package and "caos".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Department means departure) assembly in Solihul that "he wants to get rid of the Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as a spokesperson and assign him the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
This Ambassador from Wellingborough added, "I will support the Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU with the following words: "We have not fought in world wars to be ministers now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposal that the public opinion since the 2016 vote changed: "The idea that the British have changed and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic."
At the meeting was also the Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins, who told the rapporteur: “I simply say: ‘The Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan in general is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our customers and our activists who are active on the streets and even lead us to the election.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mr. Mayev, she added: "The prime minister keeps his job when he fulfills his promises."
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that policy should be given a "hotness" if they intend to issue a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to release the brexite, and we're meeting today to say, 'We won't let you do this.'
In the message, the enthusiastic crowd added: "I want you to give our political class, which is on the edge of the Brexit issue, a feeling of warmth."
"We are mobilizing the human army of this country, which has provided us with the victory of Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the reindeer walked through Birmingham, where they had a court meeting in the city center.
After the group was set up this weekend, a handful of activists with the Torian flags against Brexit.
The Laburist noble Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because of security problems with the application of the party after the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for the Canada agreement plus, for the border without restraints, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a perfect farce.
There is nothing like good brexite," he added.
Warren's possible move for the president's position will "research carefully"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will be studying "cooperation in the presidential election" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will compete for the re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trump election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation so that it can meet the Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters as a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to negotiate for the president's place.
Warren's reply is that it's time for "the crime of a woman in Washington to repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of the player LSU Sims in the shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested a suspect on Friday to shoot LSU Wayd Sims' basketball player.
The Baton Rouge police station reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at the 11 a.m. press conference.
They posted a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help in identifying the person on the video.
Twenty-year-old Sims were shot and killed early Friday near the campus of the South University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head shot and died as a result,” said Murphy J. Paul police chief to the media, reported the 247 sports network.
Wayde got involved in protecting a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without support and taken to the police station East Baton Rouge Paris Police Department.
Sims, 198 centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season with 10 beginnings, on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion, and the team ordered him to leave Sebastian Vettl to win.
On Saturday it became the moment that Valtteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it is clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong influence on the race".
Bottas began well on the shore and almost left Hamilton in the dry when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettl to attack his master's colleague.
Vettel took the first one in the box and let Hamilton drive on the traffic rope, which should be decisive.
Mercedes led the box later and left it behind for Vettl, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the Ferrari's inflexibility left the inside side open and risked that after two defence moves in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last kind of network and was at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in the seventh place.
Then most of the game was without changing the tires, as he intended to make a quick finish, rush Kimi Raikkonen and hit the fourth place.
He finally led the boxing into the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase his speed, so Raikkonen occupied the fourth.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri's a fantastic vehicle all weekend and he was a real knight when he let me through.
The team did a really great job to reach the first and second places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speaker.
President Donald Trump laughed at the meeting on Saturday, Senator Diana Feinstein, because of her insistence that she did not reveal Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch Ford's testimony before the Senate's investigative commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "wicked, corrupt and false".
“The only nice thing that can happen that has happened in the Senate in the last days, that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
"When you look at the revelations and the revelations, people say, 'No, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do that."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it.
Okay, hold on a second.
We discovered it... No, we didn't," he added with regard to the impression of the senator.
Ford's letter with details about the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July and the media was released in early September – but Feinstein's refusal to come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusation, I didn’t reveal her letter,” the officer of The Hill Feinstein told the commission.
"She asked me for trust and I kept her as confidential as she asked."
Her refusal apparently did not fit the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, this was a really bad body speaker.
It may not be true, but it was the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
In defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of improper sexual conduct, the President suggested that democracy abuse the charges for its own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen wickedness, hatred, no concern to them, who are affected and who have to be driven to fight to power and control," the President should say after reporting the Mediate website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer killed two goals for the Greats against Dundee.
Dundee Stars were redeemed for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants with a victory in the Saturday match in Dundee at 5:3.
The Giants soon scored two goals at Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were comparing the home side, and then Dwyer again gained the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard compared it to Dundee before two naked Lundvald Nielsens gave them a victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elitna League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee from behind on Friday night at 2:1.
This was the fourth season meeting between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three matches.
Dwyer reached his first goal in the game in four minutes at 3:35 at Kendall McFaull's assistant, Beauvilleer, who won four minutes later, and gave up David Rutherford.
In the intensive introduction at 13:10 Sullivan again led to the game home page, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowni the equation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the leader of the Giants on vacation when at the end of the first third he scored his second goal of the evening.
The home page gathered again, and Bouchard recovered the remnant with a violent naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped together that Nielsen led Dundee ahead at the end of the second third and took care of the fifth goal of his team of half and took care of the fifth goal of his team of half of the last third.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games now, will play the next game on Friday home in Milton Keynes.
With his death, the air traffic controller enabled more than a hundred people on the plane to escape the earthquake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia celebrate as a hero, after sacrificing his life so that the plane could fly safe with hundreds of people.
In the Friday earthquake on the island of Sulavezi, followed by the tsunamis, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to be under stress by powerful storms, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Pala.
Although the employees fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his workplace in a powerful flying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Pala.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight path, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision might have saved more than a hundred lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another town.
Sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our heart is in the market when we hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could reach more than a thousand, as the accident relief agency in the country said that access to the city in Dongala, Sigia and Boutonga was limited.
“The number of dead is going to increase, as there have been many bodies under the ruins and many of us have not been able to reach them,” said Sotopo Purwo Nugroho's representative.
The Pale, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves, high to six meters.
Military and commercial aircraft shall provide assistance and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the rescue vehicle brings the body.
It lacks clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross hits to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It is already a tragedy that can get a lot worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Pala and told the national army: “All of you, I ask you to work night and day to fulfill all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?» After reporting to CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronese Air Force Heading: Air Niugini Air now says that one person is missing after the aircraft heading in the lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says they miss one person after first reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the submerged aircraft.
Air Niugini announced on Saturday afternoon that a missing male passenger was missing.
The airline was told that local authorities, hospitals and investigators were involved in the search for the missing person.
At a call for more information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality, they did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water when they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the officers said they had taken seven people to the hospital.
The airline said that there were eight passengers who were all in stable condition at the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of dizziness and the exact order of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane arrived in the lagoon just ahead of the track.
Some witnesses said the plane was missing the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had dropped very low.
"That's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to get through the water flowing through to the belt to the power outlets on a diving plane.
He said that the stewards were panicking and screaming, but he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that even the sailors who had repaired the bridge in the vicinity had been helped by the use of an inflatable boat with which people were transported to the ground before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in the last two decades of air accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst set the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in a retrial to a man who was accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
An analysis by the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone footage to determine the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Telllis and Chambers were on the eve of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers at the time he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said that he was "lying because he was [my] truck in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The photos on the phone show that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had erased Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone at the time after Chambers died.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence is to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury should judge the trial later this day.
The High Breed: What's a Conscious hippop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that the hippop has distanced itself from the original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and make a conscious hippop popular again.
In the United Kingdom, artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently experienced a new rise with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
The New York security guard sues a couple because they fired her because of a "racist" message
The New York guard is suing a couple because they have discriminated against her after receiving the wrong message sent by the mother, who complained that she was "one black."
A couple reject racist behaviour and the complaint is compared to "enforcement".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when Giselle Maurice discovered that she was a black woman at the time of the arrival of the new guardian.
“NOEEEEEEEE is a black woman,” said Plasco-Faxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to his husband, she sent him twice to Mr. Maurice.
After finding her support, the Plasco-Faxman, who felt “unsatisfied”, fired Maurice’s, saying that her leaving guard, who was an African American, was doing a bad job, so he wanted to hire the Philippines, reported New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she and Uber were sent home.
Maurice now claims compensation from a couple in the court, which is $350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was first hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, such things don’t happen,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “I know that this is discrimination.”
A couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that Maurice’s forgiveness was reasonable, fearing that they would no longer be able to trust her after the tragedy.
"The wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband to Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were cruel to, even if that happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.’
When comparing the complaint with ‘emigration’, Plasco said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
"Are you going to stand up to someone like that?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although proceedings are still pending before the Court, the Court of Public Opinion was quick to condemn a couple on social networks because of its conduct and way of thinking.
The storytellers of the bear Paddington were afraid that readers would not associate with the talking bear, a new letter revealed
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put herself in the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an exceptional success."
She said that her father, who first worked as a cameraman for BBC, before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little bear playing, was bitter when he refused his work, added that last year after his death she was the 60th anniversary of the book "Granco-sweet".
Regarding a bear named Paddington, described as “very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
"There was this man who didn't like to praise himself," she said.
“But since the bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if something had reached your child: You are proud of him, even though you are not really doing it by yourself.
I think he was looking at the success of a bear named Paddington in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed success to the bear Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the time, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to preserve her life.
“She regularly called to say that she felt really bad that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got Nad's call. He told me that in the next two minutes he was going to die, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to continue to pump her heart, slowly took her and left her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a position to be surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who was already complaining about the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who were not aware of the trials she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down and all the time there was tears on my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he liked her."
Grieving women's sticky posters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide try to turn others away to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valiant Point of Beauty posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mr. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel like I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a founding smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They have always said that his smile has brightened every room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his partner when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm gently worried that the domain effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters "to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit quietly – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who was Davies' friend for several years, lost Marka, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling sweaty, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the presents, he did not establish eye contact with them or anything like them.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma to them, but they had to process it: “She cut the hole into the whole family.
She broke us up.
But we must continue and fight."

Future of Brett Kavanaugha hangs at the start of the FBI Air Survey
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – after the duration and extent of a limited investigation, this might be a point for us,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the world would fall apart because of a solid foreign presence.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
By the mid-elections that will take place on 6 November, there will be only five more weeks – if, as expected, the Republicans cut off badly, this will greatly weaken them when they try to elect a wanted person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senator several times to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, who was presented by this present wife, Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can gather at least 50 votes, which would bring the coup from the position and election to the Supreme Court by Mike Pence, Vice-President.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un arrived in power seven years ago, the South Korean envoy said.
Byeong-seug Park, referring to the data from the South Korean Association Ministry, said that 1127 people fled last year compared to 2706 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factor was more stringent border control between North Korea and China and the increase in the price required by people's bats.
Pjongang has not yet commented on this.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to reach than a heavily secured demilitarized area between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South – which are technically still in the war – has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongang for talks that focused on stopping denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kimo Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean nuclear-weapon-free half-world.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the U.S. sanctions to a standstill ever since.
"Without trust from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, but in such circumstances we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a statement from the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi described Bretta Kavanaugh as “hististic” and said that it was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the representative's home Nancy Pelosi appointed a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh as "hististic" and said that she was significantly inadequate for the service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosius said so in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman would, if she did so, be labeled “hysterical”,” Kavanaugh’s Thursday testimony to the Senate Investigation Commission commented on Pelosiev.
Kavanaugh openly denied charges of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost drowned in the discussion about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Commission and blamed himself for the "gross and coordinated mutilation" organised by the liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosius said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be appointed a Supreme Judge, since it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I believe that he has discredited himself with such statements and the way in which Clinton and the Democrats have been shot," she said.
Pelosia is asking whether she will try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and democracy gets most in the House of Representatives, for the moment it has become.
“I will say so – if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which it is now,” Pelosiev said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosia said that, as a democrat, she was concerned about any Kavanaugh decision against the Health Care Act available or Roe's case against Wad as a conservative judge.
In its confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether to annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" said Pelosius.
And they have to blow the woman.
It's a fair outcome, after months and years of rage, and it can't express it without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," she told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, what do you think?"
She continued: “I was very helped by a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed the technique, which is when she got angry and started to cry, the person she was talking to said, ‘I may feel sorry for you because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was great."
Tears are partly allowed as an outcome for anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career, when I was still working in a office where men were ruling, once I felt crying in irrevocable anger, was the occasion when an older woman grabbed me by the neck — a cold leader who was always a few balls that dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They won't understand that you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to have you touched."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Harta was boarded on board a boat named Monkey Business and had to get out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder deeply regretted that there was no reason why she could not run for the president alone.
“It wasn’t well thought out,” she said 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already participated in the game and one more thing was needed at the time.
At that time, someone called the “Sneegle and seven thumbs.”
As the campaign joined the last one, it was delayed in the collection of funds, and it was decided that it would not enter the game unless it had raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in the discussion that she would not start an official campaign, her feelings — thanking the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to collect money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — were so oversmoothing that she began to die.
"They would think I had a nervous breakdown," said Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the media.
"They'd think my official sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my graveyard.
“But she was crying?”
How the U.S.-China War Can Use Beijing
The initial salons of the U.S.-China trade war were listening, and although the battle has not yet ended, experts say that the gap between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, initiated the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs for goods worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which effectively means taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has always been vengeful of equivalent reimbursement measures, at least at rates of between 5 and 10 per cent per US commodity of USD 60 billion.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed itself to moving her eye with the United States and is likely to not be intertwined soon.
In order to be able to give up Washington, China should agree to its demands, but the US's public removal for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knew how to pull the right move, US pressures in the trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic crisis in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a professional collaborator focusing on Asia at the Center's brain trust for new American security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and asks for assistance in rebuilding the country that has been abandoned for more than seven years.
In a statement from the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas that were destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now all conditions have been met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to be abandoned because of terrorism and foreign economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said he would welcome the Syrian regime's help in restoring the desolate state.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and Ryder's castle has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed for victory over the United States.
The American star Phil mickelson, who had problems through most of the championships, threw a ball into the water at the 16th hole in a couple of 3 games at his initial hit, which led to the game being handed over to Francesco Molinaria.
Italian golfer Molinari shined across all circles and became one of four players who ever since the beginning of the championship in the form of 1979 achieved the result 5-0-0.
U.S. Jordan Spieth won the lowest ranking European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played in Ryder's polo last.
The veteran of the eight Ryder races, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the most successful European player of all time since 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It was hard this year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, I'm so happy that we won the prize again.
It is a team and I am really glad that I was able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The staff handed over to his cousin John Ram, who, on Sundays 2 and 1, won the American Gulf of Tiger Woods.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France and now has a career record in Ryder's 13-21-3.
This is unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 major titles, right after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying hard all week to find the right way, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing golf at a high level.
The U.S. captain said after a bad performance for his team: "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we pushed a few things into Europe for a moment.
We're down.
The club's down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will have to gather again, I will work with the American association of PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move on.
I really like these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Get down.
They have overpowered us."
