No Free Novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to abolish the paragraphs on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced under a novel of the Penal Code.
The new arrangements which could have opened the way for the release of the detainee minister, the Members rejected the second reading of the application for the suspension of the fines for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a allegedly harmful agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid; in December the appeal of the judges is to be brought before the court.
Timoshenko himself referred to the judgment as the political root of the regime, and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the pre-accession of the court.
The application, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of State was sentenced to withdraw from the Penal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Dinar
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, in the Islamic elections, the question is which - the moderate or the radical ones.
The National Transitional Council has become known as the ordinary right of Sharí
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft, you will soon have to cut off your hand.
Women should also forget about emancipation as quickly as possible, and possibly faith-based, and so forth.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Quran from each other.
In short, in Libya there will be an order that would be less predictable and, above all, less desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objectively seen, perhaps not the best and would hardly fit the differences mentioned by the Libyans.
In this way it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were able to help themselves from the unbelieving dogs at all.
To excuse them, it must only be the fact that NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America but by God himself, whose power was praised after every successful hit.
The winner in Libya? The west doesn't belong to it.
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians separated themselves from the person of the dictator of a political ally without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to look away from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the hostages are concerned - namely, the spread of the crusaders.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without the occupation?
It is hardly possible that the West can at last boast itself once with the right of its independence in matters of protecting human rights.
If this doesn't destroy the Sharri-a representatives.
The start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
However, the bond market is running all the records today.
The investors not only retain Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, which is by 0.4% from France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France recorded a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data were only from stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analyst's predictions.
The most important events are:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal figures, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the euro area as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy dropped by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from its 10-year state bonds is 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish State bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to experience problems...
The return on Czech State loans is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, votes will be taken, and the ECB will become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-established Torwarts Czech and a magnificent tower by Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from home game and will not be missed again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a giant portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection was also successful thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happily 1:0 and has thus redeemed her ticket for the football-EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they could only put the Montenegrins more under pressure in the second half.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giants.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be joined next year at the European Championships, and it is also happy that the home football will win a prize of about 200 million.
From the first minute on, it was played quite combat football.
Both teams were combined for a long time and were played around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, too, the pressure of the home team continued, and the extensive clashes before the fine were successfully rejected by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred high school students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a living shield around the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
So they wanted to make sure that they were ready to protect their country's core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up its nuclear weapons efforts.
In Israel too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed on the afternoon before entering the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack carried out on the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press in Isfahan said that the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan’s attack was also the target.
The food card of a fat-like child: It does not breakfast and eats for the evening break
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys show - adipic children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important it is for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipic children, herbs are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had on the eve of the lighting action under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" Pommes for the evening break.
Even in families with dickers, sports is not exactly the favorite jobs, however, as the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find themselves at least once a week time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year against the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools being questioned throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not an accident", supported by the General Hospital and the Society Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy costs and lack of movement within the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the fearsome increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children in question, for example, started eating breakfast-second breakfast dinner dinner five times a day - one of the main requirements for healthy nutrition," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and toast for the evening break
Experts point out that also relatively small things, such as regular family breakfast, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of the students eat breakfast.
And - in most families each breakfasts for himself.
The worst was the finding that in every ten families there was no breakfast at all.
The breakfast is considered the cornerstone of healthy daily food.
The survey revealed, among other things, the fact that many of the families of overweight children are consumed with poorly healthy potatoes.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children in question are driving sports, only less than half of their parents are doing so - that is only 15 percent.
Put your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to gather from the possibilities offered for their own food plan according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in a food point is far from the ideal for healthy food.
Among their favorite foods were many flours, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"Almost alarming is the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report stresses this survey.
At lunchtime, that is to say, the main court, flours were almost in front of birds.
The children almost disliked fruit and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they receive correct information.
"In many cases, a clear shift in preferences to the principles of healthy nutrition was to be recorded in the results of the project in the questionnaire following the conclusion of the explanatory lecture "Adipositionas is not an accident".
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed a lot of frequent wings or fish in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less garlic or sweet food.
Profis claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article on how to learn stylists, I had a bit of a taste that it was a little too much substance for the beginning.
I didn't realize what was going on.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this "in place" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination takes place, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully documented.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (the course does not involve a single man) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
And that's always the most of us.
They have one too short neck, the other one too young figure without proper curves and again others are mollible.
It is the matter of the stylist to cast wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to exorcise the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large buses, wide hips and narrow sizes - pretty and figure concrete without acting too provocative.
For example, if the difference between sizes and hips is so large that the rock or pants really do not fit, you should be able to cut at least one piece to the extent.
You will certainly not regret this, for good sitting clothes are simply unpaid.
In such a tailor-made rock, you feel much better than in one of the bars, which is always too high and twisted, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can again allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, stickers or scraping.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am happy that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to create in the light of the house assignment.
Each of the students was awarded a prom for which they should think about suitable outfits - day clothing and abstinence.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm going to "draw" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from Victoria's secret campaign.
I am delighted inside because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to 100 kilos in recent times (well, this is a bit overcrowded), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut the clothing from magazines or search, print and then edit graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to reflect also on the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only draws the models purely physically, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to a specific default, such as trend handbags, gloves, etc.).
The designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's only on Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday presentation, filled with information on types of figures, was issued by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorny, by the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And sent-in stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a very different way.
The magic word is variable.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat like usual over the Jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear paragraph shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to raise the sleeves or the collars and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
Mostly, however, I found the following advice: "You must first know the rules perfectly."
"Before then you may hurt her," said Jacob.
Finally, I will understand why we have to cook all these teachings, what you can combine with, and why, even if you often get a whole different look in fashion journals.
To be quiet from fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you need to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to stylize at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks quite different among them than in reality.
So with all of this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That the image and style among them make up half of the success, which confirmed us also Jan Pokorny.
There you only need Madonna to look at a not just brilliant singer, made out of the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also well-known personalities often hold this for out-of-court money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if anyone of us is able to stylize, then we should assume that he or she is very likely to force us to a completely different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you just need to go online to find out for sure that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has returned or withdrawn, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only focuses on fashion and then the outfit needs to be "co-builded".
In his work he must first communicate with the people he stylizes and must be a waved psychologist.
People appreciate it without offering themselves and standing up to it.
"If any manager orders us to look at their wardrobe and add nice pieces, then we can't remove the whole cabinet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "plattasse" must include.
So that's a bag that's attached to the waist where you carry all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scars, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains tools such as a nylon thread (to help the stylist in photographing products, such as handbags or boxes), special clips with which the clothing is thrown back if it is too large (stick needles or other adhesives are prohibited so that the fabric is not cut) and of course a noodle.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to tie shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just above the floor, you can damage the shoe sole, keep it out.
We sticked and we stick...
Don't even touch the shoes with the scarf so you don't hurt them.
So you really have to go ahead.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The said skill is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we got at the second weekend continuation course.
One has now become clear to me - to dedicate yourself to the styling at professional level is not a child's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
Originally carefree driving becomes a series of completely avoidable, dilettant error in the routine to the breakfast level.
Although it has been achieved to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what benefits have been achieved if no one apparently wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the Ladensk, the new part raised high expectations with the title "The Run".
However, he promised to move again the old series "Need for Speed" into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the appropriate passages fall, in which the main protagonist rises from the car and goes on foot.
But as you're used to NFS, in the end, it's a lot different than you expected.
Safe - potentially there are quite decent arcade races, but in total the game is grounded by some superfluous errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible failure of game developers in principle.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, it is introduced into history whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is to say, on the west coast, you are on the left-hand side - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will take place on another route and that the individual stages will take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don't have a moment of the impression that the game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing worldly.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep-cut landscape seems very pleasant.
Over and over, untypical elements bring a little change in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts sight.
In the mountains again, you have to make sure you don't get caught up in a maze.
In addition, the individual races are well built together.
Just a few, but they're rich.
For a while you try to pick up the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are involved in. They want to get the whole thing mixed up.
A novelty is passports where Jack leaves the car.
This is rather about certain interactive animations in which Jack runs ahead of someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (specifically only three).
Finally, this is more of a benefit, because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it is one of the elements mentioned above that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps in the feet of the previous parts.
That means, from today's point of view, it doesn't grow out of trees, on the other hand, you couldn't say it would be bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations needs to look elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be well-balanced, although competition could be better.
Until then, everything is fine.
Real problems only arise after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it calculates complicated distortions and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea of how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When you take a close look or take a lead in competing cars, you "run" the other cars in some places only easily, in others, almost identical situations, but you get into a sleuder and turn wild pirates.
Or the car will drive straight to scrape.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't make it any more, it's all upset.
The restarts are solved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then one throws the game back to the last stop of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
If you've exhausted it, it's all going to go away.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work out, but you shouldn't leave it.
Sometimes, however, it doesn't even help restarting, because it doesn't help anything but learning the critical section from the head.
It is said that the same things often happen at the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to be run in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit in.
Otherwise, you will always meet with the appropriate place for "civil" cars in the same configuration, no matter whether you come as the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see the contraaant passing before a player on two matching cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to walk them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes close to this situation in front of your nose.
The contractors still have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where one is always caught up in the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The craziest thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The contractor must obviously get out of here on the devil.
And then if he's already in front of one, then he'll naturally take a look, so you can start driving your own car a few times in Klump.
Of course - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it will soon lose its joy in the game.
And that's too bad, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is all quite entertaining and, rather, so action is also loaded that you almost don't know where one of the heads are anymore.
And in principle it doesn't matter what's "debt" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't take long, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
You can't ignore the tanks on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases you have enough car you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super-sports for technical journeys, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of play history also goes the task mode (heretical challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (heretical challenges) and history.
To reach the higher driver level, different items must be closed: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares the results achieved with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible cuttings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come with the car into a subway tunnel (mineway) where you stay on the rails in the dark for a long time (mineway).
On the tacho look figures between 150 km and 200 km/h (mine roads), but then comes a subway from the back and leads a compromise-free.
In our editorial we will probably still argue about whether it was a blackout of the game designer or whether the authors kept us so bloody.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
The more angry it is that in some exciting moments, the image repeat frequency becomes slower and this amongst them is rather dramatic.
However, this concerns accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit at all.
The sound play is so much O.K. and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In an effort to address as wide as possible a scale rather young audiences, a soundtrack a la "of everything" was created - but who already buys such a game because of music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game wasn't grounded by the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we would have claimed with the breast tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems to be incomplete.
A class of pleasure for yourself, but one should be prepared to look into one of these errors with the power of airport broadcasters.
Concert of the "Students of the Joint Revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversity
The Festival Festa Academy now offers for the third time the world student day with the anniversary of the official revolution and this as well as musical experience.
In the course of the festival, they present themselves to the twenty-one professors of professional and higher education.
The festival focuses on the two concerts that will take place on 17 November.
"The Karls University has a large share in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanist Studies is also represented among the participants, and the director Václav Hampl is also present in the festival committee," said the head of the team, Jakub Čaloun.
The festival's absolute highlight is the public concert of academics, which will take place on 17 November at 14 a.m. in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazz Karel Rožička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings the concert "Students of the Sametu Revolution" (Studenty Sametu) is held in the gallery of the Vinohrady People's House, where there are also high-school choirs, not excluded from the audience of Karls University.
Festa Academy aims not only to celebrate the world student day and remember the 22nd anniversary of the official revolution, but to present public chorus music at the highest level and to promote creative cooperation among young people.
The main organizer is the association of Czech choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital of Prague and Václav Hampl, took over the entire event.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
In addition to concerts, the programme includes numerous music meetings, student events, matinees and other events.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the individual institutions to a level playing field."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the roads are smoothed down and everyone has become accustomed to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her presentation at the Faculty of Law.
As she is serious about taking the term "intellectually and openly over Europe", she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she was able to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could have benefited so many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new Permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning criticism was heard that he was too infallible - a grey official who had not been raised such a role, but I have to say, it has struck everyone's breath, as he took the matter well.
"He is a man who is ready to listen patiently to seven and twenty Member States to communicate with them and who has, above all, clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is an important step towards agreeing and improving the readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil mill Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lived and remembered to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial and gas crisis and also held the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency meant that it was a major negative which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU now has to do with all its hands.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, that was quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether there will be a slim and savingsier budget, which gives economic priority, which countries are more and which are less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "I understand about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's ugly shorts, foreign words and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I know, as a citizen, whether you really think of krum or round gorillas and different big bananas in Brussels or whether someone really wants to ban us.
It would have liked to use the EU's soil to obtain more checks in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics, which are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in the European institutions is much more angry.
Many factors are due, including the withholding of our candidates whose inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
Apart from the successful Czech Presidency, she also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which stands out so V4.
"Do you believe me when a Pole or Hungary comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the French thinks next to me: "Hey, what are you up to here? This is your V4 again?" and making a pretty acid mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects, above all, strict rules for budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more real, as a "European Federation", it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only the countries that want it and those that do not want it should stand quietly."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will eventually emerge from a strong "Europe of different speeds", Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also welcomed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in implementing the principle, according to all the issues affecting the EU as a whole, and not only the euro area countries.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters into the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most precisely, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, but it is known as a modern company, although it has been long since its establishment.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first chief - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the slogan that countless world problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a mark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time as the title of the company magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture which was thoroughly prepared by Watson.
"For us from IBM this long-term thought means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else around.
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, to transform technologies, business and society.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director for the anniversary.
Translucent system
Watson has worked in social care for his employees in the 1930s - in a similar way as did the entrepreneur Batàa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid leave, an insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well thought-out pay system for the best newers and traders.
The long-term relationship between IBM and its customers is also elusive.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and could therefore choose.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at the top of IBM next year is a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far it has taken the position of the head of the vetting, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstorms over the last few years, many of which have developed future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company is almost half a million people employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Its unscrupulous position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had rather the concept of an institution than just a technology company," said the economist, professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference whether it is only on the market to be present or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue", has grown to one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds most patents and has already been awarded the Nobel Prize to five of its employees.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, strike codes or even the diskette.
With about 220 billion dollars of stock exchange value (market capitalisation) IBM was the second largest technology company (just after Apple) this year, which it has been overcoming Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Preview
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, they were trying with their own OS/2 operating system, online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't relate emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who in principle stands and falls with his Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
IBM’s winnings are mostly services, software and hardware participate in one fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware with more than 50% of it was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold a small amount of winning assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments IBM continues even after 2008 when the recent financial crisis for the first time seemed like a storm around the world.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the authority of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the middle of the global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis undamaged.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company's returns are constantly growing.
The company logo of IBM says: everything can change - just not the values.
That is why this flexible giant can be expected to win the next crisis.
IBM History: From Case Cutting to World All Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded hundreds of years ago had a fairly complicated name - Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was accepted only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They have technologies such as the famous slot clocks for recording the beginning and end of work.
To the architects of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who had also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competition firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name has already spoken, with the production and distribution of all possible machinery for trade - from barley and cheese cutters to cashiers.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was in charge for forty years, only then he was discharged by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM’s technicians and computer of NASA helped guide flights to all - to Mercury and Saturn and also to the famous flight of man to the moon in 1969.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and went into full business with high added value consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It incorporates the intention to use technologies wisely in previously unplanned areas, for example to improve traffic and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM has recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform to help traders run the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM established a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and here is also a world-level top research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Richtářová about her unfaithful cats:
Iveta - this ass you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Richtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Joseph Richtář (53) became their lover by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still had the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has set clear rules.
"Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Richtářová, the singer I. Bartošová, had offered refuge in her own house, she probably wouldn't even have fallen into the dream, as she did with her husband.
When Iveta went back out after 30 days and went back to Ríčany, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even knew publicly that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, yes, it seemed as if she wanted to make peace with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly receive not open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, confused old ass, but as a person to whom I still have some ties," said Mrs. Richtářová; she also said that she had already been emotionally separated from him and existed alone on mutual resistance.
The fact that Darina has secured him the back door is still worth it.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I'm perfectly normal, but we don't share the bed," said J. Richtář (the blade) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take every responsibility.
The worst women's troubles: How are you?
If men are urged to call some typical female insults, then they will without exception shoot some prompts out of the sleeve.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines in which we let a couple of unsatisfied revisions happen again, which let men shed the blood in the veins?
Buying
Do you suggest to them that you be greedy for money?
Do you have to buy at least one hate every week?
Would you like to go shopping and can there be a little more in action?
Well, then it's really a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their purchases under control.
But hand over to the heart, which woman already insists on trying to get a good-looking dress just like that by a dress shop and not just try out all of them (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though buying for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how often they've already told her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I had to take at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Are they aware of this?
Yeah?
Then you may also belong to women who are legally possessed of what they look like.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly unbearable.
First order and purity
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, fold the times - and this at least twice a week.
Throw your partner back with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, shake the children, because the newly torn wash basin is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where the polishing makes so much effort?
If you are suffering under this kind of "devianz", then you should know that you must not overstep anything and that the order and cleanliness in your family life are not at first.
Finally, this immeasurable cleansing fin can also damage mutual relations and, above all, peace in the family.
Sketch
"Shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-shit-s
"Would you really like to pull the old socks again tomorrow?"
"We don't just throw a towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyranny, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, that's not bad, but they just want everything that's in order.
If the men knew this, then maybe the women didn't need to make that much.
Clastic and Tratsk
Some women would like to chat and chat, where they are switched behind their back or even spitting or dirtying.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to talk about such issues as who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Well, every woman of us has a bit of a shady clutter and a Tratsch in the camp.
Hand over the heart - that's probably all the women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with the greatest calibres of clutters, whose nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and who pose a significant danger to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their assistance to victory
The ice hockey storm Jaromír Jágr played the NHL on Monday with two assistants in the 5:3th victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added another assistance and was called out to the best player in the match, was a user of the review of the nine-and-a-half-year ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also listed Jágr's partner Jakub Voráček.
Jagr claimed after the game of journalists that he has a great evening prophecy.
"Even before the game, I tell him he's got a hate trick today."
I felt that way somehow."
"He and again overcomes such a feeling," Jágr explained, after which Giroux had already reached a door at the first shot of the pilots.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech mark".
Voráček won the puck behind the door of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the fall of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer reached a short handle, but the second third belonged to the flyers again.
It's just Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr, he achieved his third match, followed by Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the League, but of course he's one of the best three," Jagr praised his center.
"I wouldn't fall into life if I were to play with such an ice hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm so glad."
"I cut off my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my partners put their game on me and now the spear is turning around," cried Jágr.
Carolina was still playing the drama - through the hit of Tuoma Routua and once again Dwyer, who was released from a criminal prison, came to a door.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in too many two against a success.
"Excellent performers still working in our area."
"He took the puck, I took the ride and (read) moved to more distant postposts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it hit," Voráček described the party's last hit from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech opponent of Montreal Jaroslav Špatak was injured in the game against Buffalo and separated in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experience, the Candians also offered Beck their leadership an unforgivable shot at the Penalty 2:3.
One of the penalties could not change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the trainer of the home team probably the high sickness result in the defensive - the game they played only with five opponents at the end.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we only played with an experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done to get us done," said Jacques Martin.
"In any change, one wave of attack after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We would have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
Here there were still reservations," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech Torhüter Ondřej Pavelec held off thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5nd victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended up a series of five defeats, five different shields were involved.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state travel offices in the former ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
At that time the travel offices sold only trips to the socialist eastern bloc countries, in the West only allowed them to be selected.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotchi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when you were allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia started a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries of the East Block (also the Czechoslovaks).
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel to Poland individually or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then they had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel office, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
Even so, the thing hasn't been going on for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange issue - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to spend the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, most Czechs spent their vacation in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekends and desks - a habit that continues to this day.
The combined 1989 revolution followed a re-evolution of the Czechs on foot.
While by 1989 there was a holiday in the DDR or in Bulgaria the size of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A powerful paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that you could not travel in the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 90s last century, the foreign currency obligation was abolished in the neighbouring Western European countries, leading to a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their journey to the west for a long time, each wanted to be there for at least a few days.
This is how the Czech holidayers slept when traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because at that time who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature when travelling abroad from Czechs was a container, beer and permanent garden, etc. full-packed suitcase room.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free exchangeable Czech krone - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency free.
Our standard of living, and this has also increased the averages, which in 1997 gave rise to another important moment.
Due to increased demand for travel, after 1997 travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights, thereby allowing flights to negotiate numerous discounts, which were incredibly approved compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had the currencyless payment traffic with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-total" travel came in the year 2000, when due to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying every year in distant sunny countries; this year they fly directly from Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel in exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the epoch, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States raised the visa requirement for Czech tourists, thereby finally entering our country under the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 TZK per head for a single holiday holiday including the costs at the holiday place.
The main meeting is to find a new president - again threatens a pact.
For almost five months now, the Czech football has no chairman and threatens that Ivan Haszek's successor will not even be known at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburg.
To this day, there is no agreement on which electoral order is to be chosen.
And without it there is no vote at all on the three potential successors.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rijkl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paklík.
In June, Haszek withdrew from his position, urging his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Haszek did the old sources break out again between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This turned out to be sharp and clear on 16 September when the new president should be elected.
The delegates of the main meeting had come to the People's House in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the negotiations did not lead to any results and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in full - only the statutory representatives or also the officials with full power.
In this single point, at least part of the agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was not held on the basis of a delegation of power.
However, disputes about the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee make any further clarification of the matter at which its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neurological point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in round 3 to avoid a pat situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the constitution, or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he is candidates will win.
Mehren is allegedly willing to compromise that the candidate wins the higher number of votes from both chambers.
In turn, the Czech side is on the condition that the winner receives at least one two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two fronts have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-room concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Matrician side, which was best placed not to add to the electoral order, but to choose a valid statute.
Tomáš Paklík is also surprising, even though it turns out that the constitutional electoral order of all candidates is opposed to the most probably Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the time is chosen after the Statute."
"In order to avoid foolish alternatives, as at the last main meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who was first candidates and in his opinions he was especially confined to Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburg and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for football-EM today would certainly contribute to the satisfaction of the mothers."
"If the football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three adjectives and this at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl's more than that.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people from the trees and the swamps, but there are certain efforts to "react" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a new blockage at the main meeting is not excluded."
"But I hope that the healthy human mind finally prevails," said Rijkl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides will not be left.
Some negotiations should appear to play directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generality of football will be complete until the qualification game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rijkl should fly to Podgorica, could not even start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, and in this way we were looking for a replacement variant, but we were still looking for a part of the Executive Committee to be brought to the point of departure of the Barrage-Hinplay.
Finally, however, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial, which is supposed to be due on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the divided parties into an agreement within the country's largest sports association.
There is a lot at stake: State donations, the credibility of the Czech football and also the forthcoming ČSTV main meeting, which will show the Czech sport the new direction of the financial problems of Sazka.
Paklík is fighting for the president's position because he doesn't see any suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paklík, the leader of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary main meeting, could have been a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have joined the struggle for this top position.
"If there was a good defendant, then I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paklík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paklík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he will remember the President's function for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the end of the ordinary meeting.
In the position of the president, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too tight about football.
"I have spoken with some people who are in question personally."
"I can't believe some people told me they didn't want to identify with the Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is regarded behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegates' votes on major meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable that Pelta would have the president's position inside.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and in the Czech football it wouldn't go forward at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, is twice as bad for football," Paclík stressed.
He also argues that Pelta's name fell out of the Pelta case a while ago in connection with phone interviews to investigate corruption, but was punished.
"I don't know what prestige a victory from Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we be there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paklík, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes president", but he sees something left behind.
If Paclík wins the Thursday election, however, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported the Paclik in front of the main meeting in October, thought that he had ended up with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the union as manager."
"But I didn't put my nose in matters I didn't understand," said Paclík, who had taken care of it in September, that he was at the top behind the appeal of the Judicial Commission with Luděk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the president of the federation has grown.
And he relies on his ability to run private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the League.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to some cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain groups of interest who tend to influence disciplinary and disciplinary commissions, which is even in hostile situations," Paklík said, who does not make a cure from his antipathy, for example, against Spartan chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby political top politicians to see more money flowing from lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new president should devote himself to".
"If it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say very carefully and clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not look like a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the president of the FAČR must be "over-shared".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rijkl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But it doesn't make much sense in my opinion to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club apparently to a third party to return another half of the years," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR that would rule out a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised to strengthen himself in the event of his election, that the FAČR would receive new statutes which would rule out disputes about the electoral order in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident before Thursday's negotiations in Nymburg and believes that the election struggle will be achievable in the event of any success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to focus in his election on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last main meeting, and thus he liked to help him to defend his ideas on the leadership of the football and to present himself in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicate themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is led by someone, the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, who has also worked for many years with Sparta and the Executive Committee.
That is why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that Euphoria, who ruled in the days of Ivan Haszek, is responsible for today's election problems.
"Unfortunately, the main meeting was approved in June by the Statutes that were not as perfect as they had all been adopted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a president from September," Pelta said.
In particular, he used the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association as a means of locking for delegates.
"If I should become president, then I will take responsibility for it personally and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"That's a fundamental thing without which he can't be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to restrict himself to his competitors.
Earlier he had announced that he could present himself with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized because of his legal education and well knew that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Even Tomáš Paklík did not attack him for a long time, which again did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"But his attacks were suspended and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"That's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations that he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes of games to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to put an end to all affairs - from the Cause of Bohemian, to the remains of the corruption scandal last year."
"At the same time, I would go through negotiations with the private and government sector to ensure adequate funding for the whole football," said the six-forty-one-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football will not mean personal cleansing.
"I only had to be familiar with the work content of all the employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchy is understandablely nervous.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming main meeting, he believes that the delegates do not travel to Nymburg on Thursday.
"If it really should be the only controversial point, as you choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former vice-president, Jindřich Rajchl, was to be elected as the new president of the football association of the Czech Republic at the main meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly cause many people in the association to miss the prize.
Rijkl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case of improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and to continue the work that former President Ivan Haszek started.
"As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Started from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on national selection, professional football, and performance football for young people."
"That's why I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football will take place in every segment with miles of progress."
Many would not have liked this, because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard now themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered no longer running.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who don't necessarily throw knots between my legs and every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me I shouldn't give up because otherwise others would."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently it also motivates him to continue the work he has begun under Haszek.
"In two years we've managed a great deal of work and I don't want to just throw it away."
"Proceedings have been launched which will probably only come into force in a few years and I would only see that they stop someone," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Haszek.
"I believe in systematic action and this is something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"There are people behind him who would make the football so that he would be only there for the chosen."
I guess you can suggest something, but not that I'd be partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all good and not just the chosen," said Rajchl.
He also objected to the claim that he was only a Czech president.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best for ants."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a matrice part, whose winners then ascend to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three matrices clubs play in the League, which is especially a problem for young players in the Mehren," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paklík has joined the struggle for the President's function, Rajchl does not wish to underestimate his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice-President and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the Lotteries Act as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
While he says from Pelta, "he is previously disqualified from helping the Czech football to new confidence," he holds the second rival - Paclik for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, then he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has introduced and would obviously not change the personal occupation in the Commission."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things around for his own sake," says Rajchl about his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
By Julia Stanek
Plankbecks in Ufo-Optik, Punkpools in Budapest: Anyone who travels through Europe can experience his blue wonders - and after a tour of town or walking the tired legs in spa baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past half a year, one should not miss in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Back on the water, she looked high in artificially designed dolls, she swam across marble dots waiting for them on the shore of the basin, and stared over apribically restored youth-style swimming halls.
If she had a bathroom, she picked it up quickly in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored Meder's architectural history in this way - and now presents it in its recently published book "Badfreuden": folk swimming halls in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing enthusiast.
With sport she doesn't have much in the hat, says Meder - just in the water.
Unfortunately, swimmers need to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorgestank, while jogger can breathe the disturbing scent of fictitious forests or happy bird-wheat in the park.
"I asked myself one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the honey living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface double architecture
Placers in the spring pool and essential sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have worked hard, swimming baths can be a real eyebrows: "There is a water surface in the pools."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high waves, coloured tiles, springboards.
The kleinformatique film band "Badefreuden" spreads 190 pages of knowledge about the history of architecture and culture of historical wellness oasis - but especially makes it a pleasure to jump into the blue.
Notable examples were found by the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrated water in an Urine Karsthöl (Höhlenbad in Miscolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoors in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in view from the Zurich roof, you can look at the outdoor pool of a swimming pool in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can see the drive on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits guests in Langenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a hill just located in the Alps.
From three to open bowls it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals are said to be in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector of the smell of chlorine rose to the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it smells so strongly about heating oil that you hardly believe to be landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing helium water, which is almost black and its sleek glues one on the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathrooms: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bath Luhatschwitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bath, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, was now closed.
When the honey took a look through the windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw how unscrupulous between the tiles.
On the other hand, it is the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad that has been affected by the decline in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest.
Three construction phases already have this bathroom behind them; you can discover not only neo-romanic elements from the times of its creation in 1844, but also a maurice hall in Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of the pool Kenner Iris Meder - and not just because it comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already a power to melt so many different building blocks into such a great unity," Meder says.
At such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool is obvious only side-by-side.
Agri-Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you see raw material business
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the Group leader wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, it is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it not acceptable, according to a study, that banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize are speculating.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by the Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global stock exchanges are driven by the prices - and therefore the banks are responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche-Bank-Chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, raw materials laws were designed to protect traders from price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that the sugars have been disconnected from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "valued to put the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently reviewing the projections from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination will be completed and the results will be presented to the German Bank's board - as well as a recommendation on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank wants to report on its impact.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material trade, or even the complete reversal.
Ackermann bassed on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Wetting at rising food prices is particularly drastic, how careless banks are doing the general good today."
Ackermann is now the chief bank lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio in which money is used for betting at food prices," Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann about hungry people or the call of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight comes at first glance surprisingly, but it is clear that the Group Manager would like to present a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the head of management would not change to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
With a deviation from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible benefits he hardly needs to shave - so his successor would eventually have to do it.
Any second would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Just eleven percent therefore consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers facilities where food prices are set.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such business: each time the survey would cancel out all the installations in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would be known by such a bank, 49 percent would agree to consider canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The surrounded Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depth and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion from Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, standing empty and empty.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is heated by modern post-war architecture, by clear forms, glass halls, courageous cows and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzer's Pavilion was then given the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects known so that he built a pavilion at the next world show in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-storey house, he was finally internationally famous for his scenic side construction in Munich in 1973.
Its design as a temporary exhibition building was built, refurbished, and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th House" was called after the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden.
The building was suitable but not spatially and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long that contemporary art in Vienna was given a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the Pavilion, he now calls "21st House" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a success in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, who promoted art historian with a remarkable career, among others in the youth as an ice-skating runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, urged the reconstruction of politicians and thinkers, she obtained public funds and private sponsors and laid down the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same name, there should be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built.
Strong supervision, small state
Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only because he had significantly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and had won the competition, but because he had studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna and the Pavilion was an "unfortunately important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the Ur-design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost when he moved to Vienna and his re-use of generosity and ease.
In today's reconstruction there were much bigger problems: the building was "an energy shield", says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel bearings have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled tyres have been repaired.
Two undershots gave way to the new use, a dimly lit gap between the house and the street ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been removed in the old red-brown rust-protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly the way it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with a small state.
"Often a material had to be found which is good and cheap and also felt to the Memorial Office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstructions, the building remains flexible and easy.
It was difficult to have been with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet wants "to raise a proper consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden there is just the completely new planned "hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential houses.
And another accident may still happen: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporal Art Hall and, as you can hear, it already negotiates with the city for a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in million height
The train has developed a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related accidents and delays, the Deutsche Bahn issues a newspaper report of more than EUR 70 million this year.
The "Image" section reported previously on a group-in-group crisis plan, with a total investment of around EUR 300 million by 2015.
This is intended to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in the event of extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snowing on railway stations and railways to 16,000 people.
The aim is to release railways up to the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary flexibility within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube had also warned in this winter after a summit meeting with government and industry against delays and delays.
In the last winter, the train had major problems in passenger transport, as it was lacking, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has had to have ICE train axles checked significantly more frequently at the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Main Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the United States
After the Tumult about Chief Josef Ackermann comes a new inconvenience from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, industry giants are still taking up their past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in comparison to deal with disputes due to the pledging of five major social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks to have led the social banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have been lowering the risks.
Such paper lost its value during the financial crisis and the banks went into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not agree with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the agreement of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. corporate banks and is involved in appeals to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to replace the billions of serious damage caused.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator also called on other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, which the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs complained about.
These are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These household loans are based on.
When the U.S. real estate bubble placed in 2007, this became a number of financial companies to hang.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank defeated Lehman Brothers.
Even if the events have been back a few years, the banks are now facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous complaints in order to obtain reimbursement or to report irregularities.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest complaint.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have overrun the two state-owned US real estate financier Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage business in the amount of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint from the FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority shall require that Frankfurters be entitled to "substantial losses" without, however, calling an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as persistent and declared its intention to refuse.
Warren Buffet rises with 10 billion at IBM
Finanguru Buffet invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffet had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of companies is only being poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He has had to understand earlier that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighting blow in the financial world.
As a result, the IT Urgstein IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economic messenger CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is thus raised to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffet said that IBM had not even known anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, which even had provided for good profit in the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," said Buffet on the strategy.
For a time IBM has been focusing on the lucid IT services as well as the operation of computing centres.
The computer pioneer over 100 years old also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buff fat has been more than avoided by technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffet attacked, for example, a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a machinery farmer.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with smart investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha's Oracle".
According to the Buffet investment, the IBM share increased by a percentage first.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange and thus, along with Apple and Microsoft, is among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, as Buffett said, he doesn't want to go in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell", Turkish media in the German rule of law doubt.
A newspaper is talking about a "bloody ideology", which is now reliving.
The murder of eight Turkish-speaking and a Greek small businessmen in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is responded to in Turkey and within the German population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many Germans, therefore, there is a long-standing return: since the fire strikes in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany is still never a question.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals an extent whose dimension is not yet visible.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" titled the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection and is concerned that German authorities could also have been involved in the legal radical fungus.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted in a special way: she recalled on the weekend with a mahnwache in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians at a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish contract.
In happy colors the meeting was staged - as a story of success.
As an earpiece, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift to the Fiftyth" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken for this thoughtful connection.
"It begins to stink," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people were murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
It is extremely critical in German internet forums to discuss the conduct of the police and their subsequent success.
Why the German authorities have not had much more trouble looking for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some are at least rhetorically willing to resort to drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be slammed here, then nothing else will be left to the migrants but self-defense and arms".
"That'll probably be the best self-protection."
"Of the good of the enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network, the inner peace in Germany depends very heavily," writes "sell".
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained.
The photo of Solingen's branddrine is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that suspicion and distance can occur in the right.
The attacks, however, intensified the feeling of the weather on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press at that time the defeat of German politics was called upon after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the firefighting of Solingen, he sent a telegram to the Turkish presidents, but he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the mourner's party in Cologne - Kinkel was then counting in his speech how many charges were paid by the Turkish people.
Just as the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax duties.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how deep the suspicion of many Germans has been in the domestic rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of extensive clarification and re-evaluation of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is located, not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went into the financial crisis almost bankrupt and has since slipped from a crisis to the next.
Now it's up to a German.
That must have been how Axel Weber didn't think.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would enter an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucid career step.
Axel Weber was pleased in public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its renewed solidarity and made friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has created the tournament."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A retailer of the UBS in London had gone through all the bank's security systems and had swallowed around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland famous banker, had to go.
The President-in-Office of the Council of the UBS has since been struck - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
Weber was already known to be able to advise the bank of February 2012.
And he will take over the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economic professor and notary banker and would certainly have had a time of intervention.
With a blow he then assumes responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has just proved that he has earned the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
Because the UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently she was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other hand, it has been a scandal for years in the next.
Nothing, it seems, will save the Swiss bank once in a while.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the slid and solid but also outrun Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
The 2007 UBS managed more money than any other bank in the world with $1.6 billion.
And on the other hand, she was promoted as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The united banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger said: "My students at that time I always put the UBS as the pattern of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, how could I be so mistaken?"
He was wrong.
For the first time in 2007, there was evidence that there was a sudden fall in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief of Management Peter Wuffli returned surprisingly, which until then was considered a high-tech and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, they realized why he was gone.
The Bank's investment party had smeared with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To shoulder this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, which, over which some until recently the nose would have blown: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so cloudy that it did not even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to announce new losses of billions, the administrative board president Marcel Ospel, the second best-paying board in Switzerland in 2006, declined.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was facing its failed investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank purchased UBS for tens of billions of problem securities, the Swiss ownership company gave six billion francs for a forced-to-change loan over which it could become a co-owner of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet amount of the 2007 UBS was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We couldn't save the UBS once again," Bankenforscher Geiger says.
On the first disaster, the second one joined.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared itself willing to disclose the data of potential customers who might have withdrawn with the help of the bank's taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a refund of unfair profits from these businesses and a fine.
In order to make the UBS more or less known, the UBS was able to have helped with the tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had been her capital since in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of vanity.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive and the Chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking through fault speculation and in asset management through tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it again, then this invincible dealer story follows: a single dealer swallows 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: with risk management in investment banking, it obviously still does not work.
"With the case of Adobeoli, it has to be found that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and financial professor at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial manager of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not have the risk control."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had come long ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: not all too big a risk, for which security for money - it was also the hope that the world would break up beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks have become a symbol of irrefutable reliability such as Lindt and Springs for particularly noble chocolate.
The centre of the UBS in Zurich is still suited to the cliché of the diged Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Zurich Railway Station, which runs from the main railway station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's is found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Sprüngli confiserie.
For centuries the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS is accessed through a heavy door.
Inside the walls are marbled, before thick leather soles, next to the bank logo are a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes pushed - or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He does not want to read his name in the newspaper, he finally does, like all Swiss bankers, even business with the two major banks.
The UBS has become too large, he finds, especially in the investment banking, where the fishing axes had also expanded.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they've adapted to the seats of the sharks for a long time."
In fact, it was the angel-saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, protected it first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition of government of the small seven million countries decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros were approved by the politicians to save the large bank in front of the bank.
How could it happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland - and was still growing.
This helped to complement the two different preliminary banks of the UBS: a rich but sleeping bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but even stronger internationalisation.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks came at a cost of a lot of money, which enabled them to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise in the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Group Manager of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says Bankenforscher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach man who has worked from the banking teaching to the top."
But Ospel has finally relied on Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragically, maybe.
It is clear: Overwhelming came before the case.
Employees of the UBS clearly remember the leadership meetings, at which Wuffli Group Chief issued the same password again and again: Goldman Sachs took over from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She introduced the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks at that time.
Then the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been taken to make her happy.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she played with them all the way up.
However, corporate advisors who have been commissioned stress a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the fixed income banking language, there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in US mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS entered an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Hungered by growth, both the bank invested itself and a hedge fund that it had established in American subprime facilities.
She developed into a huge machine that packed securities on American mortgages and continued to hold risks, but also kept itself at risk.
Even when other banks were looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says Bankenexpert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to clean up seemed harder than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a locker seat and remain watchful to this day.
Whoever runs the Grand Bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has come down all the closely related business models.
Bankenresearcher Geiger already has an idea: close with investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink heavily, so much is now clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti of the world will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian Swiss was actually only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank suddenly separated itself from previous grübels.
Meanwhile, he has implemented: He is going to carry out the business of the UBS on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank informed him on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to go back to the investment bank in the middle of the 1990s.
He's in 3500 places.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
Why does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
In public, he just says he'll be looking for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe charged US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has taken courage from US investors for the weekend.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained powerless.
The threatened industrial production on the continent gave way to hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in Keim.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be implemented.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still in full swing last week, not as half empty - but now the problems were pushed back into the foreground, said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were included in the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values noted for the end of trade with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer hung between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax adopted a 1.2 percent reduction in 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and comes to the end of the boom.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistics Office.
The US investors were skeptical about this: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession as soon as possible, and there are further signs of weakness among the banks.
The investment-bearing Warren Buffet confirmed this caution only: It is not clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early to invest in European State bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a decade old principle across the hills and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the traditional group's share price and made it almost a percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper was almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buff fat has paid an average of $170 per piece according to its own data and is now 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's shares were significantly stronger by 2.6 percent than the market.
The house silverizes almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and extends $6.6 billion for it.
The Institute wants to boost its capital ratio with net profit from the business and thus meet more stringent regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing added and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock won 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and indicated the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.

719 added values, 2281 added after and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares of 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 in unchanged.
Smart cranes spread in cities
In many places, seeds are considered "problem birds": but from the cities, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be scattered, claimed experts.
They like one, they want to get rid of the other very quickly: crows have been part of the city's image for centuries, but in many municipalities people complain about the dust and noise of the animals.
In so far, the "problem birds" are not in sight.
Seed circles are no longer to be found out of the cities, said experts at the first crop symposia in the eastern Frisian forest.
There experts from all over the federal area offered possible solutions.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
The problems in cities also led to the land escape of the particularly protected seed circles: chemical use in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
The hunting, increasing construction and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Cows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 pairs of bridesmaids are located in West Soeste, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Löer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of cranes in the county of Negative Strikes had been provided.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the defeat with buttons as particularly brutal.
"The normal distribution, the engrossing, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out.
Swallow nests with water or fall trees, often with unwanted consequences, said also environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals vary, large colonies break up and spread elsewhere."
The exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools should be considered.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away."
Without the rest of the country, the problem in the cities was not solved, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said.
It can be thought that a combination of pets from sensitive residential areas and accommodation offers is possible to re-occupied them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "A pixel in the face we can finally bear the best of ourselves."
Jürgens had founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehppad, where the sign informs about the life of the high-tech sawmills.
The project is already being adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion about criticism at the sound of birds: "There is every amount of communication that has a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds not only use tools to get to a delicious bite, but they even present their own tool as a tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested four seedlings, how far the bird's intelligence is enough.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a storm with stones to reach a motten larvae.
Without much training, they recognized the target size and shape of a stone to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the pfifig cows then had to solve a more clumsy problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small ember with a mottenlarve.
With the garbage, the birds couldn't reach their bags.
However, the researchers had placed wires on them.
All four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then anchored the ember on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeds even reached this point.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosniaks and the Turks on a coup remained.
The favorites are Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland at the EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoffs.
Guided by two successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53.) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation perfect after 0:0 from the example.
In the play-off back game at the outside of Montenegro a 1:0 (0:0) arrived in the Czech Republic, after the play had already been a clear thing (2:0).
No longer burning Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland picked up a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved the next hit for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvězdan Misimovic with a transformed trading meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Red Map (54.).
Bosnia was already in the playoffs to the 2010 WM in South Africa to Portugal.
At the Paris Stadium in Lisbon Portugal started to measure.
Ronaldo hunted a free shot of about 30 meters for early leadership into the masks.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide range and reached 2:0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English Tablet Leader Manchester City placed a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball does not exceed the torline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Next, Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood at the centre.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Strafraum, Stark decided to take a swing and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which probably transformed the Misimovic.
But after the break, the Vice-European champion of 2004 made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended up in the 81st minute with the last doubts.
In this way, the European Master will follow the EM for the fifth time from 1976.
However, the team of Coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga Legionaries Michael Kadec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) had also been lucky and had to overcome a fear in the early stages.
Schlussmann Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest options when Duo Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot at the 40th minute of turning from the penal border just almost at the door of Chech.
After the break, the queerlatte had to save for the world class guard of the Czechs, again the FC Seoul storm had withdrawn (50.).
The door just before the end finally made it all clear.
Turkey thus missed the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come out of a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to place his seat as well as safely on the World Cup Third Bank in 2002, the Croatians are allowed to rejoice over their fourth participation in an EM final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had almost started a dream.
Selcuk Inan met only the postmen in the seventh minute with a remote shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to bring down the kidnapper in the door.
After the second of fear, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats were not allowed to burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, which took place in the 62nd minute for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic Square, the Federal Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intrecht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapatoni leads to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of the four-0 success in the background for a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) shines out for the guests.
Ireland pushed on time from the beginning, but had to wait until 23. Before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian team prevent the possible leadership.
But in the 32nd minute it was so far.
After an unfortunate protest by Clussmann Pavel Londonak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1:0 above the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were to be flown, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up appropriate staff," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The team is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers sit in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase its turnover to 20 billion euros by 2015.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, based on comprehensive enlightenment."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Fears begins with sentimental and generous. A story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of key people who go to heart.
Here is a tip how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in England's romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you as England's men and women are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he did not describe as "a work of anti-history" inapplicable.
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are few ambassadors, fast reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about what it was like. It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Fear" almost brings together the war experiences of 20 more or less inflexible men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, car drivers and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get mad or die.
Each of these lives sparkles up like the vowels in a church, some come to destroy others.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the vengeful war on the Westfront.
"Beauty and Fear" moves with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall to bee corps, a Christmas night among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsets flying are an unresolved problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war overwhelms the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells like cordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or catch the escape?
Who's coming at all?
No one understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Failure facts," says Englund, "were raised with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, alpine dreams and rumors."
"Beauty and Fear" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were taken mainly by memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be scary or exciting, but they are extremely vivid in the englends of the collection of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them are acting out of weakness and self-help.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replacement, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false radiator rubber, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in hamfat (and lastly served with a wrong bone of wood), tobacco, made from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes that were hired with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food additives allowed in the production of herbs, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to wildness and says about the war: "It feels that in spite of all this, what was more likely for men to sit in the chair than to sit in the chair, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and so to do, meant such a facade civilisation and there was no barbaric behind his own reinforced and beaten shirt chest."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you think of self-sacrifice, you want to think that this is happening in front of a public," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new forms of terrorism.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beastarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the suit that he kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseeable way and there are just as liberal behavior as heroism.
England speaks to the soldiers who actively tried to get involved with a prostitute with a sexual illness in order to escape from the service of the front.
"The great expression of this can be found in the trade with gonocoken-eiter, because soldiers bought and flocked to their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate grabbed him in the eye, which led to their being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry will be smooth and yet uncompromising and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he began the way of the war "in a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders bring them into battle.
The best books about the First World War were mostly faked like Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarkes "In the West nothing new" as extensive historical books.
The band of England joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it is as if he had taken this page away from us with his book and burned us with a string of wood.
After an early failure, a minutely planned overture
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
It was decided for the night of Monday on Tuesday, because at this time there are few people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All the others initially believed to participate in one exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was facing full challenges.
The events of the last few weeks, such as the use of pepperspray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the desernate and gives the houseowners a huge increase in public sympathy, could no longer be repeated.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zucotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view to Zucotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid release of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to enter the park came "in the last minute", someone who was familiar with the command said what a declaration called "execution" said.
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about the Zaccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zaccotti Park were the top officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clean up the park, but then they returned when hundreds of Protestants came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation from Tuesday, including use commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are normally used in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that during the day many people in the park enter and leave, almost like pendler, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park were staying," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready to leave at the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages from the speakers seemed to frighten many Protestants.
When the public officials entered their bright blue windjackets in the park, many protestors simply gathered their things together and left the place.
The police said that up to 1:45 p.m., no tents would be attacked to give the Protestants time to pack their property and property together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should be held in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson for the President of the Police, said this was their own safety.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop them from watching the police in the park, and they said that the officers' behaviour was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great cross-section of personal affairs of the Protestants, including suitcases, plastic lawns and towels with clothes, they followed their city cleaning staff who had withdrawn what had been left behind.
Some Protestants who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of Protestants was near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built-in barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp connect to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Disaster protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30.
The room was completed after 75 minutes of police statements.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the prisoners were arrested, as he said, because of "unfortunate occupation and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on the spot was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not operate", as Mr. Browne said.
In the event that they should access, a second group of officials was waiting on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortland Street, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how these police stations continued to extend the area around the Zaccotti Park.
At one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were seen driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern district.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the tire of a police bus.
In one place the amount threw a piece of wood.
In the end, an official and a protestor came to the hospital.
The Board of Directors will file complaints against the city for dismissals
The union, representing the hundreds of school-tourists who lost their jobs last month, plans to report the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals due to their inadequate influence on the schools that poor students teach are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the Board, District Council 37, in its efforts to withdraw the dismissals, is still open.
Sixty-seven school assistants, care coordinators and other staff members who were among the worst paid employees in the city and had lost their work in a chess course on 7 October, described the trade union leaders as political rache that had refused access to a health fund held by the working groups last year to close the budget gap.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said last month that dismissals were part of the budget that had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that there was nothing more specific in the budget than that school aid workers would be fired.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to announce the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will be filed by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as accused and eight dismissed workers are brought to trial, all of which are colourful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the City's Ministry of Justice, said that the city did not present the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of dismissals at the schools in the city's poor districts to support a complaint for unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more aid since they have been chronically underfunded.
It indicates that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and only a few dismissals in the upper east side or TriBeCa schools, 17 students in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 were discharged in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students were in poverty, the complaint said: "This is not a neighborhood of well-known parents who can organize donations to collect budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th District was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra funding for each Armenian school registration.
The board also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were led by language into a memo that approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (English: translate) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six assistance coordinators were released, not translated," says the complainant.
Mission finished, Congress ready to learn about Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington had already agreed on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American integration.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations decides a resolution that supports the President John Kerry (Massachousetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), who praised Libya for its successful rebellion and the US troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support for its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House dispute the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or distort the role of the US military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad border group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the House endorsed a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission is engaged in a kind of legislative fire - with a congress that had enough to criticise Obama's actions within the mission, but not angry enough to finally take his ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congrats the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their own liberation" and "comforts the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Committee on Foreign Relations or will they separate the legislators as has been done by the law of June?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Committee's top Republican.
Lugars Speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every parliamentary period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlate (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or to another area to be put to the vote at the time of the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlate's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been presented to this Congress and include a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to Congress and the Senate - others only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - in particular the beginners of the Republicans who want to pool their lives - the opportunity to "write" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress may submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limitation on two presidential terms.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage among homosexuals is just as a change that prevents the burning of flags is an ever-increasing template.
In addition, some legislators want to enable the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As enthusiastic as the Members suggest, they are moving as quickly as they have in recent years.
At the 111st Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. at the 110th Congress 66.
Compared with those of the early 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, the figures provided by the Senate library are missing.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Founded, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after a gunman had shot her at her during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She was alone on the Broadway track "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she called for words and needed help on her way.
The transmission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the ball that splits its skull drilled through the left side of its brain and pierced its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to Congress to give her voice to the debt brake triumphantly.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, when six people were killed and 13 were injured, Giifford laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The Special is following Giifford's recovery since the assassination of January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a coldly shaven head and a long shell over the head.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giiffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nickel with the head.
A cake with a lipstick.
And then her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see the congressional delegates singing together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanda Have Fun" and to Tom Pettys "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giiffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he had read to Giiffords on 12 March an article in a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people killed during the assassination.
Jared Lee Loughner, a conscientious guardian, is in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people have died," said Gifford Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you will endure and you will recover and you will return stronger than ever.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots, and sailors gathered around him.
The amount of black smoking stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation in spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed by the chief of staff and then president, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as children of orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it really wasn't.
The striking contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes surprising, American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, officials say.
The public is becoming more and more concerned with how they make people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, the troops in Iraq ordered and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support him is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also found that the anger that the returning troops fought in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, discussions on compassion in silence and private relations between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battle with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a feeling of awe, for they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether "a angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return took over an elevated state post in Washington.
During his search for work, he said he felt that some of the interrogators were subtle in asking whether he was able to stand immediately after his return from the fight to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly due to the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
A country that has little experience with the military and only a few benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is rarely taken out as a praise.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of the politicians and the public is mainly focused on the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military is facing increasing pressure to take a hard time in rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are accused of non-violence in cases of rape before the military court.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Topless Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who brought a 12-pack beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went off," Lyman said.
But the Texanerina took her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd heard my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came after her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which they will decide whether they have brought an action against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been committed against widespread violence within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint, the complaint included at the beginning of 17 plaintiffs, who rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claimed that they had been raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to ascertain, condemn or provide appropriate prosecution after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in position to eradicate the culture's vengeance? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 other survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of putting all the plaintiffs' eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many other complaints to keep the pressure up.
The Defence Team for the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject the complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice which appear in Newsweek provide in detail the defence strategy, first of all, that the military cannot be accused by current or previous soldiers of injuries to which it has come in the military.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for any violation of soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name of: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with domestic women in the war zones.
The result: 150 soldiers died between these two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's about time the military is being upgraded, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle; three others are in charge of her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four most important military academys for the purpose of promoting an atmosphere that is hostile to women.
Regardless of this, Vietnam Veterans of America is raising a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", which received rape victims in order to get them out of service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of the war veterans), in which she called for discriminatory practices in her dealings with performance claims for persons who indicated that she had been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offered a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for the Prevention and Notification of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual abuses were shown.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes every year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the military were brought before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the arbitrary abuse of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker that came from a cut on her arm was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had had before the assault with her friend.
Six persons said in character on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally released.
"I remember well the day the sentence was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the tears would be used. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to search for a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and explained it to the staff.
In January 2010, she was unfairly dismissed, so she did not receive any support.
Whether the complaint submitted by Lyman and the other plaintiffs has been preceded is purely speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he observes: "I think they should come forward."
What lies between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I am, in time, a critic of the Fares doctrine.
The military goes back a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same fear that brings a liability with them.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff of the plaintiffs, will begin with its hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who was standing at an ammo in Norway in July when 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to login to Facebook.
"We found it not hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report by the British Idea Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hidden personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extreme right-wing groups across Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, Add's users are invited to a survey where they were asked about their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office even once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online advocates of right-wing groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising turnaround, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are smarter, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas manufacturers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on average three content per day, Facebook's "Datasupernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this site in the title in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you usually do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to question people of the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never give them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook it all goes away - they go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full Facebook experience tend significantly more to drink problems than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as resident advisors, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify dangerous children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly attacks the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics on the status of relationship and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in the 2010 elections and a national happiness index (which was used in the first line of information on which only Facebook has access - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large database available for other research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they want it now or not. In order to be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to produce your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she is concerned, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and every amount of social life still takes place offline."
"Calt and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who was standing in two ammo loops where 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Norwegian chaplain," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I raise objections to the Court as you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hassidicology and that is why multiculturalism is supported."
"I recognize the laws, but I'm not guilty."
Richter Torkiel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, since he "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who gave a pre-written speech, the permission to turn to his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Breivik Police keep it under investigation for 12 further weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will be accurately checking all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eye; others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and the castle.
Everyone took part in the goal of getting everything out of the way.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," told a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me, it goes on a bit after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre note, he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had any complications.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 appeared to be the work of an individual extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does it automatically relieve the anxiety and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lectures of the interview with the dead Steve Job, which was shown this week in a theater
After Steve's death on October 5, some compare him to Henry Ford and highlight technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans find in the most recent job interview discovered in recent years, which was pushed out this week before special film shows on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself named hippie, but he was also an acrobic organizer who worked hard on diagrams - a man who believed that many managers were suffering from "a disease of the mind", "that a really great idea made up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fachidiotes" about the break-up of the computer, and he spent more than an hour with jobs where they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, it was 10 years since jobs were pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he says the copies of the interview were missing in the delivery.
It was only after Job's death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the Director's garage.
This easy-to-read film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is aware that he rejects detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflections in which the job clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism comes to an end when it seems impatient to respond to Cringely's questions and entices him to go faster on issues or side-effects of greater importance.
Prior to the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview appears somehow uninhabitable when jobs evaluate what other companies think is right or wrong and represents their own vision for the future of the computer.
It is a thing to read posthumous awards of career jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the desirable dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things might be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he took off and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to run a company:
" Throughout the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting with Apple.
Surprised at how costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were just supposed to be applied and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was altered:
Jobs is told by the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the phone company and engage in phone conversations.
Much has been written about the device, but when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorisation, it is exciting.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a payable phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT&T network to another while passing as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you rolled into the phone, it came out a minute later on in the phone next door," says Jobes kickin'.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be any Apple without it.
Jobs further tells of a glorious string, the Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger so well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomats, both had to laugh out before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, she got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen when I was old and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the research labs of the company in Palo Alto where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tubes and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up as a teenager at HP and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Many times in the interview jobs talk about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he built some platinum, he was asked by a customer to build the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the construction and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember passing arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15.
About large companies that are following:
Long before he let Apple live again, jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants lived with their visions in Stolpern and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better copyer or printer, well?"
They have the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it is] people who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius that has led to this monopolization is driven by people who have no concept of good products and bad products - handicraft art is necessary.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You've won the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is every amount of art between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his fineties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to notice 5,000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Finally, it runs out on the taste, it runs out on the fact that you try to get the best evidence that people have created, put together and then try to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists shout.
We are always shy about stealing great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of health laws, as the case is passed
On the day that the Supreme Court gathers doors behind closed doors to discuss the political issue of whether to hear an appeal against President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the Chancellor to represent the case before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the requests for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint raised by 26 states against the extensive reform of health, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law that became the slogan of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stifle the presidential struggle in 2012, which will be in full swing at the time when the ruling will be announced.
The lawyer standing before the court who will claim that the law is to be cut, is likely to be Paul Clement, once a state attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case at a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Group leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting Federalist Society events for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are freed from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may participate in benefit events of law close to and other organizations, with the judge not being a speaker, a respecter or according to the program no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the associated offices, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest, is sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the opposite of the Code is punishing the complaints of some judges, the court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a citizen's right movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with floating procedures in the court."
Their actions and their support for a donation for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would be too easily mixed up with groups led by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claimed that it was Judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney-general under Obama's government when the first legal proceedings were brought before the court.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from hearing the case because of pre-inception, as she was too committed to defending the law to be uninitiated.
Kagan doesn't make any arrangements to do this.
Boeing attracts record order of 18 billion dollars to land
Air carrier Emirates orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It's really rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is total at a record amount of 18 billion dollars.
Also unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, Chicago's company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need $2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its greatest order of all times for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer mission came from the air carrier Emirates from Dubai.
In addition, in 2011 Boeing announced it at Dubai Airline, an option to buy 20 other aircraft that would increase the total list price to 26 billion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called dreamliner, which greatly improved the gas consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"That's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stockman of Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the aircraft. Instead, there is an increase in oil prices, which usually damages airlines, as this is one of their biggest costs, not so bad as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural assurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the airbus competitors SAS in check that attacks the dominant position with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the air show comes four months after the airbus announced, the introduction of the largest A350 would be postponed, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was shifted to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher payload and scope.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister seems to be losing her choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer against Fausto Vallejo supported by the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for government posts in the western state from the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially on the hard day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they occupied polls, built roadblocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just barely hit Claderon who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative Party Action National PAN of her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current Governor-in-Office, came to position three, a severe defeat for the divided and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia's capital, lies in connection with drug dealers and forces the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was ruled for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still taking place.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates were expelled from the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reprehensible the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us courage next year."
ADB forces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of ADB based in Manila, said that the two world's fastest growing economic nations must do "all in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that they were looking at the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support from European leadership and European resources through Asia would help prevent the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We all sit on the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
In recent months, the European Monetary Union has been facing a serious debt crisis.
In the past few days, Italy's interest rates have risen dangerously and the Prime Minister has retreated from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe was afraid that the global economy could collapse into recession and led to calls for leading emerging countries to join together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag said that any support from Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU Savings Fund’s Bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - provide greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, since its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face great challenges and we need to get a high level of growth."
"It is no option, it is an order, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no incentive to help rich Europeans when they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India to help Europe, of which more than 800 million dollars or even less live on the day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks go to rent with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB forecast with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/now threatens "the risk of graduation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable wave markets had to create "crisenplane" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Emergency warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta urged the Congress on Monday to warn that automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war camps in Afghanistan and the civilian flows.
The Pentagon is already considering reductions of $450 billion over the next decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of $600 billion or more will be necessary if the Congress is unable to reach a conclusion in the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be overwhelming for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement leading to a so-called seizure would result in 23% general cuts as well as a stop of numerous new projects.
"So a high reduction, carried out in such an unobservable manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unimplementable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also have been forced to separate ourselves from most of our civilian personnel voluntarily and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians to reach the goal with certainty of cross-border probability."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who keep our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were finally met with the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the major intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the attitudes that support the war."
"The staff's salaries would be reduced, which would result in late payments to war-sales dealers and interfered with both legal and political support."
The two senators responded to panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential influence of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the seizure of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are very opposed to this draconic action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it's certainly not something that we should be forced to do."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Pannetta's letter and the senators' new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to remove the Pentagon from the cuts will remain pending.
Panetta has increasingly unmistakably expressed the possible cuts, although he had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture that could appear - a military with shell but no kernel.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air-gun failure without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paperman, an army of cashiers, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a power of war that lacks moral and alarm and that is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"She lets you get really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details of how reductions create "significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, severe restrictions on our global employability and accessibility, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects of the strike could fall to the victim, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter, the Army and Marine need to replace the humvee.
If the further development and testing of the F35 were to be stopped, this would save up to 80 billion dollars in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to be completed so that possible dangers can be avoided by China and other opponents.
How to Defend a Lie
A look at the current battle lines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The candidate for the presidency of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is engaged in the charge of becoming the Lord of the sexual harassment of several women.
The management of Penn State is accused of meineid because it was reported that a retired football coach boy had been sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressional and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a fool when he brought about lies, which were quickly rejected by unsurpassed evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the failure to finance the campaign, which is linked to the smuggling of an external affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton fired when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with him.
Stories about mushrooms in school and college exams are widely distributed.
There were occasions when teachers provided their students with the test answers so that they could be there in their performance reviews themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and molds are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Like studies, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
But many of these lies are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that foreigners lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or "to discover lies" is one that is important to everyone, both for personal and professional reasons.
Because of a social game such as Scarade, in which it is the goal to call "Have You!", the detachment of a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades at respected universities that have carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths were invented over the lie.
Lies look into one's eyes.
They don't always grow, grow, grow and grow.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these lies are difficult to detect and untangle.
A trained liar can come across the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, the question and timing.
I have spent several years researching the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of evaporation. And it is clear that the evaporation of a fraud is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding justice in our complex world, especially if the appointment or demand of persons or negotiations or administration is part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, raising their interest and controlling their own emotions. And they feel intuitive how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, the extroverted people often lie more than the introverted people that men often "self-oriented" lie than women whose lies more "orientate themselves" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was expelled as an evildoer, others felt less guilty of having angels.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing this person's normal behavior.
This is called "Baslining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laugh, the quality of the voice of her person.
You should know better when someone usually gets tripped with the foot, so they don't blame him for injustice when he gets tripped with the foot during a meeting.
Then watch out for attacks of opulent verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these attachments as alarm bells, which scream, not as evidence of detachment.
People who cheat may hesitate when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet are pointing towards the door or they turn towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "restoration after the setting," this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Questions often falsely indicate that an attitude conversation is over only in order to keep an eye on the attitude after this relaxation.
Also watch out for the language of your tried person.
Scott Peterson's ex-con is famous when he used the past form, when he claimed his dead wife was still alive and a national search triggered her.
Disgusting people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a stupid question at all.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a clumsy question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to the best of knowledge and conscience."
This will make the answer more understandable than the case, so that the alarm bells often scream.
There is no magic to banish lies, but you can learn skills by which to banish them.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can become a victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised by delayed US approval
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, whereby the trade unions were upset and at the same time calmed down the environmental protection system, it is the pipeline that is trying to plan the project again so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills will be transferred to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Purbax of TransCanada said that the company was still reliable, which was finally approved by the pipeline, even though it had a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be issued until the new possible course was examined to prevent the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala acquis, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may deliver a decision by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Foreign Ministry and said that it would support it.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline had to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislator Nebraskas, who opposes the plan, weighs down the laws to force a return from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and water.
The current study on the environmental impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had only a small impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy said that the head auditor of the Ministry had requested a separate probe of the review process, which focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist appointed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is in contact with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle complained that she allegedly forced a child out of fear to break
A New Yorker family claims that the disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have suffered a heart attack that would have put her little daughter so afraid that she would have given up in fear.
The tyranny of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was last November 10, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a kindergarten girl, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Rosana Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm into the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Rosana Monk said she stopped at the door and laid her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to pick her up again," she said.
LaBelle reminded the pregnant woman of her anger.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Rosanad Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and began to chirp - she used the F-word and the A-word and was very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you've done with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle rushed to the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm and had to stay back from her accompanying and be dragged to a waiting car," said Rosana Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelles' lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a non-specific compensation, but the family lawyer Sam Davis said that he does not account for a fee and plans for the family, the money they get, the child cancer aid will be donated.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when a child gardener is placed on the day that bears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate resistance brakes the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who called himself the initiator of the change and had great hopes about economic growth, is at the government. However, due to the climate constraints, growth cannot be the word, but instead the main economic indicators have worsened.
The low temperatures in February not only resulted in losses of millions in agriculture, but also raised close limits to the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% in the first quarter of the year. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16%, which has a slowdown in other sectors.
According to a report by the Council of Mexicoo para el Development Rural Sustainable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of frost, 582,000 hectares of agriculturally used land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the rest 21.07 percent were mainly affected by vegetable, maize and peanut cultivation.
The decline in economic activity until November has allowed unemployment to rise continuously in the Mexican state. In the first quarter of the year, the Instituto Nacional de Estadostica y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55,053 people in Sinaloa had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 per cent of the working population. In the second quarter, unemployment rates rose to 5.28 per cent and from July to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 people over the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that public institutions' policies declare the growing unemployment indirectly.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the cuts in the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy to let these work for themselves to invest or use for something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due to the problems of entry and because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which leads to rising unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when considering the high proportion of black labour. This includes 60.38% of the people employed in the country who work without paying into the social insurance boxes.
The low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, are due to unemployment and black labour, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretariat of Labour y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was up to September 5352 pesos; this is much less than the overall average of 7375 pesos.
ADI decrease
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the highest decrease in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to the Secretariat de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was between January and June 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to a total of 87.74 percent compared to the $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Secretariat of Economic Development (Government Authority for Economic Development) lists a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, in July the Government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities. The country congress approved an amount of 200 600,000 pesos, but no positive effects on any of the economic sectors in the country could be found by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the company, the first year of government, Mario López Valdé's inability to government was revealed.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really nice this year. It has to be worked hard to get the land lost this year and we have to work hard twice as hard in 2012. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well-agreed government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as frost at the beginning of the year made economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not moving enough to generate an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of employers of the Mexican Republic, explained in Sinaloa that the state had to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a future perspective that is linked to the efforts of the government in better railways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current government had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg Marihuana
Five years of imprisonment and 100 daily detentions were sentenced to one of the inhabitants of Navolato because of the possession of eight Kilo Marihuana.
The public prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of Marihuana for trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican soldiers in monitoring the Cipriano Valdez street against watchpost No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white delivery car in which he kept a black toe in a box in the car and in the driver's seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the goods seized were handed over to the District Judge and the penalty is still in the courthouse.
Debts for construction
The social buildings provided for by Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the City Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already progressed, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds it deserves that exceed the three programmes of 11 million pesos.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Up to now only the federation and the community had contributed to the construction work, so it was expected that the construction would be delayed.
"12 million must tax them, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a share already in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already begun the construction work, and they have already made far progress, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations, so at the beginning of its time the community had to borrow a loan of 7 million.
"This has already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continue and this year we had to buy the funds that the state had not invested to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the State authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance had been asked to speed up administrative work and pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Nearly 12 million must be taxed, and even though the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals in recent years is one of the most important changes in the world.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) showed the constitutional appeals brought by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Class and the power to bring forward the switchover of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, were of the view that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his responsibilities when he issued the Bill with details on the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to enable the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the draft complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Decree of Law against the Constitution, since the Commission Federal de Telecommunications (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the radio and television regulations, so the Decree of Law would oppose the principles of hierarchy and the provisions of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer appealed to the Legislative Decree and introduced all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies, without taking part in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the President-in-Office said that he did not agree with the project's arguments and that the country's government was not allowed to regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration in general.
"I also do not believe that if this were to be done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because this leads to state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years around the world, and it makes better use of the radio spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the conversion meant that it was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which not only had technical views, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "required the whole system to act, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they contained a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital change, although they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government would intervene in Congress's jurisdiction by issuing the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be respected," she said.
The possibility of counting the voting lists in Michoacán is taken into consideration.
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second seats in the election of the Governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of counting the voting lists is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Program de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governors' elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of 6074 not yet counted.
In this regard, the President of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llenderal Zaragoza, recalled that, just last November, the polling station had adopted a number of regulations to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in outstanding matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted neither his political constitution nor his election law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they did not come into force at this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided publication in the public display within the time limits for this to be set with the argument or objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislation and judged the State Representative's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since he did not have the right to "conclusion or vote against it".
Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of counting the votes individually, that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Council General del IEM, the possibility of the local electoral authority being able to count the voting list in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may not be counted in part. The results in the minutes do not agree; the vote count and calculation protocol is not in force or is not owned by the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
In addition, the total number of fully completed ballots may be counted if there is a difference between the moderate winner and the second winner, which is equal to or less than one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request from the Party or the Coalition Chairman, who is the second of those candidates.
The vote count may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the proper calculation, it is established that the difference between the moderate winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one per cent, subject to an explicit request by a representative of the party whose candidate has become the second. In this case, the electoral packages which were subject to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and the second seats is almost 0.16 per cent, although the votes of 129 of the total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés took place this Sunday at Saltillo, his place of birth. On Monday the show and a death show took place.
According to family members, the Colonel's last will was to scatter his ashes across the Zapalinamé mountain.
After one honour, the Bacio Cortés family returned, together with the others who were killed in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force, to the capital of Coahuila. The commander took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon noon, the ash of the Lieutenant General landed on the mourner hall at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo. This corpse was held by his former students from the technical Abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparations for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always told his family and friends that," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't catch it because they thought it would even rush him on a truck. Still, he always wanted to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already wanted to welcome the whole family, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he was driving to Zapopán to graduate from his family. So he knows that his uncle died when he did what he felt best: flying an airplane.
A Last Delimitation
The Mexican Air Force Commander Felipe Bacio Cortés was elected under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López with all due respect. His honor was granted to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leaders and students of the Saltillo technological educational institution, where he studied in 1985 and was also an excellent student in both study and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter that he was flying from, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were also disbanded.
At 6:05 p.m., Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, met to be handed over on the front seat of the barracks by the property company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were expecting him.
The abandoned bodies were found on a piece of land at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, military personnel presented the media to eleven persons who had been arrested in the same area in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found shot in different parts of the body and killed in an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the point 1.5 km from Caderyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several precedents saw that the door of the house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood up across the barrier.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another who was clothed with a white top.
Almost a meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received on-site, the three persons must have been killed elsewhere as no pattern holes were found.
On the wall of the farmhouse there are inscriptions to be read that write an organised criminal band to another, and several entries were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadreyta
The Secretariat de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for State Defence) introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal movement that was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who were linked to kidnappings, murder, haloneo (men's hunt) and secret procedures.
According to the information made publicly available, eight persons were arrested and a prisoner was released on 11 November.
Three properties and a phone were secured. The detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On 12 November at 0600 hours, military officers found a PCW with no number signs on their watch in Rancho Viejo village in Cadereyta.
During the carriage inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, at 2:00 p.m. on 13 November, one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to seize the escape at the sight of the military.
You will be apprised of private contributions in the locations General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government, which is due to provide the guidelines for the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government, which is due to provide the guidelines for the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A communication from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm government training.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will join his office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on government education.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to complete these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well hidden," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, needs to adopt a tough savings package, which Europolitics have been required to regain their confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti was still increased by the fluctuating market situation, due to the pressure on Italian government bonds for 10 years with 7 percent interest, which corresponds to the state that Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Industrial Association of Confiindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government according to all the forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The success chances of Montis were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to retreat on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of the government of technocrats, which forms Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the probably unaccompanied savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the postponement of reforms could again have a devastating impact on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks practises with his notice, a defeat Montis is a disaster, as well as pressure.
Monti began his discussions on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations and youth and women's organisations.
The session is scheduled to end at evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, has set in motion an extremely rapid government change.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would retreat, because of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs for Italian state bonds have again reached critical limits.
An Italian rescue with a public debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government had to hold until the next elections, which are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties are concerned that this should only be made up of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the process of printing the financial markets.
Political sources suggest that mutual suspicion and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more games than the ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten out of 50 international games are on the back.
On the side Costa Ricas has only one of the 22 summoned 50 games behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 p.m. in the San José National Stadium, will be compared between players from both countries.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back at a considerable number of Class A selections, the three-color team has only the defence player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number reached him on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential Clubs of the British Premier League have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie comes with complicated exclusion games at Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
On the other hand, Tico footballers have few international meetings in the context of the Concacacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last record: The Torwart Iker Casillas, which reached the same level as the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Netherlands 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team that reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Follow him Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side storm Junior Díaz with 48 games and the Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games appear in the Spanish team Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the sides of the national team come to less than 30 Roy Miller games with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had their debut yet.
The historic torhüter of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most doors, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet referred Costa Rica to its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that they had a dream when they were playing in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview last week of Brazil.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and on Sunday 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will be at the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation that is complete in La Nacion's online edition.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means to your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been on vacation in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are completely out, and you're going to experience the most intense days before the concert.
What's your favorite fans saying?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it makes us sad to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've spent in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have a desire to play there.
We love this country, we enjoy surfing and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and her waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent thing to surf. This way, about people who love surfing, we have learned from it.
With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the Costa Rica event?
Since we've never played there, we don't have limits either.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play some songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You'll never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine albums and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision that we are going to play each is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have not played anymore into the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think so for the public.
With this tour, you celebrate your 20-year story.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I think that none of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band, and that for over 20 years, it seems like a dream.
We also continue to focus on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We love and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have been actively involved in the birth of the baby?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
Over and over, a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are glad to be still friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this rising Seattle sounds.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has been together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is a lot more time than many bands can last.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being still alive and we also care about each other.
We are all close friends, so we have opened up musical ways that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't do better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall off this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you think people have come because of the music, you remember that you have to be careful about the music and what it has called into life without forgetting to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great at first.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until Andy's death.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible man Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we missed him.
The Las Robertas national band is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose to open up?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band felt best for us. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's text when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he likes.
Who were you influenced by as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first to touch me are Geezer Butler, John Developmentle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the ground alive even though it was no longer a fashion show?
I think we all don't feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that might seem something easy to play. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive on themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - this affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs make it clear to me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was transferred to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the loss of muscle in his legs, his house doctor informed him.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who spent 25 years in prison for violations of human rights during his period of government (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tooth cancer, which is operated four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would study the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Severades Neoplásicas.
Aguinaga commented that he thought that Fujimori could be tried for humanitarian reasons. Still, he did not want this because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on tooth cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. Other diseases such as severe erosion of gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal cavity, kidney stones, blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs were reported by the doctor.
Fujimori has been in the National Police Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official presentation by the Uruguayan President José Mujica, consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts her visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss the political issues of the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan President, this will be the highlight of his well-established schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The discussion of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the president of the South American country announced on his website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support regarding the case with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes placed the South American country on a list of tax havens.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that continue to act as tax havens from the international community.
Since November Mexico has chaired the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful emerging and industrial countries. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double-setting with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to remove from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The tailor-made installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which comes this month to the loading docks of the world, has been cut off from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which it can be played without a special glass three-dimensionally.
"Mario is the figure that says how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing on Nintendo in Spain when presenting the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D land" was "the first video game of Nintendo that was developed from the beginning for this console" because until now success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been articles that already exist.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "exquisite" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games in one piece: The first part is "light", to capture the less sent users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels that are becoming more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or a one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This Super Marios trip into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo swings the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the latest editions: The narrow-handed installer must overcome platforms with danger to free Princess Peach.
However, the player is at odds with news about the movements, the environment, the costumes and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom provides for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would issue the former governor Alfonso Portillo to take responsibility for the 70 million US dollars in the United States for the money laundering.
This is the end of the process of requesting the US to deliver Portillo so that it can be brought before the court.
In a press conference confirmed by Colom, his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the issue.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered with court decisions and held all the submissions he had been notified of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Coloms procedure is a government act, which takes place if all the judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be delivered when his legal situation in Guatemala has been clarified and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his term of government.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion
The organization was called into action to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social aid organisation have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the jobs created for this social group amount to over one hundred.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a balance sheet was drawn at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the city district of Trinidad Vella with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the severe celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous managers from institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for these 25 years participated.
The participation of political representatives of different directions to the times of election proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green city council Richard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was brought into life in very difficult times and that the present times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generality, Trinijove is an example of fighting difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
The occupied house in which the giant parties were organized has been cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve houseowners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything points to the fact that the alpine dreams of the neighbors of House No. 51 have ended on Balmes Street.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied last afternoon, where they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The room was held on a court order without police intervention.
After the room, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be checked," the house manager confirmed.
The houseowners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of them lived - included the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. They also had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially doses with alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and the tenants were driven to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business would have dropped by 80% since the start of the household.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the owners of the house were making them more unfairly competitive because they sold the drinks to three euros while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure space was shown by the neighbors for restlessness, while according to their statement, the noise was not driven by the visitors of the disco, but by the owners of the house, and especially by the guests of the parties organized there, and who, according to the statements of the offended neighbors in the last few weeks, became more and more prolonged.
The head of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that she joined the owner of the building, not having to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from her neighbors in the last few weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week to clean up the building without delay and to get the problems of civil life and the fall of the city district into grip.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before summer, but that in the last few months the houseowners had been forced into all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some, it had even been stolen.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the social actions in the building."
Yesterday another building was removed from the Catalan police in the Nou Barris district.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached the Montreal No. 35 street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were arrested without delay.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, apart from the arguments about the honours.
The city's 16-door call opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to the new.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the currently disappeared Corporation Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its article on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again to the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is among the few that do not spread in the north-south direction but up (mountain) and down (sea).
The Collserolas classification as a nature park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park was no longer serving but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibar.
So far it was when the city in September had a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
Without a doubt, a door points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's got to put a door on the ground.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The invitation is not only from an organizational point of view, but also from a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent topic that two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can take back.
And exactly this fact offers the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is suitable.
For Roldán "is necessary", after an attack on the coast about the "front on the mountain", in so far as the speech of Ildefons Cerda, which was not delivered about the green apples, has not been delivered.
"You should assume from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore von Collserola" gives a "lexical case" in itself: one cannot imagine it "as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas to be dealt with."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge", the "some dangers" in itself.
The danger is due to the "uncertainty that the design of a public space today brings with it" following the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swinging song" in the area of the Forum.
The first fear is the own restriction on what can be built.
"To limit something always means to determine the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [taking on the plan of General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, which is closer to the question, is thought to simplify the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park which is not towards Barcelona", and for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronate de Collserola that should not "slowly listen," although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment".
He also notes that the closeness of the mountain to the city of the guide letter is which enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his doubts as to whether this technical profile should guide "We architects should be only a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the terms of the invitation to tender there is no global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions," he says, "on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no long-term perspective that considers the area as a whole."
This has at least led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would coincide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his view, the city should absolutely guarantee that the stripe is so equipped throughout the Ronda de Dalt that it creates a smooth transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red's authorised officer freed the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process that is being conducted against him due to arbitrary repression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released, after the Casino's High Representative Red has handed him over to the Second District Criminal Court, which is leading the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for repression.
After the attack on the Royale Casino, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Red Casino, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to watch, forcing him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration can approve the secret operation of the house.
According to the fine, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the Pakistani mayor, who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the city of Antiguo, with the official of the Ministry of Publico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales.
In that place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest order, after the Ministerio Público had dismissed the crimes for defamation and organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison because he had allegedly robbed the owners of the Casino Red with half a million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle safety line, since he was threatened with murder.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an instigator of the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was given a prison regulation by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who found that after almost two months of ongoing investigations, sufficient evidence was presented to make Jonas guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the court in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the representatives of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to release the sentence, which is why he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs, García Gómez, asked whether he had repaired the damage and who had apologized to the owner of the courthouse.
According to Case 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. Also, no objection can be made to the process, and no compensation is required.
After hearing the Ombudsman of the House at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The Justice Secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be put to the record.
He also informed him of the legal order for the immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and seven others died.
The Secretariat of Communications y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the Government Secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other persons died point to the fact that the helicopter was hit directly against the ground with its entire unscrupulous structure without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of communication and transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 meters height, while the helicopter lost its hull seems to have had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 seats, which is why he met all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no part of the helicopters were found during the studies in the area where the machine was put down.
"In the search, no parts of the aircraft were found at other locations, the survey covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 seats, so he met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area shows a drop of 7 to 30 degrees.
It is now a priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but these can take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and auxiliary services in Mexico) assured that the helicopter from the State Major Presidential flew at a speed of travel and the aircraft fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of arrival."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visualisation speed:
In accordance with the flight schedules, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the crew had to have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM listed suitable weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexican State, some deep-stressed clouds appeared.
Selected airsizes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Lap point:
The landing coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps it did not result in a loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight size before the landing.
Dispersal of the rest of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information so far indicates that the helicopter was directly and side-by-side.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was landed on the ground with its unscrupulous structure.
No indication of fire or explosion:
The rest of the aircraft offers at the crash site neither on fire nor on explosion.
The last results of the investigation were based on several ground contact.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The site is decommissioned and shows an impact of between seven and thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information indicates that the helicopter could have had several ground contact.
After a minute search into an area outside the restricted area of the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the unscrupulous structure of the aircraft was damaged against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico's Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Pregnancy in Childhood and Youth", with which genetic markers should be found in connection with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Biochemica (Department for Medical Research, Biochemistry Focus) at the Hospital Hospital de Specialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students from postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports pitches of IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday begins at 8.00 p.m. test with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Sports Square of Cuauhtémoc (in the West of the Federal State of Mexico) and has continued since 8 October at the Sports Square of Nezahualcóyolt (in the East of the Federal State of Mexico).
If the objective of 500 to 600 researchers has been achieved, the study will continue at the sports centre of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed at Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify the risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he explained that it will be sought that three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 should be satisfied with the consent and under the supervision of their parents on nutrition issues.
You will also be asked questions about your physical activity and your family history of illness in order to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He further explained that during those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, size), their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes related to obesity in children).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out due to the concerns of health personnel about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of healthy boys has increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity has increased by 47 percent. Overweight has also increased dramatically," said IMSS specialist.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He said that an (e) Mexican (in) average of 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African descent was reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are forced into the inability to burn out the excess of the energy (calorie) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigators were contained in a comprehensive survey of the children, in which it would determine whether they showed a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin swelling in the neck and the inner arm (akanthosis), which indicates the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the prestadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the results of the measurement and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, most of the time of the day before the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) together with high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
UNAM Asphalt Prevents Hits
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM University of Mexico, develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs from the road surface were to be taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 hitholes if the rainy season in the Metropolitana del Valle de México area of the valley of Mexico broke out, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and ensured that if the clearance and maintenance of the asphalt surface are adequately reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation "Technical blowholes", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Mr Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of the road surface and to avoid the occurrence of shock holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most difficult part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound from which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic numerical behavior.
The numerical behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquid, at 120°C it is very fluid and at 50°C, while it is broken at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not the same, but changes on one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer concluded.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road cover consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the top layers is a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalt-bathed and then solidified stones.
Each single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of power in the road cover.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"On the layer of wear," he said, "a last layer is designed, the so-called layer of wear consisting of small stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
This road cover receives and distributes most of the forces, also requires a suitable thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors, especially water", he said, "because it affects the conduct of the wear layer significantly.
When the ground is wet, water enters into the layer and only becomes difficult again. This causes a diversion of all layers of the road surface and consequently the appearance of impact holes.
When a blowhole occurs, he said, "the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs."
The member in the System Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important reason for the occurrence of impactors. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface should always be relative to the vehicle load and it should be ensured that this system is respected to avoid frequent impactors.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still pending, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the impactors could easily and simply repair themselves without applying high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty when giving the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium to show a silver crown and the band she presents as a new Miss Colombia.
With this night's result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department is already on 14 mistlets and Melina joins in the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the well-known Masses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The great question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the downfall of a great favourite who had shown at each performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia. It was not in vain that she was chosen to be the queen of the police and Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, a title that also had been given by the beautiful queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is crucial to the jury's decision to call her First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you the most and why?", which she was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca addressed the interrogator:
"I read a lot, I think pretty much the literature, I think it's kind of civilizing, finally I think that the book that touched the strongest for my childhood, 'The little prince' is a very deep book.
I am currently reading 'Shuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leads'.
An answer that was in little opposition, first because of the term 'scivilisation' and second because it had not explained specifically how each of her book she had influenced.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the love of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the favourite who had received all the chance and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Oster, a public vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous what the queen stressed, which could not shine on the stage."
And this was seen in her first performance in the bathroom on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in her two lifts at the Crown Festival.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and strength that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN thought that the fact that Melina was crowned as a miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not eventually become queen".
Valle also went to the end of the press from the road - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the main feature of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason already that two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beautifulness alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You must look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already cooperated before participating in the competition for projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriere and the fibrosis she noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutrition habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which was hardly noticed to me, pushed her score the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine of opinion, the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body was never her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this price, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the performance in the bath suit, a cruel forecast was created that should come true in the night. It was changed that Raymondo Melina had given a comfort price so as not to let them come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is now in her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent on behalf of Colombia’s National Beauty Competition in one of the international competitions.
However, she will enter the story as one of the queens who, in spite of her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had taken the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophospist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a Lophospist of the State Prosecutor's Unit (CTI) from Cali confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionaryas de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, Elizar González had been in the service this week, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to travel five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000, he moved to Valle over and after completion of the required courses and specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of the attack against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliezer was advised to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he flew from Palmira to Cauca in the helicopter.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the men who had led the oldest Guerrilla of the world could be. Therefore he should take the 10-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most investigation, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, for he compared the images he had seen in the mass media to not at all.
He had no beard, was like a farmer dressed in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp compared to Eleazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He saw it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On Search
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the honor given by President Juan Manuel Santos Santos Elizar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an accurate science without error rate that can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false evidence or they do not have it.
We take their fingerprints off and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house when he stole it, because the thief had stood right in this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the loss of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, suspects can also be discharged or charged.
Recently, a dead person was found surrounded by bottled bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be factually suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint was agreed on on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it will be linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktylscopist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or band will be used for reception.
Then the prints are sent to the Asaph, that is the criminal database, or to the personal office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without evidence," said the expert from the CTI.
He didn't mean everything was as it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as gold is not everything that shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if a corresponding comparison is carried out.
The "impacts" call out the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zuccotti square.
A large part came to the room command and changed its location into a nearby park.
On Tuesday, the members of the Occupy Wall Street movement called out the New York authorities when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been cleared from the square in the morning and tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the Zuccotti Square, where they were in a court order that allowed the "scattered" to enter the tent again. Meanwhile, another part of the movement to the room command remained and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the spot, we will meet somewhere else and continue the fight with legal means to return to the Zucotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the "Ocupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the answer of the "Emperes" to the room of her tent camp, which was ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, was brought before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent space of the site and authorized the demonstrators to the tent.
In addition, the "Empors" occupied a new park that connects New York and New Jersey on the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue all the way into the Dutch tunnel, and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. But then the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can't give any exact numbers. He assured the news agency Ephe that among them he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have been found in this place, where a survey of religious leaders has also been made as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zucotti Square (a site in private property) remains closed pending a judicial hearing which is still set up for this Tuesday and which will analyse the legality of the room in the morning.
Some of the demonstrators from the scene brought copies of this court order and distributed them. They even gave some police officers who were watching the scene, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had shown that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities, members of Occupy Wall Street from disposing of the place and the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg points out in front of the press that due to this judicial arrangement the reopening of the place for public transport and the demonstrators has been suspended. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-enter this place with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the room of the Zucotti Square, which was held in the morning, with almost 200 persons, and which was decided because the demonstrators "opposed the law."
Bloomberg explained that he would have given the order to clear the place because it had " turned into a place where people had not come to demonstrate but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The room in the morning's gray was gross and shows that Bloomberg is primarily interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to remember the two months the protests have been taking since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the young woman Maria in the TV show.
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model at a Canadian television Christmas show will be the Virgin Mary.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the "croner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and a very special young woman Maria will live.
CTV today distributed images of the television program, in which Anderson – also for the Internet distribution of a porno itself, in which she appeared together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee – as a young woman Mary with a doll in the shot to represent Jesus.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian comedian, recently worked as a moderator at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" broadcast by Charlie Sheen as a child.
CTV's Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who does not stand apart from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian "Hour".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake that triggered an atomic crisis, and the worst catastrophe Japan had experienced since World War II.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to $300 000, a blow that seems to slow down despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September were intended to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The refurbishment can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital plants listed from January to March, the first decline after six months of unsustainable growth.
Nevertheless, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keysian attacks that are taking advantage of the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is particularly alerted to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, due to the increasing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The label for the link to the website of the program
Tokyo has relied on the domestic market, after the Yen - the Japanese currency - has fled to one of the "flight currencies" of the investors who fled before the eurozone debt crisis and the desperate forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is loaded like a tombstone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September to the Yen's listing.
While the markets continue to cover the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is growing.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid re-evaluation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, the State Secretary of Economic Policy yesterday.
The prospects are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown more clear signs of slowing down economic development.
The indicator that presupposes the turning points of the world economy made it clear that the biggest economic potential would be the brake.
Because he dropped by four tenths to the los 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is at 100 after it has been reduced by eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens lets doubt arise again
Papadimos says the savings measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
Greece continues to be confused in the labyrinth with the risk premiums of the periphery and widespread uncertainty resulting from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels as a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days that were too short for his appointment, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new savings measures and that his request for new elections would not be withdrawn until February 19th.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the 26th October summit," Papadimos said yesterday to open up a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package with 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for officials and new measures to combat tax evasion.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not resolve his doubts: "We have committed ourselves to support the Transitional Government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organisation that needs to unlock the 8000 million Athens urgently needed, and he made it clear that he would not agree to a declaration of commitment on the implementation of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreou referendum, once again confirmed yesterday that it would not be necessary to get involved in its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika " very soon" came back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is still no final date.
The Greek noodle still has for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position on this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of small-scale financing".
The Queen of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has developed into the second donor worldwide for this fund for international cooperation. Its "beings" are based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in people".
Yesterday, the Queen dedicated the fifth World Summit on Small Credits to Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to reach the thousands of years' worth of money from the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the target of people living with incomes of less than a dollar per day, i.e. below the poverty line".
Spain "keeps working" on the expansion of the network of beneficiaries "to the last corner of the world and it is responsible for this task," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit to Thursday are guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poor and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have had many successes" and "is facing many challenges."
The Summit on Small Credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be intended that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
The concept of small loans goes back to Spain and the rest of the world on the "way initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago" that Queen Sofia considers as an "Act of Justice and Recognition".
She described the father of this financing instrument as a "beautiful idealist who has been responsible for the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the spot.
This experience was followed one year later by the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday, declared the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as "rapporteur of the poor".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical command"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to link development aid to times of economic booms, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small loans were a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now work "more than ever" on solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, small loans are one of the "main forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, called "the success", "marginated" people, "who are always at the front of closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opened "your door, filled with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, died for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democrat Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not included in the programme, but was implemented in autumn, in particular in order to provide sufficient support to those activists who consider the government policy on Greece today and perhaps Italy to be too late tomorrow.
The proposal from the Presidency of the European Commission was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted, ten abstained.
The several minutes of standing ovation, which was first seen by Angela Merkel and several hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, were not open to any doubt since the three European-customed finance ministers.
The principal idea of the Chancellor - as well as the applications - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a break in Europe".
This could be reflected by a revision of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the euro area countries, strengthening the control of the European Union; however, this could be done in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schauble Pate.
Surely it is only unlikely that 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is against the thing, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is set.
The delegates in an overwhelming majority also rejected the proposal to weigh each country in the Governing Council in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which apparently resulted in a strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who was concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty that would criticise the arrogant Germany without delay.
As far as the European application for the importance of the "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel France does not call the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of reports of disease?
According to family aid, UMP and government are now attacking the reports of disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family aid fund and to give a talk on the subject of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence by the state - which has been constantly going on since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the effort to bring the economy into a hard test, but on the other hand, it does not represent less than the preconditions of a right-wing presidential campaign, the majority would like to concentrate on employee health notices.
First, with budgetary objectives: the Government indicates the introduction of a fourth quarter of a day prior to taking into account a report on health in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a disabled worker would lose his salary for four days without the approval of the specific company, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
An assumption that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to be sworn off, but would help bring in EUR 280 million.
And the more symbolic nature of another acquisition is that the public officials have a non-remunerated day of quarantine in the event of illness (until now, unlike the three quarantine days in the private sector, there is no period of quarantine).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority are also re-evaluating the subject of fraud, which is aimed at the abuse of employment.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and in addition these are to be reimbursed if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, in front of the RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of sickness messages appear to be a little unproportional.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 as well as of political offensives that have borne the most frequent fruit.
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, first we are living with the country-wide figures.
According to the CNAM National Hospital Fund, more than 237 million Euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the annual meetings in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
Of this, 46% fell as regards maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% as regards sickness leave, which amounted to €6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted on average only 14.5 hospital days, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
One average, which doubts some differences: another, in 2007, published by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of 40,000 people in question indicated that they had not taken a single day of illness.
Another study, this time recorded by sickness insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% over.
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers do not tend to be incapacitated.
A long-term study conducted by two French-State Research Centre (CNRS) in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absence (caused by disease or elsewhere) was oscillated between 10% and 11% in France and 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness is a very small part of the problem of black work.
Only a weak ausmav is reached here on the issue.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls in cases of disease messages that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the training and further training of technicians and engineers) found that 13% of the 285,000 of the reported, short-term, disease reports, which was reported in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the case of systemicly controlled cases of more than 45 days duration, the figure was 1.2 million 11% of "uncorrected or unwarranted" cases, which amounted to 132.000.
Overall, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have applied for a health report.
A figure that represents only a weak scale compared to, for example, those of black work.
According to the UMP Member Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profits per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the fraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced to Parliament in addition to the fact that his government did not admit hundreds of days from the Union to carry out this task.
"In order to continue our efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme for budgetary adjustment," the chief of government, in his first public speech, explained in opening the debate on Parliament's confidence in Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the euro area meeting on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the eurozone "is at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos planned to reduce the country's government deficit by 9% of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 15.7% in 2010 and 2009.
The right to refuse the new strains
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had given his consent to the already approved acquisitions in relation to an attempt to recover from the debt crisis, but provided that his party would not agree to an additional withdrawal.
"We will not vote in favour of new elections," he said at a meeting of Members of his party, New Democracy.
He had been willing to declare himself ready with the requirements for reducing budget deficits and debts, as well as for combating waste, but any policy was hostile to that which would hinder economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with the economic and monetary tasks of the EU Commissioner who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of more than 8 billion euros without the written guarantee of all parties on their support for the planned acquisitions, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would be sufficient and he would not sign anything under the pressure of Auven.
Euthanasia and accompanied freedom must be legalized, as a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, as stated in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The Board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to painkillers in order to provide the best painkillers, and this also goes beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, linked to various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is made, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
The experts cite a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th grade, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, so tell us the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of Canadians to die at home, however, lastly 68.6% of those in the hospital die.
The rate of death in Quebec is the highest with 86% of deaths in the hospital.
On the issue of Euthanasia and associated suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that the position of the federal government, which has already exercised, does not intend to make any changes to the criminal law on Euthanasia and associated suicide.
However, there is no evidence, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalised or decriminalized Euthanasia and associated suicide, that such decriminalisation would lead to abuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or associated suicide by uncompromising or inadvertent persons.
On the contrary, there have been substantially more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasis is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Suizid accompanied is also practiced in Canada, although this is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canada Supports Euthanasia
We are aware that according to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already been trained in favour of Euthanasia, since they believe that it allows people at the end of their way of life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the relationship of legalization of Euthanasia does not lead to the message that the life of older or disabled people is less valuable.
As regards persons who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the respondents represent 41% of the view that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintaining or setting up the funds in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, says the author of the report.
They also point out in their recommendation list that it should be stated in the criminal law that the suspension of the funds for which a valid refusal has been made should not be regarded as criminal.
In addition, the Expert Board calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a drop in funds at the end of life, and must fear this without criminal prosecution.
The Board stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to painkillers treatment to provide the best painkillers, and this also goes beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to the funds already used in the Canadian institutions for the care of health, the Board calls for a reduction of pain or life-long loss to be taken into account, at least as little as the euthanasia used to reduce physical pain and relate to the same procedures.
Preservation of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in health law, has defined the position of the reporting experts as "extreme", among other things, because they do not set any limits on euthanesis practice in patients in the end phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and is over 18 years old is asking another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deshamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deshamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to place individual responsibility over all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But, as he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she cited as "Pro-Euthanasia Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the reports on the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan summons President Assad to join power
Damascus handles a plot
Syria is more isolated in view
The partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auven ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, thanks to Russia's support, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Syrian Arab League's summit, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of a presidential resignation of Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan yesterday was the Arab Prime Minister, who had called for President Baschar al-Assad to "submit his power in Syria", where about forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Baschar were to put the interest in his country in his heart, he would retreat, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," says the King of Jordan, neighboring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, had complained that since the beginning of the year, Turkish mediation attempts had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who cannot be in peace with their people and who cannot be satisfied with them must go," he explained in a play on Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey takes an increasingly harsh attitude.
On the other hand, the United States has confirmed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime's machinations" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone in view of the repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two other civilians were killed in the sheltered city of Homs, according to this NGO.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mullim was nevertheless the view that the country "taxed at the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted with emphasis on the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which represents a "dangerous step" in its assessment.
Syria "will not be granted," he added under the rule that "the plots against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Auven trade minister Alain Juppe also spoke in favour of sending UN observers in order to protect themselves from the regime's repressions, after which he was trapped in his "Paranoia", protecting himself.
A super-planned re-assembly of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on crisis relief decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, foreseeable withdrawal of the military troops from the cities in siege and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Auven minister Sergey Lawrow referred yesterday to the Arab League's decision as "inaccurate" to protect himself from any sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to prepare for sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future head of the Italian government, has taken the market a little longer to form his staff and implement a program that calls for "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiations with the political parties before today's trade unions and employers.
It was his job to call a cabinet into Parliament, which consists of relatively strict external technocrats.
"Monti spoke about an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had agreed to wait until Friday for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The talks will culminate in the presentation of a mailing list presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the Chief of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the rigid nervousness of stock exchange and bond markets called for their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", in order to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed that it was "certain that markets would be wise and prudent".
His order by the President was confirmed by the market, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister was to set up a staff consisting of major technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only be in place until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's assurance by Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself since taking up his role to work in all urgency in order to make Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even in the light of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the savings that have been made in recent months, has in particular applied for new measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, the head of the leaders of Italy, who will meet in Monti on Tuesday, is also on the need for economic convergence" since a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch-change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "responsibility challenge" and another "Italy", according to the literary authors.
The rough unknown is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-elections, as Italy has now reached 200 billion euros of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wyatschelaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-based sprayer, so on Monday, an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recently published report of the International Atomic Safety Agency IAEA and other documents issued by this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA had announced its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the IAEA documents since ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had been working in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to set up a company in Kiev that created "Nano Diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the IAEA referred to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosive system was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only too mobile in this technology, but also, as a member of the Agency reported, his entire professional career on this technology had worked directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes against Muslims and crimes have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religious-motivated crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, either slightly decreased or only slightly increased.
According to this data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, whereas 13% of the violence against Catholics, 4% of the decrease in crimes against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes were recorded.
The total number of "hass-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in very weak Mave, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes growing again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights law," added Paul Legendre, a member of the organization.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these violations," he added, under the assumption that this could be done in improving the police's attitude towards the "hate crimes".
The "Hass crime" is in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish violent acts directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now includes crimes of sexuality.
Twitter changes the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their posts, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enables better live reading to reflect the activities of other "twitterer", the internet user whose news ("Tweets") you are pursuing and who follow your messages.
This allows them to determine whether they are able to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August at a low percentage of users", Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its few instincts Functioning, works with something esoteric anmutendem Wordlaut (RT to the referenced repeat of someone else's contributions). follow Friday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiators, s'avre a wider audience with a more comparable handling a that of the big public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, urgent and as much as Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden budgetary rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the ruling government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria decided to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in the Austrian Top Bonoity (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, i.e. far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay was not reduced to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest every year," argued Michael Spindeleger, vice-cancer and Christian Minister of Auven.
Austria also holds a request for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would then have required the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public balance in the constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
This is similar to the "German model", because Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year; from 2017 onwards, the Federal State’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% GDP ceiling, whereas the regional states should also have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we were to attach excessive volatility" to the Yen exchange rate, we would intervene just as we did last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again speeded up close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced on 31 October to intervene.
On that day Tokyo had sold massive yen against the dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which has been setting a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the Yen has increased regularly over this, baptized by purchases of investors who view the Yen as "flight value" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the level that had been the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was recorded for the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income derived from Japanese companies abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake as well as the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who is afraid that this strain of Yen could kill the weak uphill already in the Keme.
The third economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year, has been the result of the booming export gains and the consumption of the household once again generated by the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that Yen's commitment is not reflecting "the economic foundations of Japan".
On the other hand, Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Committee on Tuesday, to take all the groundbreaking assumptions to unlock the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, however, noted that BoJ had already introduced "appropriate acquisitions" in order to allow him to say that there was no additional currency closure on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Notentbank had increased its public bond purchases by around 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) that it had spent on various purchases of financial assets in order to overcome the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast in height, exchanges make retreat
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly eliminating the European figures.
Despite the entry into office of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also operating on this Tuesday, November 15, a little more in negative fields.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt went back by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Because of the new tensions with regard to the return on state bonds in which the eurozone is in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent gains.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of ignition," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, in turn, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants about Europe’s capacity to continue the debt crisis, has closed with a base of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone damages the unit currency that continues its base on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for about half a month.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, so it remained at 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, she withdrew after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had made an application, which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish councils are far below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain's loan rates remain at a very alarming level.
This Tuesday morning, the Italian bond income reached 6.85% at 10 years of age, and that of the Spanish title grew to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to address the fears of investors.
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the market view as the country's parliamentary elections take place on Sunday.
The "spread" between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical height.
Expecting eurozone growth rates
According to the statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the basis of the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most economic experts are concerned about.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first increase in the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it examines the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to give up on a vital element.
At the same time, we need to soften the reduction of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate change.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just intended to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
On the other hand, the United States has decided to join Fukushima in joining its park by re-launching the work of Three Mile Island, which was closed after the nuclear accident.
Even though the German model, which is targeted at renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as an example, the reality is contrary to the speech.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of a pollution of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on imports, in particular from Russia, resulting in an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will already become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to thinking.
On the one hand, Denmark is a European wind energy table driver, which accounts for 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, the country is one of the most powerful users of coal and gas, using wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role in competitiveness and a stable position of industry on national soil, the French companies benefit from the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, resulting in the noble statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The polls showed that the price that the gross majority of the French are willing to pay was as little as it would show resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We welcome the fact that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them a source of countless jobs.
If France were to decide to rise from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment and nuclear energy exports would collapse.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years if the decline of its manufacturer is pre-programmed?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is as little a miracle as a devil's work to produce electricity.
The solutions developed by Areva, the CO2-poor solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have carried out a security authority that has carried out the uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who, because of their professionalism, have made a name, are to be possessed of the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major disturbances.
Only one, although in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions; thus he suffered no consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was denounced by reactor construction as well as by innocuous human defeat.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a number of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it did from the past.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German nuclear power plants operators and designers, the EPR is a draft that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electric technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a buildingtop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to travel freely to the leading position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party leaders dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is Immigration Last or Chance for the Economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised for many ways - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy that has been subject to numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had advocated.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students on the official side had marked weekly shows, which the Minister of Interior had announced at the time (see Liberia of 23 May) that France "needed no talent, maurice or waiter from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
On this subject, there is a broad consensus between rights and left.
On the right hand, the sound of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, were not allowed to pose a problem for a country", said Michel Rocard, who had shown 1990, "France cannot take up the whole poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of gravity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Hurds of Polish Kempner was divided in 2005 by both right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were regarded as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of rudeness that immigrants are willing to face.
Francois Hollande restricts himself in his programme to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron put it in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration flows on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigrant countries.
Restricting immigration would undermine growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to replace domestic workers, especially those who are less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact far more complementary than domestic wage workers, since they carry out heavy-duty jobs in sectors that are technically unloaded.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where domestic workers do not travel, which are more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthetists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wage and domestic labour market access between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flows would result in an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is affordable (higher proportion of immigrants who are immigrants under American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute netly to social systems, in European countries on average at about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who is an immigrant to Germany at the age of 30 will, on average, contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to present the missing interfaces "with the teeth" to the arrival of his mandate.
However, these said teeth that should frighten immigrants achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should remember itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy all the time over their enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon that it was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient for this and can also well be the "repressive instrument" as expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of violence, education, education, economic and social community, a rule of law.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True-Falsian referendum would have had in this regard double-exclusive character: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those who are concerned about their inability to make it impossible.
This ambivalentity should be considered excessive.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organised according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A freelance for the European single rulers or a jump with connected eyes into the void of nationalist retreat: a generous choice for the citizens!
No, we want hackers, but a collective task, with full right, declared and constantly, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we no longer know where to end the census - because there is only one crisis, and this is ruled by Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is bent on the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers under its power and its lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that is losing its sovereignty gradually, and so each of its member nations.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the people's sovereignty.
Because it is up to all Europeans to reduce their debt burden, to free themselves from the markets and to promote a future through investment.
The escalation from the crisis has decisions at European level on a condition that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without sure leading us to ruin.
Once Jacques Delors and the Socialists have fought this proposal for a long time, everyone today is forced by the European economic direction.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it presupposes citizens - would be a new tortoise and another pocket gas.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European national sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chips cards become the general good
The world fair for chip maps opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (EC cards, SIM cards) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the wireless technology that allows payments in public transport or compensation for purchases by simply holding the card on a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold this year, 460 million uncontacted chips cards should be sold worldwide!
Its market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global chip map market (6,925 million cards).
Europe will win the groundless payment after the Asia-Pacific region has been abandoned for a long time.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 visa-free visas have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
It is now necessary for banks to provide their customers with these cards in order to increase their speed.
"Two gross French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out their customers in the future, with no contact with the chip," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A decreasing percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should experience real progress at least next year."
"We count in 2012 on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows no contact payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer that allows their customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist front is understood, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm themselves.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria had now reached "certainty".
"The way in which both organisations deal with and the relationship between the secret services are reflected in clear cooperation," he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The surveys on the removal of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have promoted interfaces to days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who was kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were to have been killed on the following day, at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips that were part of the terrorist in the drums at the site.
Terroristachse
The analysis of the phone calls conducted leads to several partners who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are interested in the numbers of two partners in particular: a number leads to a Nigerian who had stopped for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the bay of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that you have to wait for more clear evidence before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"It's possible, however."
"It has been known for years that the sector has been engaged in financial and intellectual support from Auven and that it has been increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their course, as have the claims as well as the operation modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the withdrawal of suicide killers and the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been putting pressure on Abuja to start with Washington to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact regarded the grouping as a Community of Illuminati, which should not be given particular attention.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf – which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a disgrace" – follows the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, integration is rapidly successful.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for the Sharia, while its associated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the viewer.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activists were particularly active in their increased attacks on the Commission’s Office.
However, the reaction from Abuja is as usual indifferent.
The army rounds the city, you count 800 dead.
The Mohammed Joseph who was arrested is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes radical and leaves its castles in the north.
Last Christmas she became known as an assassination in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram will be blamed for a suicide bombing that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations' local seat was set on the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Somalia, has been disturbing to all security experts.
While Aqmi Mali and Niger have occupied Somalia's operation of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppe warned President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria about a conversation he had with Boko Harem and was ready to give "all the information".
The world represented by the Republican presidential candidates
In the middle of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and Israel.
Can a crisis-depressed America have a complex world with easy to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days now, the middle of Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their rivals have repeatedly made their generous statements and their statements regarding Auven policy, the traditional republican focus.
About China, Iran and the help of Israel - often underwalled in no way - Slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest level in the course, the middle of Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and expose them to the "currency manipulation" - a leading theme in an America - that was driven to the highest by the migration of all industrial branches to Asia.
Stupid run when this is supposed to imply the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auven politics, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions of humor.
He had called for a hand-held but constructive exchange with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman will not be heard because he is stagnant in the depth of the polls.
Reagan's even image
Romney had also believed in military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll offer the Iranian support," he said.
"When Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
By the way, he had promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance and had called on Obama to remain guilty of this partner's obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranking candidate, wears a shameful act of ignorance.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered as Beijing "try to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to note the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, insists on being prepared to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The 2009 Obama-banned backlog of torture attacks against mutative terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
You are far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auven political weight.
Against the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and nevertheless won the Cold War.
They recalled that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which covered the subject of anti-terrorism.
They maintain the right to the failure of his naive two-talk with Iran, the earlier withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also led to him calling the weak.
However, this hostility is not so forced.
The population estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which turned Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq, it has been protecting itself from military intervention that leads to the elaboration.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America must be rebuilt economically in order to raise its leadership position to a new life.
North Stream, new door to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is expected to deliver gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to do this event with splendor and glory.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have spent the last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea Coast during orchestral talk and at a fine-tasting buffet of the dedication of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte, have symbolically combined the control of the valve, which transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gases per year are to be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km long, connecting the region of St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you can already relate the possibility of building a third line on the same track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge construction works works as a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any passage through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the ground.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it will now be harder for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest in the debate, was not reluctant to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of strengthening European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has almost five years to complete its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas developments tend to fluctuate.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon at the dedication of the gas pipeline, pointing to the extent to which the gross gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the gasprom manager represented in Lubmin regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, about 200 m deep.
In its construction, the Second World War had to be balanced by dateing fields of mines.
"Approximately a hundred mines had to be carefully removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of North Stream.
Aufverdem had to be seized by reinforced dams to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, hard like 242 eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned before the Swedish coast, but the project managers took a distance from it, as the Swedish had little intention of seeing a Russian state society sit permanently at the height of their coasts.
"In the case of an accident, we close the gas tunnel in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas line so escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers as only unlikely since the swivel was estimated to be resistant to a leak per 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both a underwater robot controlled for external observation by a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigarette, a meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformation of the metal when it arrives.
The gas line was designed to operate for fifty years without having to be subjected to the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF are also included here (any to 15.5%), as are the Dutch gas union and the French company group GDF Suez (any to 9%).
These five companies have formed a company called Nord Stream which is commissioned with the construction and operation of the gas line.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has thus leased the full capacity of its gas transport, on a long-term 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, just as gross the real transporter gas volume is falling," Jens Müller said.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are forced to reintroduce their statements, since Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas line comes at a sandy, pine-forested coastal line near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas austritsforte.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other signs of the occurring gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal is supplied with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand-notic book.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to reinstate his style of writing.
It has a flair of adventure, with candle-certified hours of writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber tape, the egg-coloured pages, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine Notebook, as we know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, now decided to place a distinctive design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant of the company, is commissioned with the introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an alternative production technique, called Mole Skin (Maullwurfschaut), which is called a cotton varnish, for example, used for references to pulse benches.
This type of notebook was very asked by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has made an old and almost forgotten object come back to life, which until the 20th century was considered the icon of avant-garde artist," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsible for fashion.
Success occurred.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increase by 26% and are established with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to produce a phantom image of the buyers, since the notebook also inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and understands how to implement its identity.
"We have followed the spirit and its new writing requirement, which exists despite the uplifting of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: The brand recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg) " in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the Film Festival in Locarno, the company also placed a link with Leoparden patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and understood how to diversify his products: pockets, calendars, fillers, computer holes... The brand shows the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that the Netherlands plans: In the fall of 2006, Mode was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% of the total population.
Discouragement?
"No, this is how Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association Adaptive, points out the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"No matter how much remains to be done."
However, it has to be said that many obstacles continue to exist for disabled people before they get a job.
More common are the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no Abiur and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% of the disabled are on average 38%.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and that constitute the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplín, an association founded in 1992 that is helpful to the companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the real brakes.
Remains unspoken, the mental attitudes that are certain but slowly developing.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Entrepreneurship Association for the La Cité magazine reported that the managers in question have "a low level of knowledge about the disabled", which is "overrepresentated" as "from persons in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual minorities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to reach the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, as defined in a 1987 Act.
These last-mentioned figures from 2008 refer to a 2.6% quota.
"We are now with the 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for making contributions from companies that failed to comply with this law.
The evidence: The number of "paying fees" at the farm has decreased as well as the amount of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also brings true recognition, in particular, of the gross groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the jobs between 20 and 49 employees are unemployed, while companies with between 100 and 199 employees are 82%.
Hazard: "What a fortune"
Even before they offered the "Blue Service Officers (20:45 p.m.) the stars, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not given them their pleasure, which brought them the friendship game.
It would have been too far-reaching to say there had been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic bands.
Side by side on the stage of the city of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been happy to make peace.
Five months after the temperamentful gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had no praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgium".
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his performance at the club and national self"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille, I've spent all year in what's not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, released on Friday against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally "gloss".
However, without leaving the note of "satisfaction".
The French national team has been on fire since the age of 7, leading its victorious fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this meeting.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
"We've just been on our way."
"Unlike them to play means gross happiness!"
On his side, the corpse was called "stoll" with kindness.
"The pride of a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbor" - that France "has become a very high-level team" and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job," he exclaimed.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the Blues (the French National Self) ... and towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out grossly," he stressed.
"We're planning a thing that players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice what's going on with the games." The game against France is involved.
Portugal very reliable
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the replay against Bosnia (2:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the example, the two teams had missed out on business.
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selectçao", his national self, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a game to play, and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the illustration (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was not able to push the key stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, however, which poses a certain risk, as we have not achieved an external bulk."
However, at home, in their bright city of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that before a public who should be as big as the game, they should be beaten, even if the party was of course announced as "very short", the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very short match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
The decisionless in Bosnia on Friday forced the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
An indecision can already suffice the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, however, which poses a certain risk, as we have not achieved an external bulk," says Bento.
"We will join a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had already set out to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "no time to think about it."
A good idea, provided it is implemented this time.
