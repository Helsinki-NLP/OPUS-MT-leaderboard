But I'm having a hard time breathing.
But I know a lot of people are messing with me.
but we must approach the treatment of any chest pain with maximum seriousness
But you're breathing well now, aren't you?
Because I don't remember this chest pain anymore.

I think it's a flu.
I think it's a flu in a light form.
Does this remind you that a very heavy man is sitting on your neck?
all of this started almost at the same time with major pain and increased temperature
I'm experiencing chest pain.
It sounds like a chest pain
It's in my chest.
It's in the center of my chest.

From time to time, I feel a little pain in my chest
Well, do you have any other symptoms besides pain?
Or is someone sitting on your chest?
exactly the same high temperature and cough, headache and muscle pain
pain directly in the center of my chest
Show me this picture where you feel pain
Because you have a high temperature.
So you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So, do your children have any of those same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain
Temperature increases at night

where you feel this pain in your chest
You feel something like a tightness in your chest
You know, I have diabetes and all that.
You said you were experiencing this chest pain.
The rapidly increasing incidence of COVID-19 in the European Union and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
Cumulative coronary disease (COVID-19) has similar trends in the Euro-Union/European Economic Area and in Britain, thus confirming that, despite various stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care facilities, it is necessary to increase the level of preparedness for the flow of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of unknown theology of pneumonia were recorded in Uhana province of Hubei.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronation now known as type 2 severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) was a source of infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become a coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have mildly developed diseases, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, most of whom are cured.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form of hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study analyzes trends in COVID-19 cumulative disease in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in Britain with data on Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and United Kingdom
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the remaining parts of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria under which WHO identified the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of whom returned from Mr. Uhana of the province of Hubbay.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, with 39 768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, including 1,441 deaths from fatalities, were recorded for the period from 31 December 2019 to that date.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative disease COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily updates data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of those countries, national and regional health management bodies and WHO.
These data are used to analyze trends in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in Britain and to compare them with data on Italy.
COVID-19 was estimated to be a 14-day COVID-19 cumulative disease, taking into account the usual flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country for 8:00 15 March 2020 compared with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the development of COVID-19 infected cumulative disease for a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and in Britain in general corresponded to the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative COVID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom generally started to grow about 21 February, and a sharp leap of this indicator (additional material) occurred on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of registered diseases in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain to increase COVID-19 cumulative disease (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 diseases in EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain compared to the similar figure for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of recorded COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in Britain.
The observed trends in COVID-19 cumulative disease suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in various countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of disease cases and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of the availability of COVID-19, including “reversing” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 require intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care facilities in these regions were already fully filled.
Currently, data on the incidence of COVID-19 patients in the hospital and/or in the EU/EEA intensive treatment unit are available only for 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not reported).
However, such data should be systematically collected in order to supplement the current monitoring data subject to the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to the 2010-2011 study, there was a significant spread in the number of chickens in intensive care and care facilities in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 in intensive treatment and intensive care facilities for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The ECDC's sixth update on risk assessment results for COVID-19 presents scenarios for the charging of health system resources with assessment data on hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in Britain, where the risk of lack of available chickens in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As the cases are currently grouped into certain regions of EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment offices usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of cows in intensive treatment offices is recommended to provide as much as possible on the 2nd level of the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care facilities should be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2, a long-term non-depressant contact scenario and for the increase in patients with COVID-19 in need of medical attention and, in particular, intensive therapy, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As the ECDC's latest report on risk-assessment reports indicates, an operational, preventive and integrated approach to curbing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is important because, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases in decision-makers and hospitals, it may simply not be time to consider, take and adjust their response accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of the risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the next few days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries, patients will be faced with the flow of intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronary infection 2019 (CVID-19) caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of a severe severe respiratory syndrome in thousands in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 differs from the lower severity of the disease and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affects older people more often than young people and men more frequently than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new diseases, this article proposes an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, hetology, virology, diagnostics, treatment, prognosis of further flow and prevention of this disease.
While the answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eliminate dangerous diseases.
The spring holiday (Chinese New Year), which was released on 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay at home during and for weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
Taking into account the high level of coronal virus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called this virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease was coronal infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then in almost 50 other countries of the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified, more than 40,000 patients were healed and more than 3,000 patients were killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is an “enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months later, more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, hetology, diagnosis and treatment, were published, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronal virus caused by the disease, a coronal virus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss known facts about the prevention and forecasting of the flow of the disease at the moment, as well as some other issues that are not less pressing.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been pathogens that are not mortally dangerous to humans and mainly cause approximately 15 per cent of the total respiratory disease 4.
However, in this century, we have twice faced highly pathogenic human coronary viruses, namely severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and quickly spread to many other countries with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on the clusteres of cases of unknown pneumonia first came to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Augan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of death was registered in Ohan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly into neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medics was reported, suggesting the possibility of human transmission of the virus.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Uhan, and urban public transport ceased.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the market for marine products in Uhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from unknown animals.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the crown virus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
By the time the report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final extent and extent of the threat of the outbreak still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COPID-19 patients, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bldA).
All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but were mainly affected by people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, quite few were under 20, and only 14 were not yet 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was mainly a cluster in the Province of Hubei and in the nearby regions.
There were 5 (2-9) days on average from the time of occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms to the diagnosis.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From the time of onset of symptoms until death on average, 9.5 (4.8-13) days had passed.
The baseline (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons who had coincided with large-scale transport before the celebration of the New Year.
Mortality in diagnosed patients was 1.44 per cent (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and the corrected mortality rate in patients was 3.06 per cent (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subspecies of large cloud viruses containing one network of meaningful RNAs.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, from which alpha- and beta-kronaviruses are known to affect people.
In case of stroke of type SARS and MERS glycoprotein, cloud-like herbicides (S) are associated with cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptydylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by a virus RNA gene; after the viral gene is replication, the gene RNA, together with cloudy glycoproteins and nucleocapid proteins, generates viral tissues that then merge with the membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with a gene of 99.98 per cent that corresponds to 10 sequence samples collected in the first instance of outbreaks of the disease on the Juanan marine product market in Uganda.
Genetic SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERCS-CoV.
Using an e-microcopy of the SARS-CoV-2 particle were found in ultraviolet cuts of the respiratory epithelial.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2 human enzyme less than in SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have less severity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein, encoded orf3b, and secretified protein, encoded orf8.
The ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in terms of virus pathogen and suppress IFNβ expression; however, the ORF8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a collection of authors headed by Žhou (Zhou) reported on the cryoelectronic tomography of the full-size ACE2 human enzyme structure with a permit of 2.9 Å in combination with the B0AT1 carrier.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was collected as a diameter and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which served as evidence of the recognition and infection of the crown virus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for the administration of a medical box to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and interim owner
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV were flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to man through cattle and camels respectively.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronary viruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are flying mice, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronary viruses, namely those of flying mice SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of interim owner has become, which has enabled the virus to overcome the type of barrier and to infect humans; the route of transmission is still to be identified.
Mr. Zji (Ji) and his colleagues assumed that the vectors of the virus from flying mice to humans were snakes, in which the homologic recombination took place in S-protein.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou assumed that the Pangolines, long-term dairy farmers who are fed by ants and who are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99% genetic similarity between the Pangoline and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference in 1 per cent between the two genomes is very large, and it is therefore considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive for 48 hours in the dry environment and for up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent of the moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective blocking of virus activity may lead to air, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, percussion acid, chloroforms and other chlorohexidine-containing solvents.
The human population as a whole has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronal viruses, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the host virus first recognizes the immune system by means of imaging receptors (ORRs), including P-type lectine receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the formation of dendrite cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocyte of macrophages with regard to viral antigens.
However, the N-label SARS-CoV can prevent an immune reaction.
Adaptive immune reactions are soon included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of B-cell-specific anti-viruses, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, crown virus can inhibit the functions of T-cells by causing their programmable death.
Humorous immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies from a healthy patient have neutralized MERCS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperresponse of the immune system has led to the local education of a large number of free radicals, which could lead to serious damage to the light and other organs, and in the worst scenario, to poly-organism deficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster phenomenon, is more likely to affect elderly people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The possibility of infection above for those who are affected by a large number of viruses or have immune system violations.
According to the results of the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Oghan, the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on average for 3 days, with a distribution ranging from 0 to 24 days.
The study later described above, based on population data in 8,866, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the dates of quarantine measures introduced, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with a disease that is unsymptomatic.
In general, 14-day quarantine has become available for people who have contacts with the virus or who are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, dizziness, chest pain, diarrhoea, cough and redness.
In some patients a week after the start of the disease, the diagnosis and/or hypoxia were observed.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute illness should be tested for virus to detect early diagnosis even if there are no pathologies in the chest.
The demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 found the following symptoms prevalence indicators: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% dry cough, and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of light.
Similar results were obtained from two recent studies on the incidence of infection in the family and the transmission of the virus from non-symptoms.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV with major symptoms also high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and detection (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of light, much higher than in patients with COVID-19, and corresponded to a higher mortality rate than in COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99-100 per cent), dry cough (29-75 per cent), dry cough (40-42 per cent), diarrhoea (20-25 per cent) and throat pain (13-25 per cent), and artificial ventilation of patients is required 14-20 per cent.
As of 14 February, the death rate of COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66 576.
Compared to this, SARS mortality by November 2002 accounted for 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, the June 2012 demographic study showed mortality at 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of an earlier study, the baseline reproductive rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) from 5.71 to 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only in range from 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MRS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, levels of mortality and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show that SARS-CoV-2 is better able to spread compared to MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in the case of a new virus is lower than the last two.
Thus, maintaining the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic would be much more difficult than the Mers-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
There are often cases of infection within one family or group of people who have gathered together for some reason or who have come together on some transport, such as a cross-liner.
Patients often traveled to Oghan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted the infected or the sick during the last two weeks prior to the start of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the cured patients who have been released from the hospital may again become carriers of the virus, and this is a alarming signal for the extension of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced levels of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had leukocyte lymphopies < 4×109/L, including leukocytes < 1×109/L, as well as increased asparagine aminotransferase and virus levels.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, musculoskeletal enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood red blood cells were observed.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer was increased and the number of lymphocytes was continuously reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 in the X-ray study of the breast-cell were diagnosed with pathologies characterized by uneven dimming of both sides or fainting of the type of “matric glass” in the faeces.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe mild and severe respiratory disease (PFS).
In developing POPs, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of fluid and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Dysfunction of Type I and Type II tyres reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lighters to expand and increasing the risk of slight decreases.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray research often coincide with the most severe cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detection of pneumonia, the formation of gallin membranes and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the multi-nuclear synthetic cells in light patients who died from disease correspond to viral infection and ODP pathologies and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the detection method for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used through a polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcryptation (PCR with reverse transcryptation).
However, given the high level of false negative results that could speed up the development of the epidemic, a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations has begun in China since 13 February 2020 (not relying solely on the PCR with reverse transcriptase).
The situation with SARS was similar.
Thus, data on disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results are critical for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, a team of experts led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the SHERLOCK-based methodology protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this methodology allows for the detection of synthetic parts of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10–18 moles/L to 200 × 10–18 moles/L (10–100 copies per microlitre of the original sample) with the use of indicator strips less than the time without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if tested successfully in clinical medicinal products, can significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of tests.
Due to the lack of experience in the prevention of previously unknown coronal virus, physicians may, for the most part, only provide patients with COVID-19 with supportive therapy while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or proposed for the treatment of other coronal viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antivirals, immunosuppressants, steroids, healthy patients' plasma, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of healthy patients should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly light and may be less impactive by other bodies expressing ACE2, such as gastrointestinal tract and thighs.
However, violations of work and respiratory rejection are a major threat and cause of death.
Therefore, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of light subjects, is critical for the relief of symptoms and life saving.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporative membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonary circulation used to treat a life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, it is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2 to maintain a water balance, prevent and treat secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as to protect the functions of vital organs.
The cytokine storm is known to be the result of a hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is the form of a system burning process that develops in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNb, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immunocytes to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of POPs and poly-organism deficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients with severe conditions, immunosuppression is essential.
corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleukin-6 inhibitors have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune response to T-cell control; inhibition of the production of cytokines IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of janus-kinase; blinatumumab, cytokine 4 suppressors and hystondeacetase inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressors.
However, high-dose steroids do not benefit from the treatment of severe mild injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially ovarian osteonecrosis, which significantly aggravate the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
No effective anti-virus therapy has been confirmed at the time of the preparation of the document.
However, the internal introduction of a nucleotide analogue has been effective in treating American patients with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed anti-virus drug, originally developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, reddesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with one-off RNA, including Mers and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead has provided this medicinal product to China to conduct peer studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible options for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, dryness, redness, fever and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products should be monitored carefully.
Plasma of healthy patients and antibody development
Blood clotting in infected patients has been used for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the protection of the healthy population for a long time.
In fact, the blood of healthy patients often contains relatively high levels of antibodies to fight pathogen.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other international objects; they recognize and address individual molecules of pathogens and neutralize them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was derived from blood samples of a group of patients who were cured from COVID-19, which were then introduced to 10 patients with severe disease.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the intensity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and the blood saturation of oxygen increased.
However, in order to encourage the use of this method by the public prior to specific therapy, no verification and no explanations have yet been made.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully addressed.
For example, antibodies can exacerbate the immune system and cause cytokine emissions syndrome, which, in view of toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
Antibody concentrations are usually low and plasma is required to treat patients critically.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to address the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify the B cells of healthy patients and to identify the genetic code of active antibodies or to conduct screenings to find effective antibodies against critically important proteins of the virus.
So we're going to be able to get to mass production of antibodies right now.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, different from the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine theories.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have indefinite action, as identifying and checking these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Because of the lack of effective specific therapy of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has now become one of the main alternative treatment methods for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who recover from a severe stage of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Zze Du capsules (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest proportion of cured patients with COVID-19 was observed in several provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including Ghana (63.7%), Nancy (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the lowest proportion of cured patients (13 per cent) were recorded in Hubei Province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment of only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19.
However, this is a rather severe comparison, as the assessment should take into account the number of other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published the study materials, which compared treatment only with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in the hospital were less sensitive in patients treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated only in Western methods.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who started to suffer from symptoms (from mild to severe) was noted below in the group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4% compared to 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled research in larger and larger regions.
The specific interest is also to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine methods or their combination.
Patients who suspect or confirm the existence of COVID-19 are mainly afraid of acute and even fatal diseases, and quarantined people are also experiencing nausea, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms such as illness, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as sleeplessness from corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the outbreak of SARS-induced disease have reported a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor onset, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicide.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, including measures taken by health authorities to control the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's concern and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social inclusion in their families and friends.
Psychological and psychiatric assistance should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected and contacted, as well as to all others required.
Psychological support should form multi-profile mental assistance units, provide clear information with regular and accurate updating of information on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the transmission chain from vectors of infection and infected people to susceptible masters and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy used to control new viruses.
Work has been done on the establishment of S-protein-based vaccines aimed at the development of long-term and high-acting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live weakened vaccines from SARS viruses.
However, before clinical studies are started, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines should be determined in the natural environment when administered to elderly patients, the pattern of death-dose infection and the level of protection against zoonose virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported ever since.
At the same time, there are still sporadic cases and clusteres of diseases caused by the Mers virus, which are born in the Middle East and spread in other regions through the conservation of zoonic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies have been developed to combat MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, virus vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for persons with no immunity is an urgent and critical challenge that requires a solution to prevent the outbreak.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (on average 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic development of crown viruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical flow of the disease through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to establish a forecasting model of disease in order to prioritize the measures they have taken, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on the clinical studies currently submitted, the following factors may affect or be associated with the disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study 8 866 cases.
Patients who required intensive therapy were more likely to have baseline diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (on average 66 years versus 51 years), which showed that age was a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000) as mentioned above.
Sickness and complications: Patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe myocardial infarction and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to be associated with ACE2-positive holangiocytes, which could lead to a liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and baseline diseases are closely interlinked and can distort results.
The abnormalities identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor for the flow of the disease, the response to therapy and the final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the predictability of COVID-19.
In addition, an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine may also be predicted.
These enzymes are distributed in large quantities by various organs, especially by the heart and the liver, and their release occurs when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: X-ray data on the chest and development of time clinical symptoms should be taken into account in order to predict the results and complications of treatment with COVID-19 together with other factors.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressors widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Because corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors have developed osteonecrosis causing life-threatening disabilities and low quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are to be used to treat patients with COVID-19, they should be administered at small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen stress because they often have to endure long quarantine periods, deal with high uncertainty and watch their relatives and other patients die.
To relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support must be conducted.
According to demographic studies currently conducted, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract replication, SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronal viruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce into upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients with an early stage of disease or who have not yet completed their incubation period may, through their normal lives, spread the virus to a significant extent, which significantly impedes epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to take place when patients were severely ill, although in most cases there was no early infection.
Thus, today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and more difficult to control.
China is currently carrying out a major work in which the general quarantine in Oghan and neighboring cities has been declared, as well as an extended quarantine regime for virtually all populations introduced to stop the spread chain of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have been very damaging to the economy and other aspects of the country ' s life, the number of new patients is decreasing, which says that the epidemic is slowing.
The most optimistic estimates are that the outbreak of the disease will end by March and the phase of drowning will be extended for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which was much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) made up a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and assumed that SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
The Group of Canadian Experts reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in nose and throat masks taken from patients who were cured and diagnosed two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a similar cyclical influenza.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an effect.
According to initial projections, Ebola’s disease had to strike up to a million people and cause the loss of half a million patients.
But by means of strict quarantine and isolation, the disease finally came under control.
It is likely that, like SARS-CoV virus, which is infected by SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic human virus.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or chewing, as well as perhaps by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in the cage, which means that the oral and faecal way of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of 138 cases were reported to have been the result of an infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 patients.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreign patients.
The first line of defense in combating the risk of infection is wearing masks for the person; and surgical masks, and Class N95 respirators (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not give the micro-capillary fluids from potentially infected to fly into the air and sit on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the environment.
However, only Class N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect against the breathing of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, they only skip 5 per cent of viruses; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks together, medical personnel directly contacting patients must wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear a protective helmet with a figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing the N95 class mask; possibly the virus got into his body through his burning eyes.
Medical personnel should therefore also wear transparent facial shields or closed-type protective glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more commonly by means of mystical disinfectants, not to go out of the house by self-insulation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
An acceptable distance to the patient is considered a distance of about one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high level of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS explosion in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 did the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Uhanan calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproduction in the transfer from human to human and that the prevention of the spread and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tension, especially during the period when the whole country was prepared to celebrate China ' s New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be held within the limits of Mr. Aghan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities could adopt this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from a clinic rather than expecting official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to curb the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development and not calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective studies to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular checks and improve the response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by previously unsolicited type 2 severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) started at the end of December 2019.
Less than two months later, the disease covered China as a whole and spread to 50 countries around the world at the time of the preparation of the document.
Because the virus is very similar to the severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), a feeling of SARS relapse occurred at the outbreak of COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS with regard to the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and the level of mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Death from SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared with 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomatic, while patients with SARS usually get infected only in cases of serious illness, so prevent the spread of COVID-19 more difficult than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients may show positive samples of the virus again.
All of this greatly increases the risk of virus spread.
In the light of such rapid progress in the COVID-19 studies, some key issues remain to be addressed, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the detection of 96 per cent homologous between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like mouse kroner viruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred from flying mice.
What kind of animal has been transmitted by the virus from the original owner, such as flying mice, to man?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the route of transfer, and the epidemiological situation may worsen at any time.
Modelling at the molecular level and biochemical tests showed that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how is the virus introduced into respiratory cells and is causing subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How does the virus evolve in the process of human transmission?
Will it be the cause of the global pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS or will it periodically relapse like influenza?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoontal origin of human coronal viruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the evolution of coronal viruses (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronary viruses (HCoV) were known to cause a mild disease, such as normal cold.
The outbreaks of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronation can be.
The occurrence of a type 2 severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Central China in late 2019 has again attracted attention to the coronary virus and surprised us with high transmission, but less pronounced pathogenicity of the virus compared to the SARS-CoV family virus.
Human coronation is a zoonotic infection, and understanding of its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most human coroner viruses come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate reservoirs of certain human coronary viruses.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of coronation animals can also shed light on the pathogen of coronation in humans.
In this review, we present available data on the seven human coronation viruses, focusing on the history of their discovery and their zoonose origin and methods of inter-visual transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing various human coronal viruses from the point of view of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the present disease epidemic caused by the crown virus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions required for the successful exchange of carriers and the influence of virus evolution on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of cloud viruses with one positive and polar network of RNAs.
These viruses, which are the largest of the RNA-containing viruses with a gene of between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which reminds the crown when it is examined under an electronic microscope.
From the point of view of the structure, coronal viruses contain unsegmented genes with the same organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large open partially overcrowded accounting frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to polyproteins of replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open limits for structured proteins, including shear protein (S), cloud protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronary viruses also coded a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Based on the differences in the protein sequences,\ crown viruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and delta-coronal viruses), including most of the human coronation viruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that most alpha- and beta-kronaviruses are flying mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-kronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronary viruses have been constantly overcoming interspecies, and some of them have evolved into pathogens.
To this day, seven human coronation viruses are known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe severe respiratory syndrome type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronation viruses HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of mild forms such as cold and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike these, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, cause severe infections of low respiratory tract infections in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory disease (ODP) and extreme symptoms.
The first human coronavirus HCV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients who had been refrigerated in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have provided more detailed information on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses that cause local infections.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that the human coronation virus was generally considered harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, with the disease being sporadicly spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronation virus (2019-nCoV) found in 2019, which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19), which was introduced by more than 3,120 lives as at 3 March 2020 and the number of people infected exceeded 91,000.
An alarming signal was received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human kroner viruses are of zoonotic origin and are sourced by flying mice, mice or domestic animals.
Many data sets demonstrate, in favour of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronal viruses from flying mice, to which viruses have adapted well and have no pathogens, but demonstrate a wide range of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world with serious medical, scientific, social and moral challenges.
A study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronation viruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the forces of their evolution and the factors that limit inter-vegetative transmission.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the zoonotic origin, intervidual transmission and pathogens of human coronal viruses.
In particular, we mark and consider the following general feature: the baseline viruses from which human crown viruses have occurred are not usually pathogens for their reservoirs, but are pathogens after intervising the new carrier.
We are also analysing the trend in the evolution of human coronal viruses, which often entails a weakening of pathogens.
In the same context, the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also being considered.
Animal viruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCV-229E was first obtained from a sample of patients with cold disease, different coronal viruses were found in various infected animals, including the Indians, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human crown viruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the detection of human coronal viruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from respiratory pathways of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract failure in 1966; the virus was then adapted to reproduction in the WI-38 leguminous cells.
Patients infected with HCV-229E experienced cold symptoms, including major pain, cough, general malaise and throat pain, with high temperature and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was isolated from the organic culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of the mouse.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E infection, whose symptoms are not different from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
Both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 virus are common in the world and are usually transmitted in the winter at moderate latitudes.
The main incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week and is followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the study in volunteers, common colds were developed in healthy people infected with HCV-229E.
Only a few patients with weak immunity had severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as “the epidemic of atypical pneumonia”, was the first in all human history to be the well-documented pandemic caused by human coronation, and the cause of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, a third of the human coronation virus detected.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdun, China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread in many countries and continents.
It was estimated that about two more people could be infected by each patient; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days and the viral load peak was 10 days.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headache, high temperature, general malaise and dizziness, and later symptoms included detection, cough and respiratory failure.
Widespread laboratory deviations from the SARS standard include lymphopause, liver failure and increased creatinine.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients subsequently require intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to lower respiratory tract, other organs, including gastrointestinal tract organs, liver and thighs, which are usually accompanied by cytokine storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was excreted from an open biopsy of a mild relative who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronary viruses.
At the end of 2004, HCV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
It was initially found that it was mainly affecting children of younger age, elderly people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCV-NL63, there are symptoms such as dizziness, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study describes the release of the same virus from the nasal material taken by an 8-month-old male from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but it actually spread everywhere.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases and the peaks of their disease are due to early summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is linked to an obstructive larynx, which is also called a dome.
HCoV-HKU1 was awarded in Hong Kong in the same year by a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to insomnia and bronchiolitis, HCV-HKU1 are associated with aggravation of asthma.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 virus, which causes respiratory diseases in mild form, have been detected worldwide.
All four human coronary infections caused by invulnerable infections have been well adapted to people, and their mutations, resulting in highly pathogenic diseases, are usually unlikely, although their causes were unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent HCV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of low respiratory pathways in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively transmit and maintain human beings, these human coronal viruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first awarded in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and initial insufficiency.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases took place in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, traffic accidents and outbreaks of episodic secondary infections were recorded in close contact.
Another second blow with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) remind of symptoms of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed severe initial insufficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from the other diseases caused by human transmissible coronary viruses.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of high-death respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (34.4%) have been registered, and the MERS-CoV is therefore considered one of the most known deadly viruses.
From mid to the end of December 2019 in Uhana Province of China, Hubei was diagnosed with pneumonia, which is now linked to the infection caused by severe type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of low respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global public health emergency and that the disease itself had received the name “Kronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, with mortality of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in the province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent outside China.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS, causes severe respiratory infection, characterized by fever, cough and swelling.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to rapidly get into a severe respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but has greater ability to transfer than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of unsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, which shows the ability of this virus to spread rapidly worldwide.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronal viruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, coronation virus transmissions have a similar incubation period and the duration of the fluctuations caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the rest of the six human coronary viruses.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronary viruses causing infective infections (e.g. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to the fact that human coronal viruses that cause infective infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms, are the most common.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly below.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transfer also notes the interesting features of both human coronal viruses that cause infective infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronal viruses that cause infective infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with each subsequent virus transition (i.e. infection of each person) is reduced, as in the case of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronal viruses that cause infective infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the specimens of cola.
We still have to answer the question of whether the faecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as important (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by human coronal viruses that cause infective infections, is also of particular interest.
However, the future development of the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenity and sustainable distribution after the transition through people.
All four human coroner viruses that cause infectious infections with symptoms of mild form have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, these people may well have adapted well to these four human coronal viruses.
In other words, both those and others could be called the only survivors after the pandemics of human coronal viruses in the past.
Human coroner viruses that cause serious diseases in humans, and people with human coroner viruses that cause serious diseases just didn't survive.
In order for this to happen, human coronal viruses should be re-replicated in the human body to a sufficient extent in order to achieve adaptive mutations that are contrary to the carrier ' s restriction.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 blast will continue and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus will become fully humanized.
If it is well adapted, its transmission to people will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other control activities of infectious diseases.
For many years, four infective coronary viruses have been circulating among the population, which are common to people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
Highly qualified SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV viruses have not been adapted to man well enough, and their transfer to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to keep and reproduce in their zoonose reservoirs and seek access to acceptable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or enhancers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four infective HCV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted, at least at present, as insomniac HCV.
But he's more pathogen than inflexible HCV and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERCS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to man and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV viruses, we will find it helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, enhancer and reservoir carriers of HCV viruses.
The animal serves as the evolutionary carrier of the HCoV if it carries the birthplace with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The previous virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenized in this carrier.
Similarly, the carrier-reservator carries HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCV or its parental virus.
Unlike that, if HCV was only taken into the intermediate carrier directly before or about the time it was taken to man, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogen.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play an amplifying carrier by allowing the virus to be replicated in a molyno manner and then transmitted to humans by increasing the level of human infection.
HCoV may carry a topical infection if it is unable to withstand transfer within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that a zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (i.e.).
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV is higher than that of the population as a whole.
The Somali civts (Paguma larva) and the uni-visible dog in live animal markets became the first established carriers of similar and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was explicitly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all habitats in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that, in most cases, it was not determined in the case of gimalayas civilians living in the wild or on farms that did not fall on the market, which led to the conclusion that gimalayas had been able to serve only as an intermediate enhancer rather than a natural reservoir of SARS-COV.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of the various animals on the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded that intermediate enhancers can also serve many small dairy species.
They all seem to be the deadliest carriers of SARS-CoV.
Following the search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV, a nearby flying coV was identified as the atypical pneumonia associated with HKU3 (SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese flying mice.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other flying mouse coronary viruses account for between 88% and 92% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that flying mice were the carriers of new human pathogens.
Flying mice have also detected several SARS-like coronal viruses (SL-CoV), but none of them but one that represents HIV1 cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
It was shown that WIV1 obtained from the test of flying mouse faeces uses ACE2 flying mouse, jaw and human as a receptor for entering the cell.
Interestingly, snoring patients with SARS could neutralize HIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest relative of SARS-CoV in flying mice, dividing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parenting virus SARS-CoV, and flying mice are not a direct backup carrier SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis refers to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 fly mouse and the CoV-HKU5 fly mouse.
CoV-HKU4 flying mice and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4) to penetrate viruses.
The sequence of MRS-CoV-dependent RNA-polymerase is phylogenetically closer to the sequences of beta-kronaviruses found in Europe and Africa.
So far, there have been no live Mers-CoV viruses in wild mice.
The homology of the MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 flying mice is only 87%.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct reservoir carrier of the Mers-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that unicorn camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as those of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live Mers-CoV, the same virus found in humans, was derived from the naked pets of unicorn camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoir carriers.
It should also be noted that the vervains that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have had minor symptoms, but massive virus spread.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels have not only given the virus by respiratory means but also by faecal-oral means, which is also the main means of dispensing the virus in flying mice.
However, there are still issues, as many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have not been in the history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms and are likely to relate to the human transfer or transmission of unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERCS-CoV.
The Sars-CoV-2 nucleotide homology is 96.2% similar to the CoV RaTG13 flying mice assigned to the Asian subspecies Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are too large to attribute parental relationships to them.
This means flying mice could or could not be a direct spare carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronal mouse viruses are found in the future.
It is assumed that direct carriers of SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild species that are sold and killed on the ungulates of marine products that have been associated with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates the likely case of animal transfer.
A few recent studies based on metagenic sequencing concluded that a group of people at risk of the destruction of small dairy animals known as pangoline (Manis javanica) was also able to carry the parent betaquinavirus, a family strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the sequences of these new pangoline coronary genomes by 85% to 92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RatG13, with the identity of the nucleotide sequences of approximately 90 per cent.
They are classified in two lines of virus differentiation, such as SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-linked domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4 per cent amino acid sequence.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
The earlier study of pangoline patients also reported the identification of viral contaminants in light samples, which were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods of collection and manual processing were used in this study to obtain the sequence of the genome, which included about 86.3 per cent of the full-size viral genome.
It is impossible to rule out the possibility that pangoline has become one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animals.
However, due to the divergent sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-kronaviruses of the family SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from Pangolin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-kronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path SARS-CoV-2 in flying mice, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-kronavirus Pangoline, family SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the highest sequence homology across the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high level of similarity between pangoline beta-kronaviruses, family SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is for a re-combination between the pangoline beta-kronavirus, the family SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among beta-kronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV viruses, zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can occur from flying mouse crown viruses, while parental strains of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It has been reported that the ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) virus detected in a North American three-colour pendulum demonstrates a close family with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically related to another fly virus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be camels.
For the sake of clarity, the modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronary viruses is summarised in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the intervised transmission of HCV in the history.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was inter-vidually transmitted in 1890 and humans were infected with domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of the HCV-229E intervised transmission is not so clear.
Alfakronaviruses of flying mice near HCV-229E have been found.
Among them is the Alphakronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice.
First, people, not the Alps, could contact flying mice in a general environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the Alps.
Secondly, alpha-coronaviruses of flying mice, family HCV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in flying mice, while alpha-coronavirus alpaca caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaconavirus was not found in wild animals.
It is therefore not possible to rule out the possibility that the alpace received alphaquinavirus, the family HCV-229E, from humans.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of pathogen human viruses, including the virus of obesity, the Ebola virus, the Nipach virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could directly transmit HCV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while the alpha-kronaviruses of the flying mouse were able to serve a gene pulse of HCV-229E, alpace and unicorn camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit human viruses, just as in the case of MERCS-CoV.
MERCS-CoV is a fine example of inter-visual transmission from flying mice to single-winged camels and from single-winged camels to human beings.
The evolution of the Mers-CoV virus from flying mice is known for its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is evident that flying mice provide a rich pool of viral varieties for intervisual exchange of genetic fragments and intervised transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make flying mice “ideal distributors”.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus was introduced by unicorn camels decades ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which from the intermediate carrier became a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
These animals have a very easy disease and have a relatively low frequency of mutations.
His episodic transfer to a person is a coincidence, and he remains a deafening carrier of MERS-CoV, since his transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-kronaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
They may be atypical carriers of beta-kronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or delete several possibilities for the inter-vital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
First, flying mice may be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 family virus, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an ecological niche with flying mice through the imagery or the separation of these pets.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the intermediate carriers in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been found.
People are infected with the virus through the removal of coughs and the use of wild animals in food.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The study of pets and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as indicated above, the combination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third form, which contacted both flying mice and penguins.
The search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three main factors from viruses have also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high rate of mutations in the RNA.
Compared to other single-dose RNA viruses, the estimated rate of coronary mutations can be considered “moderately high” with an average rate of approximately 10-4 replacements per year in one section 2 depending on the phase of the adaptation of the coronary virus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have a corrective exisribonuclease that removes or even reduces the rate of mutation and weakness.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir exacerbates the replication of coronary viruses by inhibiting this exibonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising against SARS-CoV-2 that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronary mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if coronal viruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is shown below, which shows a higher level of adaptation to people.
Apparently, this virus has already been adapted to another carrier close to the human.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERCS-CoV, which is well adapted to unicorn camels.
Theoretically, vaccines and antivirals from SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to lose efficacy as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, a large gene of RNA in coronal viruses results in greater plasticity in the genetic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-visual co-evolution that is conducive to the emergence of new co-ronal viruses under appropriate conditions.
This contributes to the many unique open-ended frameworks and functions of proteins encoded in the direction of the 3′ end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique mechanism for selecting the matrix, coronary viruses accidentally and frequently switch the matrix during the RNA.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronary virus into the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, it is often turned over.
High-genomic full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombin and create new coronary viruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in animal coronation viruses, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mice.
Interoperability of the carrier virus with respect to transmission
In addition to the three factors listed above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier's receptor is another key factor important for inter-visual transmission.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in the event of inter-visual transmission, a recombination of SARS-CoV is provided.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV strains and civets, SARS-CoV is considered to be rapidly adapted in various carriers, especially with regard to mutations on the SSD protein.
In general, the RSD protein S of the crown virus interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier’s antibody’s response intensively picks it.
SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids, with 318th to 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) as well as its receptors for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
SARS-CoV RSD is able to identify the APF2 receptors of different animals, including mice, turtles, mice and enovised dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus in a multi-species manner.
In fact, only 6 amino-isolated residues were found in the RSD, which are different from human and cervical viral strains, 4 of which are in the receptor-linked motivation for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the herbaceous protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes can be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to man.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S segment suggests that the associated affinity of the S protein to human AFP2 could change.
Indeed, the study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this relationship is 10-20 times higher than between the AFP2 human and the S-virus SARS-CoV protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other receivers are required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCV-NL63 also connects with AFP2, but with another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetylsylic acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronal viruses in humans after the inter-visual transmission of animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of the intervised transmission of HCV is also managed by other factors of dependence and carrier limitation.
The differentiation of these proteins between humans and the natural reservoir carriers of HCVs, such as flying mice, unicorns and rodents, may be a barrier to inter-visual transmission.
For successful inter-violence transmission to HCoV viruses, the dependency factors must be absorbed and the carrier restrictions should be subject to them.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be identified and categorized.
Good results can result in an impartial full-scale screening of dependence and restraint factors for SARS-CoV-2 carriers using the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCV: back to zero
The diversity of mouse-flying coronal viruses provides broad opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, the coronation virus of flying mice is a genetic pulse for HCV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCV evolution and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-encoding genes has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.
Of the SARS-CoV accessories, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since the fluctuating mouse viruses, the SARS-CoV family, have been isolated, but they have been shown to encode ORF8 different proteins.
In strains isolated from the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide reaction characterized by SARS-CoV coronal viruses was detected.
This paragraph divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered as an adaptive mutation that accelerates the exchange of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-kronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Recombination locations were also defined in non-structural nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has undergone recombinant events between the various lines, which occurred in single-armed camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs where HCV was recombined with other animal coronation viruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to accidental changes in virus genes, which is likely to result from the release of the virus from the selected pressure, for example by the immune carrier system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full size ORF4 in a prototype strain of HCV-229E due to a two-celled reaction.
While an intact open ORF4 can be seen in mouse and camel-flight viruses related to HCV-229E, alphaquinavirus alpia demonstrates the enunucleotide induction, leading to a frame movement.
Finally, the evolution of new HCV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
In the case of avian mouse virus infection, there have been poorly reported symptoms or lack of them, which refers to the mutual adaptation between crown viruses and avian mice.
It turns out that flying mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronary viruses.
For example, failure to activate the prophylactic response in flying mice effectively reduces the pathology caused by crown viruses.
In addition, the natural activity of the cell killers in the flying mice is overcast by the inhibition of the natural cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the main class I interoperability molecule.
Furthermore, a high level of active forms of oxygen, which is provided with high metabolic activity of flying mice, can suppress the replication of the crown virus while affecting the count of exibonuclease, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when ingested into the new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of the crown virus can also evolve as a result of the combination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or properties of the protein to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that in the last twenty years three new human coronation viruses have occurred.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They're definitely being replicated without causing a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is the secret why we see the unsympathetic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivity of immune response and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the impact of light.
On the contrary, unsymptom carriers do not have an immune response to the coronation of the virus.
The same immune response strategy may have positive effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Flying mice have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking interferon type I at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should have a beneficial effect on people.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoms has been disrupted by flying mice.
Therefore, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasom with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 is a common scheme for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-kronavirus was found in flying mice, the 95 per cent nucleotide homology is equivalent to SARS-CoV, and the 96 per cent nucleotide homology is equivalent to SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that live animals and live animals carry viruses on the market, the same SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-kronaviruses have been detected, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, which says that pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that the fragments of the Pangolin beta-kronavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by a man.
The crown viruses have attracted general attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of kronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Convinced evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from flying mice and have been transmitted through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between people and civilians in markets, closing wild markets and destroying civilians could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of the various lines of beta-kronaviruses of PANgolines near-birth SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to remove PANOLINs in order to prevent the zoonose transmission of the infection from the product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through pangoline and other dairy products and how this can be done remains the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus has existed for a long time in unicorns.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and articles of shear for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop periodic outbreaks of mers, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective mers-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other measures of infection control.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can occur that cause outbreaks of the disease.
Various zoonoses are circulating around the world.
In particular, there are a wide variety of mouse-flying coronal viruses with zoonotic potential.
There is a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronary viruses, which will in the future lead to new coronary viruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans.
In order to reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between humans and animals, the culture of wildlife use in some areas of China should be excluded.
After the severe tests that have become SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories are seized.
While many flying mouse properties are beneficial for the spread of viruses, learning to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other species of wild animals.
In order to better understand the ecology of coronal viruses and their natural carriers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of dairy animals is required, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronal viruses from animals and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from the natural habitats of zoonose viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the head of the zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if flying mice have transmitted the previous SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangoline, it is interesting to see the circumstances under which flying mice and pangoline divide the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if a true intermediate carrier plays a third milking agent, it must be identified how it interacts with different species, including humans, flying mice and penguins.
Finally, since many dairy animals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a flying mouse, pangoline or any other milking agent, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be determined by their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for “suspects of disease” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief background guide on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronary infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experiences and provides reliable advice on combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduced the latest diagnostic criteria for “insured cases of disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Diagnology and therapy recommendations for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new crown virus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially designated as a coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was called “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a brief background guide and published it on the Military Medical Research website on 6 February 2020.
This publication drew great attention to itself.
Noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, there were seven issues of the paper “Diagnology and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19”, published by the National Committee on Health (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and the content of some of its provisions has changed significantly.
Recently, comments were made on our recommendations in the work prepared by Zhou, which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on already available clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this pandemic that covers the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of “Diagnology and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (test seventh version) and the results of ongoing studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (since 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis of the suspected disease, one element of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in and around the Uhana or other human settlements where cases of COVID-19 disease have been recorded for 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high-temperature or respiratory symptoms from the Uhana and its districts or other human settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high-temperature or respiratory symptoms from the Uchana or other human settlements, such as non-respectoritise, or non-respectorials.
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced by a reduced number of lymphocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed disease case should be based on the suspicion of a disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence points: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full sequence of the virus shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronary viruses; (3) the positive serotest results for the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody; or the change in the test result from the positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody IgG specific to the IgG antibody, or the increase of titres at least 4 times in the recovery phase for the relevant acute phase indicator.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) issue of the document, a real-time PCR test was added to the test for nucleic acid in respiratory pathways or blood tests.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) issues, and then in the seventh issue the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers who are looking for the optimal set of nucleic acid to detect early diagnosis, as well as on the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including the selection of blood samples, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criterion.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients with no known symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in the work of Xhou (Zhou) etc. should be updated, since it classified persons with no clinical symptoms as a “low risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “sudden cases of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and follow closely the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner with a view to providing effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports on five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 - a daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were recorded, as well as 33 patients who were cured at home.
All 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, told us that four men and one woman had become victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, the two who were over 60 years of age, two from 51 to 60 years of age, and one from 41 to 50 years of age.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer informed the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Syfur Rahman, Director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti Maitri Clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video statement by the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Bangladesh Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be stopped for longer than originally planned before the next Saturday.
Public transport has been stopped since 26 March and should be resumed on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first-time products — drugs, fuel and food products — has still been authorised.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March for two persons who returned from Italy and for one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people have already flourished.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeded the millions of cases of infection worldwide
According to John Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronal virus infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people died from the coronation virus COVID-19.
It occurred on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of coronal virus death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of a few countries in which there were no cases of coronary infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 C.E. (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronary infection were reported, of which at least 5,900 had a fatal outcome.
CBS News, referring to data from John Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have declared that measures to prevent the spread of the disease have been tightened.
On Thursday, Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobianin extended the regime of self-insulation of the city ' s citizens until 1 May.
Former President Vladimir Putin said that Russians throughout the country, despite self-insulation, would receive salary by 30 April.
Parliament voted to extend the emergency for 15 days; results of the vote: 215 votes for, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended command time in sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while only 3 hours earlier command time lasted from 3 to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a command clock from 10 o'clock in the evening until 4 o'clock in the morning.
The Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Dewain, announced that the regime of domestic self-insulation in the state was extended until 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian stores of Woolworths and Coles have reduced the number of toilet paper packages, which can be purchased once in all of the country ' s stores, up to two and one packages respectively.
ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package on Monday.
These restrictions were reported in cash announcements as well as on the Facebook web page.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make emergency reservations because of the assurance that COVID-19 may involve the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
In the middle of the Woolworths network, the quantity of toilet paper purchased was also limited to one package.
Previously, 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Coles trading network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the introduction of a restriction on four packages “in many stores the toilet paper is still bought too fast – one delivery per hour”, and called such a demand “unprecedented”, while the ALDI in the Facebook post published on Tuesday called the “unprecedented” trend.
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco store in Canberra also limited the number of packages last week.
In order to meet the deficit, Coles started ordering larger lots from suppliers and increased supply frequency, Woolworths ordered additional lots, while ALDI made stocks for a special share of early sale in the environment.
Russell Cimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Rideliers Association, reported that the Rideliers were trying to fill up the stocks, but this was difficult due to the restrictions of local authorities on the timetable for the journey of trucks.
It expects to increase the cost of the product, as suppliers are trying to meet the demand, but less and less profitable proposals are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the depletion of stocks, some shops could not operate in the environment.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on retail trade at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a heavy goods item, so the quantity of storage stocks was low, and after all the sale of the goods, the long series of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if there was a fillable pool, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn’t get so panicked,” says Russell Cimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the revised toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, reported on the closure of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper manufacturer, also producing Sorbent brands, reported that they are working round-the-clock to ensure a sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the lack of buyers on the Sunday of the Workday, some real estate vendors began offering the first participants free toilet paper.
The fourth edition of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and use as a toilet paper.
According to the report of ABC Australia of 3 March, shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of goods purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Cimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, disinfectants for hands, gallantries, hand washing and pain.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was noted on Sunday evening that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of the toilet paper Andres two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemics” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments of the countries need to take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are involved in the detection, testing, treatment, isolation of the sick, the detection of the occurrence of the disease and the mobilization of their citizens," explained WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and the severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friden, former director of the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
In his interview with CNN in February, he said that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from the time of its emergence to continuous global proliferation”.
Mr. Gabrielus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never observed the pandemic caused by the crown virus.
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of this emergency in the field of public health, which is of international importance, and then granted it a new status — the pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fachi, responded by saying: “This is just the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press on Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and more than 4,600 people have died.
The pandemic of coronary disease 2019-2020 is currently a pandemic of coronary disease 2019 (CVID-19) caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhana, China, in December 2019 and an emergency situation of international public health importance was announced on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were recorded in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between first and peak symptoms is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment has been found at present.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing, keeping distance between people, detecting and securing self-insulation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, command hours, workplace risk control and closures.
Pandemia has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as the widespread lack of goods exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world ' s students.
The Internet began to spread the disinformation of the virus, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who recalled them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the spread of the virus were noted.
The reduction in the number of travel and closures of heavy industry has led to a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Uhan (the capital of the province of Hubei), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia for an unknown reason and the situation was investigated in early January 2020.
Cases of infection were mainly related to the common market for Juanan marine products, which is why the virus appears to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus caused by the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recent open virus that has a great similarity to mouse-flight coronal viruses, pangoline coronal viruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were relevant to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of Morning Post, which was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had decreased, but that there had been an unexpected increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new cases of infection outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly reduced, in particular due to the number of cases with poorly pronounced symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively small cases of infection were reported among young people, with patients under 19 years of age and younger, with less than 2.4% worldwide. The United Kingdom ' s Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallans estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been checked for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country was able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy was adopted that did not require testing in cases of minor symptoms.
The study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of cases of COVID-19 infection were not detected in China until 23 January and that such unregistered disease was a source of infection for 79 per cent of registered cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
The initial baseline reproductive number (R0) estimates for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention provides that this figure may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well-treated.
In other, more complex cases, the period from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
As of 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths occurred in China over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were associated with diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include information on the deaths of patients with positive results of the COVID test performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested, such as in the case of death at home, in the homes of elderly people, etc.
The incomplete data on Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID levels 4-5 times.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Press Secretary recognizes: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is below the actual level”. His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States. Such incomplete data are often encountered in pandemics, such as the H1N1 influenza epidemic 2009; the first confirmed death was registered in Uganda on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was registered in the Philippines on 1 February and outside Asia on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than ten deaths had been reported abroad: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctica, reported death cases; several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of spread of the disease; they also affect the levels of testing, the quality of health systems using treatment schemes, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and general health status.
According to statistics at Johns Hopkins University, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality rate for the disease decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the percentage of disease mortality (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients dying from the disease and the percentage of death from the infection (IFR) that reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients dying from the disease.
These statistics do not relate to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators by specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford Medical Evidence Centre, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic ranges from 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the test on CFR evaluation.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact length of the flash are not defined and may vary depending on the location.
Mother Bonnie, a member of the University of Pennsylvania State, claims that “uncontrolled infection outbreaks usually go out of their way and then when the number of available carriers is over, they start to quit.
However, in the current situation, it is virtually impossible to make a reasonable estimate of when this will happen.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Jung Nanishan, argues that “all can end by June”, if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will probably circulate within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the direction of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is established (maybe 18 months or more)”, compliance with physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don’t think this crown virus will ever disappear at all because it is so easily transmitted,” and that it “may become a seasonal disease, rising every year”.
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may carry disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetting in the respiratory tract (spleen), swelling, swelling, itching, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, swelling, redness, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems about every six persons.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDCs) list emergency symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, constant pain or chest tightness, sudden feeling of unconsciousness, difficulty in awakening and bruising of the person or mouth. If these symptoms occur, medical attention should be sought immediately. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, sepsis and death.
Some infected people may experience disease without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the analysis confirm the fact of the infection, so doctors recommend that individuals in close contact with patients diagnosed with a diagnosis be placed under strict control and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptomatic fluxes varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it usually ranges from five days; there is no full clarity on the symptoms of discolouration: the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is considered that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small droplets in the air with cough, cough or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some open-cast studies, droplets can range from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets emitted into the air during the conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods. Respiratory drops can also be formed during breathing, including during the conversation, although the virus is usually not transported by air.
The drops can fall into the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into the easy.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular rehabilitation, can lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if it concerns the contaminated surface, including the skin, with subsequent touch to its eyes, nose or lips.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of faecal and oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is the most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before the onset of symptoms and later stages of the disease.
There were cases when tests were positive for three days prior to the onset of symptoms, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus before an express symptoms occur.
There are only a few reports of laboratory confirmed cases of unsymptom disease, but some countries have also found cases of transmission of disease from unsymptom carriers.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that until it is quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) the virus is capable of living up to three days, on cardboard surface — within one day, and on mild surfaces — up to 4 hours.
However, these data vary depending on the humidity and temperature, and positive results were obtained from domestic and other animals on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as after contact with other surfaces where infected people could be affected.
A severe severe respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first found in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group registered in Uhana.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are naturally found in family coronation viruses. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed by means of a home soap that dissolves its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV virus.
He's supposed to have a zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronary virus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, subtype Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of flying mouse viruses.
At the overall and genomic level, it is 96 per cent identical to other samples of mouse coronation virus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the sequences of pangoline and human viruses.
The overall genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest rate of similarity (92%) is between the pangoline coronal virus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangoline is intermediate masters of the virus.
Virus infection may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by analysis of the polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secretor or computer tomography.
The results of the study comparing the PCR and the CTC methods used in Uganda showed that the CTC was much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease flow processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use KT for boxing or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnostics”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymeric chain reaction test (RT-PCR) is being conducted.
It can be carried out on breath samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to a few days.
A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them proved to be accurate enough to obtain universal approval.
In the U.S., the cellex serological test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of X-ray symptoms and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral disturbances of the type of matte glass and the absence of pleural discharges.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for setting up an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of similar infections, such as adenvirus, with the identification of COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests, there is limited clinical specification.
A large study was conducted in China comparing the results of the CT of the breast cell and the PCR testing, and it was found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted more quickly; they were also more sensitive and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a boxing tool in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus through X-rays and computer tomography, vertical neural networks were developed based on artificial intelligence.
Prevention strategies include maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth dirty hands, use in coughing or chewing soaps, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated from people, many Governments recommend refraining from any short-term visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and limiting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus could spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread to people, some of whom do not know where or how they have been infected. Medical workers who are infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and eye protection. The tracking of contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens by their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring this kind of monitoring for people.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on the development of personal data-confidential solutions, such as the user ' s proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user is in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he or she will receive an appropriate notification. There are also baseless versions of how to prevent infection, such as nose and mouth damage, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no vaccine from COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or after severe hand pollution, as well as before a meal, after smearing, coughing or chewing.
This is necessary because, while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap that conceals its protective coating.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat alcohol-based hands with at least 60% alcohol content.
WHO recommends avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (the stainless steel disinfectant begins to operate one minute after application) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrochloric acid and 0.2-7.5% iodine.
Other components, such as benzene chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an establishment, such as an office or a daily station, all spaces of such premises, including office, toilets, general facilities, electronic equipment, such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose of the back of the bow or the towel and immediately removing the hygienic items used.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks, since the use of masks may limit the volume and range of releases that are spread in the air when talking, chewing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virusologist at the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching a person with dirty hands is the main way of infection.” The masks are also recommended for the use of those who treat people who can be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for persons who are pursuing a man with a COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask actually reduces the number of contactes.
Several countries have begun calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC Centres, U.S.A., recommend wearing tissue facial masks for non-medical purposes. China has separately stressed the importance of using single-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or human places.
Health officials in Thailand call on people to prepare and remove facial tissue masks in domestic settings.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the streets without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to product stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are made by mid-March, all passengers on trains and in-city buses were ordered to use medical masks.
In Panama, residents are obliged to wear a medical mask out of the street; those who cannot buy masks have been advised to wear them on their own in domestic conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social remoteness (also known as physical remoteness) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimising close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding human places, using contactless greetings and physically away from others.
Many Governments of the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social distance.
The maximum number of people who could be collected in one place, according to the recommendation of the United States Government and health organizations, was rapidly reduced from 250 people (in regions where no COVID-19 was available), up to 50 persons and later up to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the gathering of more than two persons into groups: elderly people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and weakened immune system are facing an increased risk of serious virus disease; CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if the outbreak occurs in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus clarifying the objective of this measure, reducing physical contact in the context of social relationships, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to full social isolation rather than remain in contact with other people in alternative ways; some agencies had published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among others, it has been recommended that you only have sex with your permanent partners with whom you live, and that you be assured that you do not have a virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended to self-insulation at home.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas should be placed on quarantine.
The most severe quarantine was prescribed for persons in high-risk groups.
Persons who may have contacted the infected COVID-19 or recently visited the country or region affected by the epidemic have been recommended to find quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
The strategies for combating the outbreak include curbing the spread of the disease, suppressing it or mitigating it.
The prevention of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as other measures of infection control and vaccination in order to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to reduce the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health and society system.
Measures to curb and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken at the same time.
The suppression of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to levels below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infection is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the eradication of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical remoteness, such as closing schools and eliminating mass activities; the community's involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
Mass screenings and localized quarantines were introduced in South Korea, as well as a system of alerting the movements of infected persons.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to those infected with self-insulation and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and fines for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines has been increased; the modeling of Britain and the United States has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (a slowdown but not a halt to the spread of the epidemic) and depression (a halt to the growth of the epidemic).
The optimal policy to mitigate the spread of the disease can reduce peak health burden by 2/3 and mortality by two, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be a preferred method, but it must be used until the virus is circulating among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are currently no antivirals approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking prescriptionless medicines from the cold, drinking sufficient fluid and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, internal fluidization and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic” means could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main measure of response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Bureau of the World Health Organization issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to assist in the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the abolition of early procedures, where possible, the identification of virus and isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as the enhancement of intensive therapy by training staff and increasing the number of available IHIs and chickens.
There are different theories about where the first case of infection could occur — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new coronary infection occurred on 1 December 2019 in the city of Uhan Province of Hubei, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronary infection in the province of Hubei increased gradually.
They were mainly related to the opt-in market of Juanan marine products, on which live animals were also sold, and one of the theories was that the virus penetrated into the human organism from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, the Hubei clinic was registered with a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin, with which Dr. Zhang Tianzinj was working, reporting the case to the Center for Control and Prevention of Xianhan ' s Disease in the city of Uhanan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the Uhan City Central Clinic warned their colleagues about “Kronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, were warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ay Fen, received an apology from his superiors for panicking.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uganda published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The Ugandan health authorities reported the number of unknown pneumonia cases, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, which was promoted by Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan was a transport and main railway unit.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people who were infected in Beijing and one in Schengen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, there were 6,174 people who had been infected by the United States, as at 26 March, with the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had been reported worldwide.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one registered infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted their free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to prevent the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory residence, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as a time of command. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form quarantine, more than 50 million people were in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion people were in India.
On 26 March 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and in two days the figure increased to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhana on 1 December 2019; according to the second report, whose information was not verified, that date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Zizian was working with the case of an unknown type of pneumonia, which was reported by the Center for the Control and Prevention of Xianhan Disease in the city of Uhan on 27 December.
The initial genetic testing of patients on 27 December 2019 showed the presence of SARS-like coronary virus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uganda issued an appropriate public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Uhan about the responsibility for “supply spreading”.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to be transmitted from human to human.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party C. Zinpin by the “national war”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in the history of humanity” began to unfold on 23 January, and the Sanitary Border and the Prohibition of Entry into the Uhana and Back were declared, and later the measure spread to 15 cities in the province of Hubbay and affected about 57 million people in total.
The use of personal transport was prohibited in the city.
Celebrations were canceled in many places on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January).
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Hošenšan, which was completed within 10 days.
A second hospital, Laishenchan, was subsequently built, which had received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built Chinese hospitals, China has also re-processed 14 other institutions in Uganda, such as conference centres and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government has taken additional measures to stop the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year ' s celebration.
Universities and schools were closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions, the Chinese authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in the Province of Hubei and beyond.
The timetable for public transport has been changed and the museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) had faced some form of restrictions on open air movement, and after a global outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the import of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city. As of 23 March, only one case of transmission of infection within the country that occurred five days before, in this case, from a person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul, was registered.
On 24 March 2020, China ' s Prime Minister Lee Ketchen reported that the spread of domesticly transmitted diseases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been monitored.
On the same day the travel restrictions in Hubbay, other than Uhanya, were removed, two months after the quarantine province was closed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or type of residence would be suspended from 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for a visa in Chinese Embassy or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume their work and to provide companies with a package of money-stimulation measures. On 4 April at 10:00 a three-minute “minute silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning over the victims of the crown virus declared by the State Council and the party of Quinmin, but the central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online while respecting physical distance to avoid the recurrence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea on 20 January 2020.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, which occurred in many cases because of the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchhonji.
Shinchhungji followers arrived in Tagu from Uhana, which is probably a source of excitement.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection have been registered in Korea on 28 February and this rate has increased to 3,150 by 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after the three soldiers had confirmed the presence of the virus.
As a result, the flight schedule has changed, and South Korea has launched a programme on the protection of the population against the presence of the virus, the monitoring of contacts and the organization of quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best organization in the world.
Boxing methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through mobile application to all those who came from abroad, head virus testing that had been prepared for the next day, as well as increased testing opportunities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that the entire city was not isolated.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either commended the President ' s actions or called upon Mr. Muna to give an impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had recorded the lowest total number of infections per day for four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as of 1 April, all newly arrived from the border would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to the media, on 1 April, South Korea sought assistance in the testing of 121 countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kum, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people were killed later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting activities, Friday prayers and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion reilions to combat the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani said on 26 February 2020 that the Government was not planning to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
In March, plans to limit interurban travel were announced, but the intensive movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
The Shiite shrines in Kuma remained open to palm trees until 16 March 2020. Iran became the centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the light of the allegations of concealment of outbreaks in Iran, by 28 February more than ten countries linked the outbreaks to Iran, indicating that outbreaks there may be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, proved positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (“The Watch of Human Rights”) called upon the Iranian prison management to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for a peaceful inconsistencies, as well as temporary release of all prisoners belonging to this category.
The Organization claims that there is an increased risk of virus spread in closed institutions, such as prisons where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths during one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from this disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronary disease were recorded every hour in Iran and one new death from the coronary disease every ten minutes.
According to the WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also expected that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for a reduction in economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had hit the territory of Italy when two Chinese tourists tested the SARS-CoV-2 tested in Rome.
The number of cases of infection has grown rapidly, causing the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and declare an emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was subsequently found, beginning with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on the banning of outbreaks, whereby more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Enter the area of outbreaks and exits will be closed.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered all schools and universities throughout the country to stop business and to cancel sports activities." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered that all schools and universities be closed, as 100 people had already been registered in Italy.

As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronary infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that such a high level of mortality in Italy can contribute to the combination of two factors: a large number of elderly people in that country and the lack of access to all those who are now more than the crown virus.
The United Kingdom has responded to this virus most peacefully from all the affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending refraining from all visits and social contacts that are not of prime importance, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised workers to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than 2,500 pounds of sterling per month as a means of supporting the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures on social distance, prohibiting more than two persons from gathering together and limiting travel and active rest on fresh air only in cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced through police involvement, the introduction of fines and the disposal of people.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for enterprises that provided “lifelessness”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business stores, car parking stations and garages.

Nevertheless, the United States population was not immediately tested and the true extent of the outbreaks of the disease during that period had been hidden.
The test was hampered by the marriage of the test sets issued by the federal Government in February, by the end of February of the Federal Government ' s authorization to use non-State test sets developed by scientific organizations, companies and clinics, as well as by restrictive criteria before the beginning of March, which would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done by appointment of a medical doctor).

Some officials and investigators have criticized the dependence of the United States on imports of essential materials, including items of first necessity, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of the air travel patterns used to map and predict disease patterns.
According to information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taiwan have adopted the largest number of passengers from Uganda.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was called the least prepared for the outbreak of the disease, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared. On 7 February Australia adopted its plan of action in emergency situations related to the new crown virus (COVID-19).

On the other hand, China ' s assistance has been well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency assistance operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and prevent the spread of infection.
WHO noted the clear differences between the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, during which allegations were made to the Chinese authorities in order to conceal information that had prevented the prevention and deterrence of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the Central Government “provided regularly updated information on the situation in order to avoid panics during the New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central authorities to introduce a ban on the movement of transport in Uhana, the representative of WHO, Mr. Galea, noted that, although “this measure was certainly not recommended by WHO”, it was also “an important confirmation of the fulfilment of the obligation to stop the epidemic at the most common place” and called it “unprecedented in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability to transmit infection from human beings outside China and the increase in the number of infected countries in other countries, WHO has declared the emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation has become the sixth since 2009, when this measure was first applied during the outbreak of swine influenza.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanam, stated that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and medium-income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that are too restrictive to international movements and trade”, and that “the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO called on the world community to allocate $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the low-income epidemic, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have virus-infected systems, although the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the measure of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest call”, and urged the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease — COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Unit was established to coordinate all United Nations response measures; these steps, as WHO states, will “focus on health response, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic context”.
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint special team to provide international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation within China and to assess “the severity of the disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of provincial and district response measures, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world should do more to prepare for the possible pandemic of the crown virus, noting that “it is too early to call this pandemic, but countries should be ready to do so”.
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global spread of the crown virus would be increased from “high” to “high” – the highest degree of readiness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Emergency Health Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a verification by each Government on the planet to be ready for the real situation: it is time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready, and it has also emphasized that the right response can help the world avoid “the worst scenario of developments”.
Ryan also stated that the current data did not serve as a basis for declaring the global pandemic to official public health representatives, and added that the announcement of the pandemic would mean that “we recognize that everyone on the planet would be at risk of being infected with this virus”.
On 11 March, the WHO announced the outbreak of the pandemic crown virus.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarming high level of spread and the severity of the disease and not least the alarming level of inaction in relation to the problem”. WHO was seriously criticized for a considered inadequate approach to the concept of pandemic, including the subsequent announcement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as pandemic.
In response to the situation, Mr. Tedros Adanam, Director-General of WHO, was requested to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, ten UN experts on human rights stressed the importance of respecting the rights of each person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply to him life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not at any rate justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with limited capacities, minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, persons living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, refugees and other groups in need of State support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to familiarize itself with opinions and recommendations.
The digital database contains information on country policy trackers on strengthening health and global economy systems, eliminating the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions in order to help countries learn from each other and to promote coordinated global response to the fight against the crown virus.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Goova and Eduardo Bolsonara, the son of President of Brazil Jaira Bolsonara, for the action taken to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubbay.
A number of heads of the Chinese Communist Party (KPC) level of provinces were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these dismissals were evidenced by the dissatisfaction of the political establishment in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party of China from public wrath over the outbreak of the crown virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lizjan, expressed disagreement with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the crown virus had begun in Uhan, but took sides with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had emerged in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Presidential Administration Donald Trampa called the crown virus “Chinese virus” or “Uhana virus”, stating that “Censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement in turn has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “deprives the US President’s administration of preventing the spread of the disease”.
The Daily Beast has had access to the US Government telegram, which contains communication strategic smartness, apparently thought by the National Security Council, with the following references to the strategy: “It is all in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations." Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a “propaganda effort” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the fight against peer influence and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is insisting on promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information being sent to assist the last two countries.
The donation by Jack Ma of Cuba ' s 100,000 medical masks was prohibited under United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The US authorities are also accused of redirecting assistance to other countries in their own country.
With regard to medical masks, disputes also arose between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of HICPs for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support from the European Union for the Italian crown virus.
Mauricio Massari, the Italian ambassador to the EU, said that “China has only reacted bilaterally.
This clearly does not show European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a mission to Italy of Russian military sanitaries, specialized disinfection and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or not useful for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of trying to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President Attilio Fontana, President of Lombardy, and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Press Secretary Kremlin Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production rates, they will also be able to respond if necessary”.
NATO's Defence 2020 military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO military exercises after the end of the Cold War, will be carried out in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defender 2020 (Protector-2020): “In the crisis that has occurred today in the field of public health, these exercises pose a threat to the lives of not only the US and many European participating countries, but also the people of the countries where such activities are to be carried out”. The Government of Iran was severely affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament being infected, as well as fifteen other political or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, President of Iran, Hassan Ruhani, in an open letter, addressed world leaders with a request for assistance, saying that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets in connection with sanctions imposed against Iran by the United States. The epidemic called for the United States to adopt social policies common to other states, including the establishment of a single health and care system for children paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on the prospects of Donald Trump for re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and that the pandemic had aggravated the diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticised Japan ' s “distinct and passive quarantine measures” after Japan has announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine site specifically designated by the Government.
South Korean society was initially divided by the reaction of President Mun Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Muna to give the impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the unlimited right to rule by order, to suspend Parliament's work, to hold elections and to punish those who would be charged with spreading faecal information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of the crown virus was referred to as the cause of several cases of a lack of supplies due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the accumulation of goods in panic and the collapse of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration of Food and Drug Quality Control has issued warnings about lack of medication and medical equipment, resulting in increased consumer demand and failure of suppliers.
In several human settlements, panic shopping also took place; this resulted in the disappearance of first-needed goods, such as food products, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry is warning of delays in electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General, Mr. Tedros Adanam, the demand for individual protection has increased 100 times.
This jump led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
He also called for a lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that health workers would be hit for this reason.
In Australia, buyers of the Daigou system had been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
This has resulted in a lack of child nutrition in some supermarkets and has subsequently been banned by the Government of Australia. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as high demand for food, there has been a sharp lack of food in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products that have proved to be successful have made it possible to avoid the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with small agricultural production, did not experience significant declines, but, in the view of industry, prices for agricultural production could increase.
The food stores remained vacant only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks to ensure that the population was fully fed.
Similar laws exist in Italy which require food producers to maintain food stocks in case of emergencies.
The injury suffered by the world economy has affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by measures to combat the spread of the virus adopted by the Government, resulting in a 20.5 per cent decrease in retail sales.
Maternal China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, it is considered that the outbreak of the virus poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
As predicted by Agate Demarai, an Economist Intelligence Unit, the volatility in the markets will continue until a clearer understanding of the potential results is available.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could exceed the impact of the atypical pneumonia epidemic from 2002 to 2004.
According to one of the estimates made by an expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion and the negative impact could be up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporters (OECD) has begun to take “preliminary measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to China's fall in demand.
World fund markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concerns about the outbreak of the crown virus, various United States fund indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Doo-Johns Index for Industrial Companies, showed the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Doo index falling at 1191 points, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than 10 percent decline.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
The shares fell again because of concerns about the spread of the crown virus, and the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of economic recession.
Economist Mohammed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond more quickly than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors with regard to the prohibitions on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist landmarks, and the recommendations of Governments not to make any travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp drop in flight demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British Flybe regional airline ceased to exist.
A negative influence on the cross-line industry has proved to be as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ports of ferry were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Qah-jun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have abolished a number of activities involving a large number of people, including annual new festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many new-year activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed in order to prevent mass accumulations of people; for example, the Forbidden City has been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new year ' s cannicles until 10 February, which indicated that most enterprises would not open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and announced an emergency, closing schools by March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The retail sector has been affected globally: the hours of shops have been reduced, and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retail businesses in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by between 50 and 60 per cent.
As a result, the attendance of shopping centres fell by 33 to 43 per cent in March compared with February.
Operators of shopping centres around the world have introduced additional measures such as improving health conditions, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and canceling activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave 14-22 million people behind the poverty line than it would have been in a similar situation but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, around 5 million people lost their jobs in China during the Uhan epidemic.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers were at home in their country's provinces or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for help.
According to the Estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the outbreak of the crown virus in the United States may leave 47 million people at work and the unemployment rate may reach 32 per cent. Self-insulation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers working on a daily basis. The study conducted by the Angus Reida Institute has shown that 44 per cent of Canadian households have faced unemployment in some way. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since the introduction of severe isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Nearly half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to a Government-subsidized reduced working day.
The German wage scheme for part-time work was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially established or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society by ensuring the safety of their staff and the public as well as, if possible, by supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed for an indefinite period, or had access to them been limited to a different extent and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or transferred to other dates.
Efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and yet another recent and ongoing follow-up to the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Easter Week in Rome, which is held in the last week of the Christian repentant period — the Great Post.
Many Epaphroditus recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend the services on the morning; in some churches, church services began to broadcast on radio, in direct air, or on television, while some church leaders suggest that public service be conducted.
The Roman Catholic Church of Rome closed to visit its churches, temples and St. Peter’s Square, where Christian palaces are no longer present, and later other religious organizations also abolished the worship and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and temples.
Iran ' s Ministry of Health announced the abolition of Friday ' s prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the crown virus, and later the temples were closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign settlers and their own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
Pandemia has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or transferred, including the UEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak of the crown virus also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics to begin at the end of July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transferred to the period after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021”. Casinos and other gambling institutions around the world were closed and poker tournaments normally broadcast in direct air were also transferred or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players going online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered because different music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as the Broadway, also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians began to explore the options for continuing their activities and sharing their results online, organizing direct broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helped people in creative professions to continue to perform, publish or publish their products.
The network has a number of online memes on the subject of the crown virus, many of which are humourous and complicate alarming moods for periods of uncertainty.
Since the appearance of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese and East Asian citizens, as well as against the people of the hot spots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February briefings (when most cases of infection were still limited by China) included racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who claimed to have earned the virus or received a fair reward for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese attitudes have also been seen.
Many of the inhabitants of Uganda and Cuba reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as its residents living in the affected areas, were supported both in offline and online mode.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe in the face of a serious outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions could also begin to feel suspicious and xenophobic; and the citizens of such countries, such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, had signed an early petition to prevent Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to prevent the epidemic.
In Japan, Hajiteg #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDontComeToJapan) took leading positions on Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report an increase in racist attitudes and even attacks.
President of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for calling the crown virus “Chinese virus”; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesting attacks on buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uganda.
Students arriving from the border with China in north-east India and studying in large cities in India reported cases of the outbreak of the crown virus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatia Janata State Department, West Bengalia, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that is why God has avenged them”.
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “misleading”. In China, as a result of the pandemic, xenophobic and racism again erupted against non-Chinese citizens: foreigners were called “foreign waste” and objects to be “utilized”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have eliminated such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the crown virus.
Many scholars have made their scientific articles about the outbreak of the crown virus available to the public.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their studies on print publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronary virus 2019 (CVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 includes methods of detection of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recognises the coronary RNA.
This test is specific and is intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm enough recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control.
Anti-cancer analyses indicate the number of people who have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to contact them in the hospital or were not at all present.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing opportunities, there were no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population in any country.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data may have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
The test can be carried out using a polymeric chain reaction of real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) on breath samples obtained in different ways, including nostalgic fats or wet specimens.
The results are usually available over the period from several hours to 2 days.
OT-PCR testing carried out in throat-derived cats is only effective during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, yet it continues to multiply slightly.
In infected patients tested for the second week of the disease, materials may be taken from the lower respiratory tract using a drying catheter or may be used as an alternative.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Sharita, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymeric chain reaction with real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) and a set of 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set of SARS-CoV-2 findings based on a clinical-level PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It identifies the “E” gene, common to all beta-kronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. China’s BGI Group has become one of the first companies authorized by China’s National Drug Administration to use the emergency kit for detection of SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the PCR. In the United States, the Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in public health laboratories.
One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to the lack of reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were processed per day throughout February 2020.
The two-component tests were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and only after that date were permitted for testing by State and local laboratories.
The test was approved by the Food and Medicinal Products Review Office under an emergency authorisation. The US commercial laboratories began testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics started testing at COVID-19 across the country as of 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were declared; the collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia a COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology “VECTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of a test that can be conducted within 3.5 hours of a large sample, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency permit for Abbott laboratories to conduct Abbott m2000 tests; before FDA issued such a permit Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the U.S.A. from FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using technology for amplification of isothermal nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of fluctuating temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody, which is specifically linked to the nucleocapid protein (N-white) of the new coronary virus, and is expected to achieve results within 15-20 minutes, such as a flu test.
The review of the specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that “the chest X-rays have little diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical signs identified during the CTC include bilateral multi-story sub-pleural focusses on the type of “matric glass” with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Sub-pleural domination, the sign of the bluish bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT was much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincided with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use the CT for boxing or as a first line test method in the COVID-19 diagnostics”. As of March 2020, the original CDC recommends using the PCR method.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the preparation of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control. Analysis may be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or by on-site diagnostics (POCs)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-production automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
The CLT usually uses one specimen of peripheral blood, although serial samples can also be used to monitor the immune response.
In POC, one blood sample is usually obtained through the perforation of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for a blood clotting phase. On 26 March 2020, FDA called 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and can now pass their tests on the antibodies.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test kits, which can be detected in samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of combating the virus.
The production of the test consists of several hundred samples over several hours, and therefore this method works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of the virus RNA.
The antibody can usually be detected 14 days after the infection. At the beginning of April, Britain found that none of the kits it acquired for the antibody analysis did produce satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed to allow patients with suspected virus to stay at home: “The emergency care office personnel transfer the sample sample to the patient,” the patient spits in, returns and receives the test results for some time. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot suspect test scheme, which eliminates the risk of infection by other clinics, or the need to de-identify the patient's early care machine if it was used to transport the patient.
The expression centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures in another country. On 2 March, Germany's National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance Doctors stated that about 12,000 tests were ready to be carried out daily in ambulatory conditions, and only 10,700 tests were available a week earlier.
If the survey is designated by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koh Institute, Germany ' s overall test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, it was proposed that several large cities should be tested.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, since only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as a calendar week of 12/2020, at SARS-CoV-2, at least 483 295 analyses were taken, including at Week 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9 per cent) were positive. Researchers at the Israeli Clinic Techion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken by 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample would show a positive result.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Zyan and completed in just five days; the modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of disease in Hubee would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the Uhan laboratory, the Hoo-Jan laboratories were immediately opened in Schengen, China, China, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the total daily passing capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplicity schemes of Origami Assays were issued, which could test up to 1,22 patient analyses on COVID19 using only 93 samples. Such balanced structures could work in small laboratories, except for the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack of and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have referred to test sample processing protocols that provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the number of tests for coroner virus carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita at present exceeds the rates of any other country and that the majority of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the ability to perform an express test, along with the acquisition of Group 42 and BGI laboratories for mass testing (based on their laboratories for the detection of Huo-Yan emergencies in China).
This 14-day laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first such large-scale laboratory operating outside China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of the coronary virus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, which resulted in the lack of test kits in the United States. At the beginning of the explosion in China and the United States, there were problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits recommended by health experts.
And here in South Korea, experts say, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new crown virus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on providing testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for greater development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private U.S. laboratories, with hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded and stockpiles of feed and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC had “deficiencies” and therefore the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that interfered with private test development. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these kits were not accurate.
The company explained that the reason for the inaccuracies of the results could be a failure to collect samples or the wrong use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would respond to incorrect sets and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test sets that the Czech Republic acquired in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million of the test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic invited them to be dropped in Danube. Atesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits acquired in China had “high error” and the Ministry “did not get to use them”. Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for persons whose analyses have produced positive results on SARS-CoV-2 and monitoring of those who have been contacted by such patients have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first person died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of approximately 3400 people, with an interval of approximately ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed disease were quarantined.
Entry into the territory of the human settlements was closed, and this measure had completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine of the 2020 crown virus pandemic in Singapore, there was much less tension than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled there, and Singapore began on 28 March to urge residents to stay at home, but schools where the cannicles ended on 23 March were opened on a calendar.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also faced the pandemic through intensive contact monitoring, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine, but were less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries had been able to detect more patients with poorly-expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no mass testing resources as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 should send their first five positive and the first ten negative results of the analysis to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories to confirm the test.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next schedule, the indicators of the column ‘positive results’ depend on the country-specific test policy.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages than the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleaning hands to remove contamination, fats, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted faecally.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or normal cold, such as with unwashed hands, noses, or lips (i.e. mucous membranes).
Five critical moments during the day after which hands should be washed with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's nipples or changing the pancakes, before feeding the child, before eating, before and after preparation or processing of raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with gold. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, in time and after cooking.
Before and after treatment for a sick person.
After changing the towels or washing the child in the toilet.
After smearing, coughing or chichinia.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical care is related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases), as well as from chemicals that may prove harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing food or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronal virus and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces infant mortality in households.
The 2013 study showed that more quality washing of hands could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure is able to reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminder of the use of hand washing may reduce the number of diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is comparable to the use of low-income regions of clean water.
The reduction in diarrhoea by 48 per cent may be related to washing hands with soap; washing hands with soap is the only effective and low-value way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ODPs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each house, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the ORI, is the major cause of death among children under five years of age, which brings about 1.8 million children a year.
Of diarrhea and pneumonia, almost 3.5 million children are killed each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after a solid toilet can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention and reduce diarrhea mortality almost twice, and mortality from acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Handwashing also prevents the onset of impetuous disease, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent washing of hands is that it may lead to skin drying and, consequently, to damage it.
The Danish study in 2012 showed that too often hand washing may lead to the scarring and swelling of the skin, a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often hand washing may also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ODR).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of faecal and oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (sweet release, defecation), after washing the baby’s nipples (sweet change), before feeding the child, before food intake and before/after preparation or processing of raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of the cut or wounds, after chewing, coughing or smearing, after touching the waste of animal origin or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the hand washing procedure is relatively low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that on average 38.7% of families wash hands with soap is a common practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to the average, 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China – 23%; there are currently several methods for changing behaviour and developing hand washing in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing of hands is one of the methods used to help children learn to do this.
“A programme of emergency medical care”, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen child health and raise the level of education of children.
This national programme is based on de-registration, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fur.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if soap or detergents are added to the washing process.
The main action of soap and soap is to remove barriers to solubleity and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered to be an effective means of cleansing the skin, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic contamination, are badly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, is conducive to the treatment process.
Durable soap may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use.
A small number of studies on each cover of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid honey reveal the low probability of such infection, since the bacteria are mucous membranes of the penis.
The CPC still claims that “dried milk with a hand doctor is a preferred option for washing hands”.
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended contraceptives or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the advertising.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection products, complex compounds may contain acids (xys, ascorbic, milky) as regulators of the RN, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other repellents (aloe faith, vitamins, mantol, plant extracts). The complex analysis carried out by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in order to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the skin, simple varieties of soap were as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
Hot water is still not warm enough for human skin to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at the body temperature of 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, hot soap is more effective than cold.
In contrast to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
The disinfectant for hands (sanitizer) or an antiseptic for hands is a cure for hands with no water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand-care facilities (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol by addition of fertilizers such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) as gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or pen, which facilitate the use of these substances and reduce the effect of dehydration by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrochloric acid increases antimicrobial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95 per cent of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and influenza.
The disinfectants containing 70 per cent of alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a 3.5-decimal reduction log) in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent to 99.999 per cent of bacteria (a 4-5 reduction log) in the hands 1 minute after use. The disinfectants for the most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against the type of norvirus (or Norwalk) most frequent cause of infection gastroenteritis. A sufficient number of antiseptics or alcohol-containing agents should be used to treat and rub the skin with care on both sides.
The face and back surface of both bearings, as well as the length of space between fingers, shall be extended for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully ingested.
The fingertips on both hands should also be thoroughly washed. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the handwashing should be selected, not the use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are highly contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but should not be a substitute for the complete washing of hands if there is access to water and soap.
The frequent use of alcohol-based disinfectants may cause dryness of the skin if their composition does not contain softening agents and/or moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening substances.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing reducing components caused much less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobials.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dropper syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually absent.
The lower probability of an irritant contact dermatitis was a factor in the selection of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash their hands from organic substances but simply disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as conventional soap and water, as the use of such agents is still in hand.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for non-alcoholic hands depends to a large extent on the components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcoholic beverages.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the products used in benzolconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose efficacy after multiple use, probably due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low - income communities cannot afford milk and replace it with gold or clay.
Zola or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than honey.
One problem with this method is that if soil or soil are contaminated by microorganisms, this may, in contrast, increase the spread of the disease.
As with soap, salt is a disinfectant, since it forms a stomach solution in contact with water.
If flour is not available, it is recommended that gold or sand be used as an alternative to WHO.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Disease Control Centre recommends the use of hand washing techniques, including the following steps:
Put your hands under the hot or cold running water.
It is recommended that water flows because standing water may be contaminated and that water temperature is not relevant at all.
Help your hands expand with a large amount of soap, including the back of the laundromats, as well as areas between fingers and nails.
Mile removes the microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just one water) people are inclined to wash their hands more carefully.
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
Trina helps remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer you get the third hand, the more microbes are removed.
Carefully wash your hands under the water.
The laying of hands in standing water can cause reinfection.
Wash your hands with clean air, or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated, and the most common people are left out of such areas as thumbs, wrists, thumbs and legs.
The artificial nails and shriveled nails for nails can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wet iron be used to prevent the drying of the hands that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water and soap are not available, there are many different ways to wash your hands: pouring water out of a canister or bottle with opened openings and/or using the salt, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-saving solutions such as foot-and-mouthed cranes and other low-cost options.
Cran with a foot pedal is a simple structure made up of an embellishment hung on a rope and a foot rind that should be pressed to pour water into the hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
The effective drying of hands is an integral part of the hygiene process, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper bearings are much more hygienic than electric dryers for the hands that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Symposium for the Production of Paper Solips and Sewings; this study compared the level of hygiene of paper sewings, hand-held dry air and more modern hand-held flow air dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in hot air, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased on average by 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the faucets.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in the airflow, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent in the laundromats.
After washing and dry hands, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips is reduced to 76 per cent on average and in the laundries to 77 per cent. Researchers have also tested to determine the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors in the toilet and the toilet environment in each type of dry area.
The air dryer, which emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), is capable of sinking micro-organisms from the hands and from its own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet and sanouslium within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hot-air hand dryers spreads micro-organisms within a radius of up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of drying hands.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the dry-handed method:
There are many different producers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper pens.
Cleaning hands with disinfectants may be an alternative in the absence of soap and water during travel.
The disinfectant for alcohol-based hands shall contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemmelweis found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in the prevention of disease in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices is indeed helping to reduce the level of infection.
The handwashing takes at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hand.
The hands should be carefully separated by shaking their fingers.
If there's a scratch under your feet, you can use the damage to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water on their hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and waste them with clean air.
After drying hands, closing the skull and, where necessary, closing and opening any door, use paper box.
This prevents the repeated contamination of hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in medical facilities is to remove and prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms (microbials).
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands regularly before contacting patients and thus spread microorganisms.
As a result of one study, correct washing of hands and other basic procedures may reduce the level of catheter-related bleeding infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a standard washing and handling of hands, which should be used in the health sector.
The WHO manual on hygiene is also available on its website and open for public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in co-authority.
If compliance with the regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and check the hygiene.
The World Health Organization represents “five times” when hands are washed:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
prior to use of antiseptics, as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap by washing hands (medicine or antimicrobial soap) helps destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in the environment with high levels of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To “clean up” hands before surgery, a tap is required that can be included and excluded, without affecting its hands; a little chlorohexidine or iodine should also be used to wash hands, sterile hands to dry after washing, sterile towel and other sterile tool for cleaning under the feet.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the bow normally within 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to lose hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
At the time of application, the water with a pretense should not fall back on the wrists.
After the wash is finished, the hands dry with sterile cloth and put on a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of microbes, better wash your hands or use antiseptics for hands before and after treatment.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent were the most beneficial for washing hands and that very few additional benefits were obtained when hand washing was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared with antibacterial soap, handwashing with conventional soap results in more than threefold an increase in the frequency of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The comparison of handwashing with alcohol-containing solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that handwashing with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial soap.
However, honey and water are still more effective than hand-washing solutions, in order to reduce the amount of influenza A H1N1 and the dispute of Clostridium difficile; health care activities in medical institutions may include training of hand-washing personnel, increasing the availability of hand-washing solutions, and written and oral reminders of the need to wash hands.
Additional research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing is recognized as an economically effective and important means of improving health and even food.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to get used to washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are far from every private or public toilet there are hand washing taps, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, inadequate hand hygiene can also be caused by the roots rather than by the lack of soap or water.
Propaganda and the promotion of handwashing can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefit of handwashing and bring about long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the health situation in countries with lower average incomes, effective community health and epidemic surveillance, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example is the Three Star Approach Child Fund approach: it promotes the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that encourage washing hands using soap, as well as other health requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The establishment of hand-helds is one of the possible measures implemented in the context of hand-care campaigns to reduce the level of disease and child mortality.
The World Day of Hand Washing (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 crown virus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of hand washing emotions.
Some studies examined the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared with DALYs (reserved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that the stimulation of washing hands with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by two innovators in the middle of the 19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), an English nurse and a “founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by the smells of rotting called myasms.
In 1980, in connection with outbreaks of diseases spread through the food contract and infections related to medical care, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany near handicrafts in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports, posters with “correct hand washing techniques” were hung.
The phrase “to wash hands” means the expression “to refuse to accept responsibility for anything or to participate in anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” when deciding on Jesus Christ’s enthronement; then this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play, Lady McBeet begins to wash her hands in an effort to get rid of an imaginary Friday, symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes that she committed herself and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical action tend to wash their hands more often than others, and that handicrafts were more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In religion the washing of hands is both hygienic and symbolic. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without mercy, is part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including Baha'ism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require compulsory hand washing after a visit to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
Control of production factors with respect to COVID-19 involves the application of methods to ensure safety of work and health in order to control the risk and control of coronal viruses in 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of workplace risks depends on the place and job, based on risk assessment, the severity of the community epidemic and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that low-risk posts had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures were needed to combat infection, including hand washing, encourage workers to stay at home with signs of disease, respect for the respiratory label, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with persons with no confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but there is a likelihood of infection due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
Such a category may include public workers, such as schools, high-density working environments and some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical and morgue personnel who contact a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk; however, the risk is increased to a very high level when conducting aerosol education procedures or collecting/processing samples from a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures for such staff include the use of technical and technical safety equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the relevant task.
The rash of COVID-19 can produce different kinds of effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be at work because of their own illness, the need to care for others or because of fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary both with regard to the types of goods on which demand is made and with regard to the means of acquiring such goods (e.g. purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).
Finally, the supply of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The plans address risks related to various workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from home and community, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also identify the means of control necessary to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for disaster preparedness and response can be made subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus to staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health difficulties, to maintain business operations and to minimize the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses affect the degree of severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located.
The risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in the provision of safety and health at work to group such funds according to efficiency.
If it is not possible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19, the most effective technical and technical security tools, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Safety engineering means isolation from work-related risk and do not rely on employee behaviour, which can be the most economical solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or an employee.
Personal protection funds (PPE) are considered less effective than technical or administrative measures, but may help to address some risks.
All types of personal protection should be selected depending on the threat to the worker, the size (e.g. respirators), the use of regular and appropriate checks, maintenance and replacement, as appropriate, and the correct collection, cleaning and storage or disposal of the infection.
The U.S. Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that the least-risk posts have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including closing of the hand with cough and chewing, supplying soap and containers for garbage, ready to remove or change, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as day-to-day cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially infected is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with symptoms of severe respiratory diseases remain at home until the end of the burn, lack of an increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antifungal agents or other medications to eliminate symptoms, as well as that staff members should be allowed to stay at home to care for their sick family member and to be aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no confirmed data or suspicions of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection with respect to the spread of disease in the territory of the business or with recent visits to the place of spread of COVID-19.
These categories include executives in the field of public contact, such as schools, working environments with high population density and some large retail stores.For such groups and groups with higher risk, executives in the field are responsible for establishing high-efficiency air filters, increasing the intensity of ventilation, establishing physical barriers, establishing transparent plastic protection screens, and installing non-carrying client service counters.
In rare cases, workers in such a group may need to carry respirators.
If a person is in a plane, appropriate measures are required to ensure the safety of workers and other passengers, such as the isolation of the sick person from other people at 6 feet, the appointment of a member of the crew to take care of the sick person, the provision of a sick mask or the treatment of such a person with a request to cover his nose and mouth with a helmet or a spoon.
Second-stage crew members must wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when they are in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if they have a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other disposable items used should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the infected surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, the safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, isolation and immediate information of the medical centre on board a ship when hot or other symptoms are present on board.
Ideally, medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and care facilities for children, the CDC recommends that a short-term closure be made for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average level of spread of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as cancellation of personal meetings, meetings and other mass activities, such as exercise in physico-culture or cowpein, admission of food in cafeterias, increased distance between parties, adjustment of arrival and care time, restriction of non-essential visits, use of a separate location of health institutions for children with influenza symptoms.
In addition to social exclusion strategies, significant local distribution rates can be considered for long-term school absences. For law enforcement officials who perform daily duties, direct health risks are considered to be low, according to the CDC.
It is recommended that law enforcement staff contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection should follow the same instructions as those prescribed for early assistance, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their formal straps and equipment before reuse by means of domestic cleaning aerosols or by spraying, comply with standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of the disease and the use of personal protective equipment, as well as for the use and use of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health institutions and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory and transport personnel who contact patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in aerosol education procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Aerosol education procedures include sensitization, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling of invasive methods.
High-risk Mortgage Workers include staff dealing with confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such staff are exposed, they are classified as very high-risk; additional safety engineering equipment for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including in aerosol education procedures.
In some health and morgue institutions, special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Tests should be carried out in accordance with the precautions provided for the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be allocated to separate waiting areas, depending on the suspicions of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protection measures, OSHA recommends that workers who are working at a distance of up to 6 feet with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and persons who are conducting aerosol education procedures.
In the United States, approved NIOSH respirators for N95 or higher class filter should be used in an integrated written respirator protection programme, which specifies the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of special care because COVID-19 is a respiratoryly transmitted disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for screening staff at the patient reception point.
For persons who collect respiratory samples in patients with COVID-19 or carriers without aerosol education procedures, WHO recommends wearing surgical masks, protective eyes or protective screens for persons, gloves and gloves.
In conducting aerosol education procedures, a respirator N95 or FFP2 should be carried instead of a surgical mask.
In view of the lack of individual protection facilities around the world, WHO recommends that such protection facilities be minimized by the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent rings, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, use only of the personal protection funds required for a specific purpose, the continued use of the same respiratory agent without taking away, while working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection funds and recommending not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

Theme: [Covid-19] Relief and preparation for the future
EXPIRY DATE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DECISIONS: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationship between people of the world and our responsibility to one another.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to feel, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relationships between all our colleagues, as reflected in the electronic correspondence, phone calls and chats, a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunate people are working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was told that our work was highly appreciated.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have the opportunity to visit Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether it is to ensure the functionality of the sites, to pay by our colleagues or to protect the safety of communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever.
In order to achieve significant results for peace, it is important not only what we do but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order of our joint work, starting next week.
Correcting our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the C-team team gathered yesterday evening to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to remove tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step back, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and out-of-office staff:
In our expectations, it will take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next orders are received.
We do not announce the departure days: if you can work normally for more hours, this will be permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, we do not predict the world now; whatever your needs, whether you care for your family, buy food, or go to the doctor’s office, your well - being is our number one priority.
We're not following your schedule.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable and undisputed, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to form a hospital letter or reply: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, inform Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from the guidance to your situation).
Time rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with our obligations to our contractors and hourly rate staff.
Each person will be paid according to normal weather rates applied under normal conditions.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their jobs as a way to make their efforts around us.
What we do can bring surprising results, especially in such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to contact our manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (in addition to others) are carrying out critical work for which additional support may be required.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess the current objectives and focus on providing support, which is extremely important to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
The delay today does not mean a negative impact in the future.
We do not intend to work “two more to cover the missing” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic times for the current time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed and that we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to meet the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadline for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, while providing a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all who need or want to work.
Such an extension of time limits would significantly reduce the current burden on planning and tension across the organization.
The following week, we will present our proposal to the Council, the representatives and the teams with relevant information on the following steps immediately after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leading role in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we found out that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
In addition to many precautions, however, we have hired an anti-virus treatment team to disinfect all the surfaces of the office in San Francisco.
They used the anti-virus solutions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules that require caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Colombia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all of the personnel in DC with its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in the District of Colombia moved completely to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we have also discussed the issue of renting a room in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work far away for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work far away are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If necessary, consider dividing them into a course of several days.
Make clear the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and advance the information.
By default, use video communication to facilitate interaction and communication with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator — a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for taking notes (or sharing views).
If necessary, contact the e-mail technical support service.
Take advantage of Wellness Reimbursement when buying snacks.
Join the channel #remotes in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics manuals available in web form to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel the mass activities financed by Wikimedia, such as Editathons, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may involve the impossibility of carrying out concerted action on grants, and no one will be penalized for the delays or changes in such objectives.
Next week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The overall mood in the global community is not only a feeling of frustration over the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief over the understanding and opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not just themselves.
With regard to prospects, CRT is working on a page in Meta-Wiki, which will provide space for the community to monitor the impact and society.
We remain in contact with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
This time, we take advantage of the opportunity to share more information, answer your questions, and share time with each other.
We're in this situation together, and we're ready to help everyone as much as we can.
You can continue to receive information from such an e-mail and other important information about COVID-19 from the Office of Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular communication with staff living in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, activities, key workflows, information awareness problems or other assistance, please contact the CRT.
We are ready to support and communicate as necessary.
If there are any confidentiality issues, please contact Brian Judene (Bryan Juden), director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it recognizes the current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and our commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to enable us to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planning work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to provide support for one another and to create space for important work in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
To do so, we will need help from each one of you; and we will need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with the utmost effect as soon as that need arises.
Now, please, help your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells in light, arteries, heart, thighs and bladder.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the relevant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for treating cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into the cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ester located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
White ACE2 contains the N-conceived peptide domain M2 and the S-conceived transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single-step type I membrane, and its fermentedly active domain falls on the surface of light and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is extracted from the transembedded domain by another enzyme known as sediment, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane most of the mild alveolar cells of type II, the enterocytes of the thin bladder, the arterial and venous endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of the majority of the organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 and RNA are also found in the brain’s core, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an antidote to ACE.
ACE secretes the hormone angiotensin I into the adjacent angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, extracts the carboxylate amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also spread a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, appellate, neurosine, dinomorphine A and grelline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 carrier and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembed protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for certain coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-induced virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-induced virus).
Simply put, binding the S1 strain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocitosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomals located inside the cell.
This entry also requires the use of the S-type TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with AFP and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Furthermore, “pneumonia risk has also been reduced in patients receiving AFP inhibitors who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of AFP inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be novel in the treatment of severe mild injuries and appears to improve legit haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in patients with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes apart from the duration of exposure at 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising tool for people with the infertility of classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or those with angiotensin II circulating diseases. The rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Annexes COVID-19 are applications for mobile phones intended for assistance in epidemiological investigation in the context of a pandemic of the crown virus 2019-20, i.e. identification of persons (‘contacts’) who could contact the infected person.
In some regions, a number of annexes have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several applications were developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, particularly those systems that are based on the geographical location of the users of the applications.
More flexible options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user ' s proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate support for such applications on the basis of Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, deployed an application that enables citizens to check whether they were in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities.
The annex has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted under the control of the Government. North Macedonia has launched the StopKorona annex, which works on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides an operational link with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and by the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the application was expected to register in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that an application for contact tracking was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether Annex and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use a geosonation function to ensure that patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with applications-based systems, including false design and potential inefficiency in the use of only a small part of the population.
Taking into account the concern about the spread of misleading or harmful “Kronavirus” attachments, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their Crown Virus-related annexes to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
The participants in the campaign for the protection of privacy expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through applications related to the crown virus; in particular, the question was raised whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the crown virus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat would disappear.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of such supervision.
The organizations announced eight conditions for their public projects:
Monitoring shall be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations on limitation of time;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The data security and anonymity shall be protected and evidence of such protection shall be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of an increase in discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties shall be defined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders) (RSF) also published their lists.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as necessary.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of annexes, which excludes the need to load the annex and the possibility to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network monitoring was approved.
Network solutions that have access to baseline location data also have major potential issues of confidentiality.
However, not all central servers systems should have access to location data; a number of confidentiality systems were developed that used central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that did not use the annexes as a basis has been used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with the infected, but has also made information on the location of the public available, which has become possible due to significant changes in the information protection legislation that have been introduced since the outbreak of the MERS in the country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of annexes and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been published.
As of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on confidential solutions such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and are not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include a decentralized process with the maintenance of confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mechanisms to track mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identified personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is involved in the development of SafePaths, a platform for maintaining confidentiality in collecting and using data on location or cross-section of ways to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research published in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” (“Applications: how to maintain confidentiality during the epidemic”), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops confidentiality technologies, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to enable users to exchange confidential location and health data with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of applications for tracking and reporting, which is a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the source code BlueTrace used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020 Google and Apple, companies that control the work of mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced an initiative to track contacts that they claimed would ensure confidentiality and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography that allows for confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Development of tools for Governments to establish official annexes to monitor the movement of citizens infected with the crown virus, but with the maintenance of data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with permanent surveillance, first by introducing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it the same way after the threat disappeared.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription (also known as ‘re profile’, ‘rehabilitation’, ‘rehabilitation’, ‘rehabilitation’ or ‘therapeutic rehabilitative’) is the rehabilitation of an approved medicinal product in order to treat a disease or a medical condition different from the disease originally intended for development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective ways of treating COVID-19.
Other studies include the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 and the transfer of recombinant plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are affected by medicinal products, each of which has several binding ligand sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides an appropriate basis for the development of an effective anti-viral agent against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important targets for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, gelax, S protein and ADF-ribofosphatase.
Hussain AA and co-authors in their clinical study have studied several candidates ' associations, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity in the structure with the most-like approved medicinal products to speed up the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be included in the four medicinal products studied in the “Solidarity” clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tests would begin in the state of New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with an emergency authorisation (EUA).
The treatment schedule was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and was approved according to the USA only as an emergency treatment for patients hospitalized but unable to receive treatment under the clinical trial schedule.
CDC stated that “the use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the medicine when there is “no other way out”.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquin in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langone studies the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of the use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uhana and Shenchen showed that favipirine was “simply effective”.
35 patients in the Schengen area who took this medicine had a negative result on average after 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take it had a disease duration of 11 days.
A study was conducted in Uhan, where 240 pneumonia patients were monitored, one half of whom received favipiride, and the other half of whom received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority reminded the public that the results of the product ' s effectiveness were poor and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to fill its stocks and that it would be delivered to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19, using military resources.
According to South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abe informed the Tramp Administration of the possibility of buying a product, and the product could be less effective in cases of disease.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or patients who are trying to become pregnant.
A study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Calétra) antivirals concluded that “the efficacy of medicinal products has not been established”.
Preparations have been developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is attempting to modify medicinal products to find a compound that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there are criticisms of the re profile of medicinal products that have been specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Remdesiver has been developed and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections.
One of the problems associated with anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical trials are currently being carried out, including two university clinics in Cleveland; one is carried out in patients with moderate disease and the other in patients with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted to internalize vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, tests of the antibiotics of azithromycin began in New York State.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclesonide) Tejina, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for its use in the treatment of pre-symptom patients infected with new coronary virus.
Phase II test, the form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, is conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine treatment effectiveness.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchickin in reducing sleepiness and lung complications in patients with low-expressed COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older diagnosed with COVID-19 were invited with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and who are not using effective contraception cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, there are several conagulants on the test.
Low molecular cheparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish recommendations on the use of this medicine.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients on the use of enoxaparin sodium at preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been paid to the retraining of approved anti-virus products that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th Chinese recommendation.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with Chinese recommendations 7th
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for treatment with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Tests also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronal virus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has been tested, numerous attempts have been made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, the outbreak of this disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investments in the development of the vaccine and its research activities.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI initiative on vaccine development are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technological platforms at the research and development stage to establish an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the Phase I security studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenvirus vector)
As reported by CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more candidates were reported, but there is little available information (probably at the planning or development stage).
Phase I-II pre-tests on safety and immunogenicity are usually randomized, placebo-controlled and several sites with more accurate and effective doses at the same time.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including the control group; at this stage, preparations are tested for disease prevention and side effects at optimal doses are monitored at the same time.
Of the 79 active-designed vaccine candidates (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested per person (are still in clinical trials).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular vaccine that genetically modified virus proteins to stimulate the immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine in order to begin human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen and Hanneke Schuitmeaker announced the start of work on the establishment of their vaccine.
Janssen, together with his partner on biotechnology, is developing an oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, the Emergency BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a technology vaccine similar to that used for neo-anti-cancer vaccination on 8 February 2020.

On 27 February 2020, Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that the Peptide Ii-Key against COVID-19 project had begun.
Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate that could be tested in people for 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington, St. Louis, announced its projects for the development of a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army of Medical Research and Materials, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reid Research Army, Silver Spring, located in the western part of the state of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, the Emergency Biosolutions announced that it had entered into partnership with Novavax Inc.
to develop and produce a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for clinical trials and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that it would take not less than two-and-a-half years to develop the vaccine in an accelerated manner.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnological company, Quebec, reported that they had been created by the Canadian Institute of Health Research with partial funding.
The potential vaccine is being conducted in laboratory studies and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large amounts of money” for exclusive access to Covid-19, against which the Government of Germany protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced the conclusion of a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an RNA vaccine.
BNT162 is an IRN-based candidate for the vaccine; the product is currently undergoing clinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of clinical trials in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate could start testing in people in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Epidemiology Innovation Coalition (CEPI), France, announced the investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the Pittsburgh University.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing self-adopt COVID-19 RNA.
The vaccine candidate product was developed within 14 days of the receipt of consistency from China.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of $275 million to 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national “bank of vaccines”, where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new outbreak of the crown virus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stating that “MNA introduced subunital vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong responses to the antigen-specific antibody [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmaceuticals of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential vaccine based on DNA, which might be released as a nasal spray.
Bacterial DNA will multiply within human bacteria and produce harmless viral particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. Government, industry and three universities pooled the IBM supercomputer resources combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages than disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of animal models with COVID-19, such as ACE2-transmitted mice, other laboratory animals and lower prisms, indicate the need for biosafety 3 control measures in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in animal models.
As of 2020, there were no medicinal products or protective vaccines for the treatment of SARS that would be safe and effective for people.
According to research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions worldwide.
At the time of the start of the spread of MRS, it was considered that the SARS study, which was carried out at that time, could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against the infection of MRS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS-based vaccine, which took place in phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in development, two were adenviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA-vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Social networks have spread the theory of the conspiracy, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not entirely new and that the vaccine already exists.
Social media publications quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents for the genetic sequence of other strains of the coronary virus, such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (CVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe severe respiratory disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of circulation, and pain in life.
The time between first and peak symptoms is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases involve mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and poly-organism deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread in close contact with one another, often through microscopic drops of air in cough, cough or conversation.
Although these droplets are formed when they breathe, they usually pose a threat, either to the ground or to the surface, but are not transmitted through long-range air.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most infected during the first three days after symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeric chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as well as a bone marrow.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease as well as for caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks differ among the population: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend using them, and others require them.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment from COVID-19.
Local prevalence of disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infectious people may have no symptoms or symptoms of influenza, such as illness, cough, fatigue, and search.
Extensive symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or chest tightness, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, face or mouth; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Swellings may be observed in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, hives or throat pain.
Also, different percentages of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are observed.
Some cases of disease registered in China were initially merely a feeling of depression in the chest and a heart attack.
In some cases, the disease may progress as a result of pneumonia, a polyorganized deficiency, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection; according to the available data, symptoms are not present in all infected people.
The role of such unsymptom carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data show that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of unsymptom-infected people is currently unknown and is only being studied; Korean disease control and prevention centres (KCDCs) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus were unsymptom-free.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unsymptom cases in its daily summary from 1 April; of the 166 cases registered on that day, 130 (78%) were rejected as unsymptom at the time of testing.
Both wet and mucous membranes can have a high concentration of the virus.
In the case of noise, there are more drops in the air than in the case of normal noise.
The study conducted in Singapore showed that open shell caps can reach a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus to bioaerosol is possible, and the testing of air processed by air collectors in corridors outside the human room has shown the presence of the virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular rehabilitation, can lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through faeces, but this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms occur, but this risk is small.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that until it is quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people.
In particular, it has been found that the virus is able to live on a cardboard surface within one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days and 99 per cent of the honey surface up to 4 hours.
These indicators vary, however, depending on the humidity and temperature.
Mile and molybdenum, when properly used, have a useful effect on the fight against infection: it destroys the virus ' s fatty layer, deactivation it, and is able to remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. During a study conducted in Hong Kong, samples of the spleen were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest levels of the virus in the blood were detected on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome, first found in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in relatives of the nature of coronary viruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which covers its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the baseline SARS-CoV.
Light is the body most affected by COVID-19 as the virus penetrates into the host cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common in mild type II alveolar cells.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and penetrates into the housing cell using a typical surface glycoprotein, “ship” (peplometer).
12 per cent of the infected people in the Uhana hospital were diagnosed with severe myocardial infarction, which is more common in the severe form of the disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they participate in the body.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients with IOC with COVID-19 and may be evidence of adverse forecasts.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic to ACE2-expressive epithelial cells of respiratory pathways, symptoms of systemic hyperstimulation are observed in patients with severe COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that pathogen GM-CSF T-cells are correlated with recruiting inflammatory monocytes that allocate IL-6 and a severe pathology for patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been found during exposure.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
Polymeric chain reaction in real-time mode (RT-PCR) is a standard method of testing.
The test is usually carried out on breathable samples obtained from the nostalgia, but the nostalgia or wet tissue may also be used.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken every two weeks and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the strains of the coronary virus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests on their own by means of a polymeric chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect infection at the current time, as well as the possibility of infection in the past, were under development but had not yet been widely disseminated.
China ' s experience in examining the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was between 60 and 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Medicinal Products Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-the-spot diagnosis test, authorized its application at the end of this month.
The bilateral multi-layer sub-pleural focusses of mating glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common symptoms detected early in the disease.
Sub-pleural domination, the symptom of the bluish bridge (due to the removal of the barrier with a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study carried out when it was discovered:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, swelling and swelling of the lungs
Four types of viral pneumonia may be observed:
mild form of pneumonia: swelling of the lungs, hyperplasia of the lungs, large atypical pneumonias, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudation.
DAD is the cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia: organization of alveolar discharges and leguminous interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse intrasession (DVS syndrome); Lecoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include housekeeping, avoiding human sites, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, applying respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a helmet or a cigarette, or that the mouth and nose be covered on the inside of the elbow area.
After coughing or chewing, it is recommended that a quality hand hygiene procedure be conducted.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular in order to limit the transmission of disease-free persons. Social remoteness strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens and abolished major public activities.
The distance recommendations also mean that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
Since the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, the main part of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as “platinum exit”.
CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or when hands are severely contaminated, as well as before eating and after swallowing, coughing or chewing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant containing alcohol (containment of at least 60 per cent of alcohol) for hand handling, but only where soap and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These components use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial alcohol disputes and is not a suitable tool for the antiseptic treatment of hands.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients have been shown to be supportive of therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other vitally important organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus should wear a regular medical mask.
Extraordinary membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory insufficiency, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, compliance with personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.
Supportive treatment methods can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, physicians in intensive therapy and pulmonology have summarised the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For the treatment of first-line symptoms, some medical personnel recommend taking paracetamol (acetaminophen) as compared to ibupropene.
In the implementation of procedures that may result in air-capture emissions, such as intubation or hand-drying, caution should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in medical institutions.
Medical personnel dealing with persons with COVID-19 recommend that CDC be placed in an AIR — an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC issued recommendations on the use of individual protective equipment (ISIS) during the pandemic.
Recommended means of individual protection: protective helmet, respiratory or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. From the above, it is preferable to use respiratorys rather than medical masks.
The N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorised the use of these respirators in accordance with the U.S. Emergency Authorisation.
They are designed to protect particulate matter in the air, such as dust, but there is no guarantee of effective protection against a specific biological agent when not using instructions.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective facial screens or, at least, making masks on their own in domestic conditions.
In most cases, the stream form of COVID-19 is not difficult enough to require artificial ventilation of light or alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory impairment associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, and some evidence is available that intubation can be avoided by means of a nasal oxygen canal with an intensive airflow or two-level positive air pressure in respiratory pathways.
Whether one of these two ways for patients in a critical state is as effective as IVL is not yet known.
Some doctors make a choice for invasive mechanical ventilation of light, if available, because this method significantly restricts the spread of particulates in the air compared to the nasal tract with intensive airflow. The risk of a severe form of disease for older people (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is no hospitalized chicken per capita, and health systems are too limited to cope with a sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in a severe form requiring hospitalization.
As a result of a study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care facilities, 2.3% needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4% had been completed.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually reanimated.
The task of ensuring artificial ventilation is complicated because the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing at COVID-19 and oxygenation are increasingly problematic.
Inhaled and PDKV-supported IVL is needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the light and to ensure their minimum ventilation damage, which may result in the development of pneumoturax.
In earlier fan models, high PCC may not be available.
Potential treatment trials began in January 2020, and several anti-virals are currently under clinical trial.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
The development of new medicinal products may take up to 2021, but some of the products tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antivirals can be tested in patients with severe forms of disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatment methods. FDA has granted temporary authorisation for the use of recombinant plasma as experimental treatment in cases where human life is at risk of serious or immediate danger.
It has not been used in clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak of the disease.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The Annex may identify “close contact” by means of monitoring data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the annex not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notification to local health authorities. The analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, identification technology, tracking of mobile phones and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and the persons they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security authorities to track data on mobile phones of people who were allegedly infected with the crown virus.
Measures were taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who could contact the infected.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of Deutsche Telekom, the Federal Government of Germany and Robert Koha Institute provided aggregate data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology was introduced to identify quarantine offenders.
The regional health authority of Italy, Julio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people are still moving around the territory”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour programming marathon for the starting days, involving more than 42,000 participants.
President Kersty Kalulyed also called for creative solutions against the spread of the crown virus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming mental health and well-being”.
The disease can flow easily with minor or absent symptoms that remind other common upper respiratory diseases, such as regular cold.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need between three and six weeks to be treated.
Women who are pregnant may be at a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 on the basis of data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data on COVID-19 are not available.
People with the most severe disease of COVID-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory insufficiency, septic shock or polyorgan insufficiency.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, as well as problems with the heart, kidneys and liver.
Thrombo-forming anomalies, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6 per cent of patients entering a COVID-19 hospital, while 4 per cent of the group experienced a failure to wait.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the mean time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
Early-stage disease studies indicate that the median time between the onset of early symptoms and the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of lethal samples of light reveal diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromisoid exudations in both light samples.
Pneumocytes have seen viral cytopathetic changes.
The external appearance of a mild reminder of a severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and access to medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
The mortality estimates vary depending on the situation due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
A poorly effective case calculation can lead to an increase in mortality.
However, the fact that death is caused by previous diseases may mean that the current level of mortality is underestimated.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally developed 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or to die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The Administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had been cured of the disease had reduced slightly by 20-30 per cent and that their scans had detected injuries.
After recovery, this may also lead to “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether permanent immunity against patients who were cured from the virus was being developed.
According to the treatment of other coronary viruses, this was considered likely, but also reported cases where since the recovery from COVID-19 tests on the coronary virus were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an exacerbated period of disease, not re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, is the earliest date of the first case of the disease on December 1, 2019.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and the time of spread of the disease, and also affect the testing levels, the quality of health systems used in treatment schemes, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO granted emergency aid codes under ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a period of time.
According to statistics at Johns Hopkins University, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include the definition of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died from the disease and the definition of the death rate as a result of the communicable infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These statistics do not relate to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a specific population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all patients who have been infected, the number of people infected may be understood when such antibodies are present.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castilone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are no longer living.
In the city of Angelt, the disease spread during the celebration of carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The effects of pandemics and levels of mortality are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the level of mortality was higher than that of men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced from 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this difference are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural.
Gender immune differences, reducing the prevalence of male-related smoking (e.g. hypertension in men below the age of women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the United States Government has no gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and ERWI, have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization declared the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adana Gabrielus, explains: ‘CO’ means ‘krona’, ‘VI’ — ‘virus’, ‘D’ — ‘disease’, and 19 when the first outbreak was detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people as required by international recommendations on the name to prevent stigmatization. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is called a severe coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In the WHO public communications, the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” are used in addition.
And disease, and the virus itself is usually called kronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhana, China, the virus and the disease were usually called kronavirus and kronavirus.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on geographical locations in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended using the terms “A severe respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
Official names, “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations on standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as nose masks, as well as IVL equipment.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required timeframe, when one of the local productions was re-processed and able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various theories of conspiracy, disinformation and faecal information about the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects became widely available on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infected other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, rats and rats.
There is currently no approved vaccine from the virus or medicinal product for its treatment.
Vaccines and medicinal products from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY TEST) programme, which aims to assess the healing effect of four existing compounds that are considered most effective to date.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate into human cells using an ACE2 receptor, which is why the results of previous studies on SARS-CoV are used in scientific development.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First of all, researchers are trying to develop a full virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactivated or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a single vaccine, is aimed at establishing a vaccine, which enhances the sensitivity of the immune system to certain components of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are designed to destroy the S-chip protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of a vaccine based on nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new method for the establishment of a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. The first four volunteer clinical trial started in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a free genetic code, which is copied from a virus that causes the disease. Anti-thealizing strength has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Preparations approved for malaria treatment were evaluated during seven tests, four of which were based on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Prophylaxis of antivirals is a major part of Chinese studies; nine Phase III studies on remdesivir were conducted by the end of April in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing antiviral medicinal products for the treatment of COVID-19, including rheumatoid arthritis, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, in combination with beta interferon, were also considered.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the application of remdecivir are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdecivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was considered in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquin.
The Uhanian Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that the double dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also refer to interferon, ribavirin or umifenvir as a remedy against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for a detailed in vivo study, demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations.
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these treatment methods without a more detailed study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of a severe form of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of hypercytokinaemia.
The drug has gone to two stages of a nationally-response test in Italy after positive results have been obtained in patients with a severe disease.
In combination with the analysis of blood clots on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is intended to counteract factors that are considered to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved as an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies to treat the release syndrome of steroid refractory cytokines caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine-free syndrome.
Transfers of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 are currently considered as a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results have been inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus is an expected effect that allows passive anti-inflammatory therapy to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-theological cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also be used.
Other forms of passive anti-inflammatory therapy, such as monoclonal anti-inflammatory agents, are being developed.
There may be an increase in the volume of use of recombinant blood clots, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and contains antibodies to the virus.
