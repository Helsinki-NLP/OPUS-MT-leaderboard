Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway for 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, such as the fourth US President of History.
Diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, inter alia, through exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected him between 172 persons and 33 organizations.
The Presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with the king of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. President to receive it, although the third to receive it in his capacity.
The White House has already announced that, when receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country currently in war in two countries.
Their war efforts have increased even further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During its full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet that will be attended by the Prime Minister and 250 other guests, in addition to the Norwegian kings.
Obama had from the beginning a more reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defender of the accused nature of blackmail
The police of Litomérice accused of blackmailing the president of the association of nature defenders of Litomérice (Sociedad de Defensores de la natureeza Litomérice).
Last year he appealed several times against certain construction license procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded the money investors for their own benefit, said the spokesperson of the Litomérice Alena Romová police.
The President of the Sociedad de Defensores de la naturea Litoméríce is Lubomír Studnička.
Currently detained and facing a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like the containers too much to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of drinks and containers can be found in villages in southern Moravia to separate garbage everywhere.
And Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that Brno doesn't separate the trash for anything.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, towns are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally late in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but especially because of the number of containers for these wastes.
Have they ever tried, for example, to put a PET bottle in the center to the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the Moravské naměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
That Mr Onderka and his companions are not angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that in other parts it is not easy to separate the trash.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Per Vagance
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several bottles of glass and plastic into the trash.
But on Kaunicova Street, I didn't see any red containers near.
Fortunately, I found the right place by the train.
However, the trash was already in the back of the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be too interested in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city's hockey extraliga, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after a bit of browsing the Internet, with official statistics.
According to ECO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the entire region of Jihomoravský kraj.
Parobek's budget took away money from sickness income and subsidies
After the left, despite the opinion of the government, is added funds for farmers or officials, there may be insufficient money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt nor international disputes.
This will harm all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Hacienda Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the increase for some groups, it was believed that the government would subsequently apply for a loan for sensitive expenditures, incomes or sickness subsidies. "This is just a matter of delaying problems for the future, it is to put mines," Janota says.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher interest rates and, someday, you have to return the money.
The State does not have many options for making money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or State operating costs, taxes must be increased.
To all who added the left now: the bombers, teachers, farmers.
And later on, his children too.
People don't have to worry about sickness income or subsidies, they'll get them.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; the next year will not be less than 163,000 million, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will continue to increase together with the costs of interest.
The State will need money to cover them and will no longer achieve a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity subsidies, as the government has done in its deficit package.
Due to the disbursements of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, the next year will also be five billion to complete the construction of motorways and railways.
This is, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a salmonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the ČEZ dividends, which is mostly the property of the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bag without funds.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Every year, dividends are eliminated by ecological damage, used to complete the income account or serve as a reserve for the planned income reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit at 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to provide several compensation to the victims of communism and crime, or for the costs of disputes, including in the construction savings.
It is not clear whether the State will need those funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international dispute, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
After that, the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, throw out the government's budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million missing for the Staten Pologdna project (State Fund), whose price is two billion and which has already been started.
The first stage begins in January.
If the farmer does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smart phone can work with two operating systems
The U.S. will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans are promising.
With only one key pressed, they pass in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Exactly this option is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on developing virtualizing software for computers.
In your mobile you can take two user profiles at once.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
Both operate simultaneously, Srinivas Krishnamurti told VMware in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and it was shown for the first time several days ago.
It will be launched in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concerns hotel owners
Not only do teleschiers in Krkonoshe worry about snowless tracks.
The lack of snow makes people do not reserve ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoshe rooms can still be obtained for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but still fear to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases will be snow or clay," said Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův Mlýn a Nochevieja according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place may try to wait a few more days.
Špindlerův Mlýn hotels offer mostly weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon surrender and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, he loved Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered remain free.
That's why we've already prepared some Christmas stays lately," Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director mentioned.
The travel agency of Vrchlabí can still offer the Nochevieja in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
They also sell very well on the first 14 days of February, and the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkonoshe.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the snowless mountain.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will also be exhausted," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest is growing during Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja stays are already occupied at the hotel Omnia, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně in Christmas, half of the beds are still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, since we are about 60 percent of the capacity to occupy.
February has been a little weaker, but as snow falls, interest in the stays in Krkonoshe will certainly increase, said Erik Sporysch, the hotel manager Omnia.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hotels in Krkonoshe will pass the snowflakes waiting.
Thursday must fall the temperatures and, if there is precipitation, the mountains should snow.
But then the temperatures will rise again, Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
U.S.: Recurring is the mother of wisdom
It is comic that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, to whom he himself took for the stupidest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it was demonstrated that it was a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is the speech "like in Iraq" used several times, but it also failed to use the title of the January 2007 Bush Declaration for its own statement: "A new way forward".
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as "an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that nothing is being said about Iraq in the news today.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The camp captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander in charge of the Afghan General Stanley McCristal operation. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinated relations, subjected the indecisive gunmen in the White House to severe criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president was vacant for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so he cheated at least on the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he had previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama's entire strategy seems to be its goal, to start withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and ending this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well-organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. After him will remain the patriarchal tribal relations.
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy is shocked by its volunteerism.
During the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon", will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsibility, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect declaration of US defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphal withdrawal of the troops of Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic reversal for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that three years are missing for the presidential elections and therefore there is still much time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
The directors of Goldman Sachs bank will not receive cash bonuses again
The senior executives of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior directors will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to the agency Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way he has to take, mentioned the former investor banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has faced criticism of nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 30 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $2 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to record once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuses for bankers that exceed 25,000 pounds (approximately 712,000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received the Nobel Prizes in all the least Physical
Five women, which is a record number, today received the Nobel Prizes from King Carlos XVI Gustavo of Sweden in specialised and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, he was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as by his compatriot Jack Szzotak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel in chemistry received it by Israeli Ada Jonathan and U.S. Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of the ribosomas.
The last award, the Nobel Prize for Economics, was received by US Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a awarded woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis for all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each award collected the diploma, the Nobel Prize and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the case of several awards in each category, the prize shall be divided among themselves.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the Peace One, received it this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the dispute of having been awarded, since it is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that, in certain situations, wars are essential to achieving peace, although their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning to the Minister of Agriculture Eduard Janota, who is calling for his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for the coming year, approved on Wednesday by the House of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota's stay in the cabinet, will be the subject of her meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by President Radim Ochvat's spokesman.
On his stay in the office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the Budget Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163,000 million crowns.
The House of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the proposals on the left for transfers of funds and raised the money for employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they cover up the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the right, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucrat office, which was agreed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party, began to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to stop public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the state budget law; he said today during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been waiting a long time for "the serious problem", i.e. "the non-sustainable deficit" of the public farm.
According to him today, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among the political parties, could improve this situation, says the President.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is scary and that the government should think about its future existence.
The Vice-President of ODS, Petr Neczas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucrat cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words of "strong sentences".
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, responded to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is awesome, prepared for this year by former government of Topolánek. It will exceed 20 billion crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said the approval of the State budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film, Invictus: Invincible, reports a lot about the country, its fight and its victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles play them by American actors.
The story is about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the American winner actor of an Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to be interpreted into Eastwood's film.
Another important role is that of Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I will have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama on the world of the Million Dollar Baby boxing, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictitious president of the United States, and even of God in Almighty Evan. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation is still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to join his people through sports, and that is why he decides to join the rugby players, who belong to the outside world.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to make Mandela's story come to the movies.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as much as possible as the reality," Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, and be among the builders before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that when I held his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and had the feeling of knowing how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met with Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: "I look much taller in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Director Eastwood, Invictus: Invencible received positive reviews and also talked about ambitions for Oscar.
The movie critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the web page rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The Secret of Splendor About Norway Resolved: Russians Tested a Missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia concluded yesterday by acknowledging that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or a failure occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write about "Bulava" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but it shines.
During this trial, the 13th test, there was at first no problem.
At the end of the flight, new technical problems occurred in the apparatus.
The engine probably exploded in the third phase of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine, which was submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light about Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulvá".
The Norwegians have not hesitated from the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by saying that one cannot just talk about a failure.
The first two phases of the missile were sustained and the resultant was the third.
In previous cases, engines were immediately reported in the first phase.
Although none of the launches went completely smoothly, only six of the thirteen failed, according to the management of the Ministry of Defence.
The success of almost 50 percent full of optimism to the generals and therefore continues to say that "Bulava" one day will fly without problems and that it will even achieve ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the maximum of which is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the Moscow Cska
The legendary advocate Viacheslav Fetisov will again present himself at 51 years of age to a professional hockey meeting.
The world's former champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his team Cska Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the duel of KHL against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov graduated from his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently presides over the Cska.
After Denis Kulyash got hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov keeps practicing and has committed himself to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to one party.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the longest professional player of Russian hockey.
The legendary frontier Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford at the age of fifty-one years, during the entire season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The largest of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union won two Olympics, seven world championships, won the Cup of Canada and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Hall.
Hyundai met the demands of the unions. He will cancel all additional work
The direction of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all the extra work.
Exactly because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions declared on Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesperson of the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions a more Saturday shift.
We cannot give up our manufacturing plan, because it is essential. That is why we have proposed additional volunteer work for Saturday, December 19, that is to say, it will work on two shifts," Vaněk said.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vanňka, the company decided to change how to motivate its employees with additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend Christmas parties in one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the extra work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped last week's manufacturing, the management immediately decided to cancel all the extra work for December, Vaněk said.
Car workers were forced to work two hours more than eight hours in addition to shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, trade unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between factory management and trade unionists should take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kucharæ unions said on Wednesday, that if they commit themselves to meeting the requirements and sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation in the car factory worsened last Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went into strike by frequent extra work.
They also protested against the bad pay conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply cars.
The trade unionists in their statement of emergency by strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, last Wednesday, interrupted the manufacture, were punished in any way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions require the company to reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year a salary of 5,000 crowns is required for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The serial manufacturing started last November.
Until last September he made about 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'accumulated' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists provides evidence of new compounds capable of moderateing the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, such as some available medicines already.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be prolonged significantly thanks to a mixture of medicines that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely removed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, medicines no longer work.
The work of the experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that the substances called metalliccarbons have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of HIV virus.
Metalcarbons are compounds of iron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all medicines used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the virus albumin.
Metalcarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhydric cells composed of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are joined by the atom of metal, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious body cells of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are combined by a short organic series, which remains systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of HIV proteases was carried out in evidence, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the metalocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, however they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metalocarbons interesting components for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rézáčová, head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for the coming year is "excellent" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
ODS statements were noted by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time left for the analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Neczas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nejac, the Prime Minister has to decide whether the House of Deputies wants to support the minority, who is trying to combat the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Neczas warned.
The House of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments on the left, by more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government denounced the ODS proposals, as they were covering up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the room before the vote and thus met the Government's wish, that the modified budget was better than a provisional budget.
Dissolved and useless
Hacienda Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would reassess the current situation.
At the same time it is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká TV Janota requested a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he's thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is their disappointment at the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government, they have nothing to do with the ČSSD nominees, who imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear whether he will resign, if the House adopts other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to subsidies on sickness, income or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are free
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text message.
He recalled that in several ministries in the position of locals, there were people who belonged to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nekas stressed that if Fischer decides to postpone the principle of combating the public farm deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which is based on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the House of Deputies".
However, it cannot count on the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I have not thought about it, when it is time, I will take care of it, told journalists in the House of Deputies Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by members of the ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went out in the afternoon to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS submitted at the request of the Prime Minister
Nekas stressed that ODS would probably vote against the modified budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask ODS Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, we have responded to the question, if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in Parliament and the Czech Republic during the negotiations on the budget.
He didn't realize that my vote was missing.
By giving up the mandate, I knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolsheviking of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek reacted itself.
According to the new ČD train schedule, less trains will be circulating at almost the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Ferrocarriles) will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains from 13 December and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule enters into force.
Most of the rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More opportunities for links to the capital will, for example, win the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, drahys for this line will add a pendolin career.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not circle again in Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will circulate less fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drift is in the Hradec Králové region, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice track and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the Lysá nad Labem line in Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nadraží station.
ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will circulate every two hours.
From 13 December travellers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive the year that comes four billion crowns in total, as this year. The local trains will be charged by the regions, the year that comes will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains drags have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year old.
Drahhy is happy with the system, and maybe that's why they didn't increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will only take place on one day's tickets - ČD Net and on eLiška's cheap internet tickets.
For travellers with no customer card, the price ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, so far there has been the unique price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Armed Filipinos continue to arrest more than 50 people, children were released
Armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
That is what the AFP agency said, which previously reported only about 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children detained and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use hostages as a live shield in the flight to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, armed forces belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), an armed group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police had previously prosecuted kidnappers for violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was due to the recent murder, in which 57 people died, imposed the martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 murder, related to the governor's elections, there were 30 journalists.
Suspected of involvement in the killing, the governor of this province was arrested in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed the peace dialogue on Tuesday with the Philippine government.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official title in Czech esInvictus: Neporažený) is released in the United States, which captures part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the leading role Mandela himself.
The second role, that of the legendary champion in rugby Francoise Pienaar, Matt Damon interpreted it.
With the external born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world football championship in the Republic of South Africa culminate. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the population by the ruling black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by Hollywood's "little interesting" stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new movie.
For many years I dreamed of the paper and prepared well for it.
Many times I found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as it is said - collect their energy, mentioned in an interview after the party scene in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's character and message through the film.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, he added.
On the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of residents, racially and for many years apart. Just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as a protagonist also puts on the dress of the national South African team of rugby and goes into the field. RSA won the world Cup at that time.
To get into the grumble in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations fourteen years ago, especially the white public and the recognition of the white people.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned the Rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as he said in a recent interview for LN a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In Loonsko a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
The fire has taken a transformer from the company Čeps in a switch box near the village of Výškov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Lukaš Marvan, the spokesperson for the bombers in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the bombers wanted the transformer to be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed their opinion and the fire was extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, to the company's voice, and there was no risk of safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová, it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps' activity, nothing like this happened, such avarices are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the voice of the ČEZ society for the north Czech Republic, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire of the electricity substation does not affect the operation of households, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps took place in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive holder of the distribution system, of the electrical conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electrical drive of 4339 kilometers long.
Jancura will file a complaint for slander to three ČSSD hostages
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jancúra today will file a complaint for slander to three Social Democratic Hetmans.
This is the case of Michal Haszek de la region South Moravian region, Radko Martínek de Pardubicý region and el hetman de Olomoucký region Martin Tessarík.
Jancura mentioned it in twenty minutes in Radiojournal.
The demand has to do with the company's efforts to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
However, all regions concluded long-term contracts with České Dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taken pasta", however, we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They say that we are more expensive than České dáhy, which is not true. We know the prices of České dáhy, which were set last week.
So there's nothing left for us to defend.
It is for the slander to the Student Agency society, he said to Radiojournal Jancura.
He mentioned at the same time having evidence from all regions, according to which he did not take the necessary measures in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Haszek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jančura's media show, which serves as a free advertising for his company and himself.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region, and I appeal to the other Hetmans who do so too.
I believe that, on this occasion too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jancura manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Haseek said.
Jancura announced last week, which would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
Radiojournal told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign would be carried out against corruption as such.
Jancura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dáhy to maintain regional railway links and for the charge of approximately 150 billion crowns they did not call a tender.
According to Jancura, similar steps are in conflict with the law and the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jancura claims to have been threatened by a Member of ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't let it go, we could lose bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of ČSSD, I know what you are talking about, I am not going to say his name, Jancúra said today for Radiojournal.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will end the usual habits.
As the first vaccine should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions have already appeared that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute of Medicinal Products is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also made it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January, children born from 2 August last year may receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to immunize their children against pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are required to immunise younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccines.
Without breast-feeding, you will save on the treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500 thousand per year on the entire vaccination of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of moderate otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of the nemococal infections in our country every year, 28 children under the age of 10 die according to hospital research.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the neococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, opinions appear at the same time, which this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Its association has been spreading pneumococal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path that we now have to take, said Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this moment we do not think so at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, doctors say
La Presidenta de la sociedade de pediatras Professional company of practical children's doctors Hana Cabrnoch's recognition that la vaccuna volonaria has sus devantajas.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, we could reason on the reduction in the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand relatively the political decision to have initiated the vaccination as voluntary," Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that from the coming year more than 80 percent of young parents will be vaccinated against pneumococcals in their babies.
The pneumococal vaccine is also a major change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gave them other vaccines.
Some Members, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "draw money from health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40 thousand per month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of the renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was trapped while carrying 90 paintings on his vehicle and his trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the region of the Pocono Mountains.
Frazetta Father, 81 years old, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan el Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Associated Press News Agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer said that a family dispute could have motivated young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told the police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said that Frazette Dad refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and expenditure cuts in the previous budget report, in view of the criticism of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling "disposal" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the cut-off of the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Hacienda also received severe criticism for harming low and medium-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security expenditure and a 1% peak in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Clarification for Social Security
The unions have regretted that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which states that this is a employment tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
POSTS OF THE ATERNAL REPORT TO THE BUDGET
Social security with an additional 0.5 per cent increase from April 2011
The economy will contract more than 4.75 % this year
New tax of 50 % on banker bonds
1 point of corporation tax for small firms was disposed of
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £ 30,000 will lose £90 per year and who earns £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who earns £ 10,000 per year will earn £ 110.
The ministers said that their goal of reducing the deficit by half for 2013 was "hard decisions", but they insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be higher than 5% of the highest wages.
The Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, denied that the tax increases and cuts of expenditures were a "grape of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," the BBC told him.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again toward the end of the year.
However, the forecasts of the Labour Party regarding future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be paid and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would probably contract in 4.75 % this year, much worse than the fall of 3.5 % predicted in April, while the loan claim would be £3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Exposed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who launched a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the "debt crisis" of the labor party, said that the loan application projection of £ 789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
The Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how the money would be returned, adding, "cynically" to the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have included nothing significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, win who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a greater reduction in the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats stated that the money collected by tax increases and cuts of expenditure would be used to support the expenditures of next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "Arena castles".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for advertisements, such as the increase in the inflation of some subsidies due to the inability of the month of April, mentioned earlier, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to charges of electoral manoeuvres, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided the most needed and will review the situation in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 expenditure data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public expenditure would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Tax Studies said that the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really delaying the pain for later," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important ads will come after the election, win who wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant of Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget, and the markets are aware of this."
The FBI is inquiring about "United States detentions in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a row at a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S.A. last month.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he was also looking for information on men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are going to be very interested in the positions by which they have been detained and under what circumstances they are being held," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," said the speaker.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said that the house was already in the eye of the local police and that charges against detainees had not yet been presented.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters news agency; but said the United States had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people".
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International Condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equal to the disabled, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the "models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said they had beaten him and burned him with cigarettes, another said they threatened him with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused the greatest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Tens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the story of Ibrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the outcome of the elections.
"They often hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and they released him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semi-scientific.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that they had been abused.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed to have been detained in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the ill will of the post-election and government response, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee's investigations had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski trail was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was quite frightening.
It is seen under a beautiful view of the lights of the city, titled.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have asked for a ban on the construction of mines and where there is a generalized warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually being integrated) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's last work "Why the French don't like the veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide 5-6 million Muslims from France what Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim uses a bank system based on interests to obtain a mortgage?
These are seemingly secular issues, it supports, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of reputation, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
The Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the Muslim values and French laicism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategies (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than growing pragmatism, it perceives "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most devastating panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that can't survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave valuable evidence facing the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old cadette, fighting only with the end of his musket, is probably a myth, but others are true.
The creatures, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly extinct mothers, were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are still generally a millionth of the area of a wild adult. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear living in Singapore is green for algae growing within its hairless areas.

Ellis uses stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to species survival.
Although it is banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and motorcyclists use high-power assault rifles to destroy their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Aun Anderson, an old editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scalable story about Arctic science and an overtaking view of how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change.
It's not a lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneer trips at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century indicated for the first time the movement of the ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the moving ice chains that flow below the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks within the extraordinary, small world of the influxing system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater rinsings that are compressed while freezing.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic marvels of the interior, they are all condemned once the ice of the summer is removed, which is believed to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 that put crowns in Arlington's graves
19-year-old De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put one crown in the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
Within a few months, from where we are being boarded, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of the veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morril Worcester, the owner of the Crown Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morril and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities along the way, to organize events dedicated to military and terrorist victims.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of the Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in the National Cemetery of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site by Flight 93 of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said he made a trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a military career loser.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the broad meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed for the oldest graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they did not receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples were taken out of hand, while they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red link attached to the top.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud carved names on the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed within the wet soil, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed tears in front of her son's grave.
He managed eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of the shipyard Sgto. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, he said.
"I want someone to remember after my death."
Cuban officials arrested a US government contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile and portable computers in the country, officials of the State Department said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
Specific duties have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered "hazardous".
All activities called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
The graffiti against government and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a leading community blogger, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and accused by government agents.
Sanchez has requested permission on several occasions to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been refused.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor can probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a "slow pace" approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and expensive products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Department of Interest in Havana, said that most of the United States citizens in the prison in Cuba are amongst the snares of crime such as drug trafficking.
Bernena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly uncertain.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as free mobile distribution, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the American Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's location as the country's leader, to replace his older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
It showed that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban Government often caused a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries began to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities neutralized the supposed brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops, expressing their hope that the case could help to destabilize an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who use the Internet to search for radicalized young people.
Researchers said they were pursuing an insurgent mysterious figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case on Saturday showed that Saifullah could not convince Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing northwest mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covered operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the officer said, who spoke from the anonymous because of the delicateness of the case.
The officer said that the men had not been immutable and were even trying to obtain adequate approval to access the Qaeda camps, when the Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determines who they are.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence has made it a priority to try to infiltrate people within the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guardians, not letting those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said that Qaeda looks at American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to U.S. goals and because of their value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those they admit, because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment model than how many have already followed? Kohlmann manifested.
It has been transformed into a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding negotiators working at the City's Bella Center Convention Centre, more bold climate action.
The protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the United Nations-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding English banners saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "The Earth says "that's enough".
Several famous members joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that Peru's travels, her mother's native country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with because of the impacts of the climate change that are already happening."
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world's leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, it has manifested.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for more time.
The police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or the wearing of wallet knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate discussions, activists with sports masks and black-handeds placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started as bells, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he answered in English, "I really wasn't at all in the situation."
Then he kept saying in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each one to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said that this showed the attention of the public in general and from different sectors to the topic of climate change.
On the other hand, "the negotiations can also be said to affect the freedom of others.
Test data reveal persistent racial differences
The federal book of qualifications last week on mathematical performance was a very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country's systems with better performance, the Qualifications Book has shown that fourth and eighth grade students have been at a faster pace over the last two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average score of the fourth-grade white students of the D.C. for the last two years grew from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), but their African American couples increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, lowering a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
During a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference that separated the fourth grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was introduced in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some District Education lawyers expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Director Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by looking after those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that advocates for education equity in the District.
I am not jumping for a difference of two or three points, said the member of the D.C. Council, Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, a critical contributor to Rhee's administration style, said that the message of the test scores is that the city's secondary schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect them.
But what concerns is that we are not spending the time or energy needed for our secondary schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, is training some teachers to use a new curriculum for reading, the Wilson Reading System, directed to students of the upper secondary and secondary levels, who did not dominate the early reading grounds in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of every day, a curriculum of mathematics from Kindergarten to sixth degree, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, to whom something is believed about the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students below the level, Rhee said.
Others say that the results of ENPE highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to reduce the difference.
Here is a sort of sloppy dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies scores of urban evidence.
The solution to conventional policy is to allocate its administrative resources and reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political impacts that are contrary to that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she is trying to catch up with the middle white and black class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now a Newark school supervisor, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference in performance is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with the union of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers to be an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of the future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, came down and walked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the ice-cream meadows.
Graciela's parents had only graduated from a secondary school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth grade students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the record costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of impressed guests than that of potential enthusiastic students.
Yes! This is where I will be! Graciela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?, said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the low proportion of teachers-students at school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh thing that children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you will go to university.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who leave high school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduated from university, a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's labour force.
Those who analyze higher performance say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to the university, especially if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children whose parents do not have experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is concluded that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latin students.
We have to think about providing a network of support for these children, from the kindergarten to secondary school.
The federal program funded by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run university preparatory programs, which start when low-income students are in high school and continue until high school is completed.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent attending university, according to the United States Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, during two substations that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a key role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, which has been mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have moved away as they have risen in only two of the 10 substations.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only one who presented an offer was lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for deposited deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq's Oil Forum, an online news centre.
It'll take a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military withdraws, probably prevented US oil companies from risking themselves more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third most important oil reserve, said analysts.
U.S. companies were in disadvantage in some cases because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc were the only US companies that reached agreements with the ministry.
The major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who have narrowed ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main deposits.
We know that China is about to become a major economic and technological power, as expressed by the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the side of its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each deposit.
The main planner of al Qaeda has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a alleged US missile attack on the Pakistani border with Afghanistan has killed a major operations planner of the Qaeda this week, US counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who were thought to have died on Tuesday when a couple of missiles hit their car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of Waziristan in the North, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said that missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car got the impact, a civil intelligence agency official from Pakistan said by phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner of the Qaeda, which led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, quoting the delicate nature of U.S. air attacks within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to Qaeda's superior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the ranks of the Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, said the second official.
If confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The rate of non-pilot attacks conducted by the CIA has decreased since summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a report from The Long War Journal, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to an improved approach by terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while deliberately killing suspected informants, the site said.
Maximum United Nations sent in Kabul to give up
The United Nations' highest envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending with an alarming mandate that had been damaged by widespread allegations of corruption in the UN-backed Afghanistan presidential election.
The Eide exit takes place when Obama has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but he was concerned that the US schedule for military withdrawal, which began in 18 months, moved other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide pointed out in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who cooperated with the political transition from Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said that he was not giving up, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission to Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peace missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested in front of his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's accusations, who was dismissed, "probably damaged the mission, because there was already much skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said that he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by United States-led forces in Afghanistan.
It also encouraged the leadership of the United Nations to allow its successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which are being lent to the Afghan mission, to increase its confidence in the correct use of its money.
Eide expressed its frustration at the limitations on its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the heavy United Nations recruitment regulations were undermining its ability to capture talents.
That is how the United Nations rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a one-week war zone trip in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, I supported, in response to a soldier's question about the probability of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned something from Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictableness of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and incentives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less secure with nuclear weapons", because "your people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "believable" consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would negotiate again on the restriction of his nuclear programme and would accept leaving a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel that was desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pressed for this agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and make time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have withdrawn itself from the attempted agreements, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian government is divided in relation to the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some of the proposals actually accepted in early October has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians.
President Obama has set the deadline on 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, even to continue with what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "depravating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what Thursday called "unfounded and lacking basic charges", by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said that it had the will to continue talks with the United States and other five world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was about to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Kurdish oil-rich region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and participation, remain high.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in United States projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by advertising posters that told them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "a baby but means another grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the elderly population of their city, suddenly changed their course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to a child.
We have nothing left for a second, Wang said, 31 years old, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old child.
More than 30 years after a single child's policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously ill-treated children, the only ill-treated children, affected by "small emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when politics became effective, according to the Division.
Population of the United Nations, while the number of residents aged 60 and over will be exploited from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2020 to 31.1. per cent by 2050, is much higher than the overall average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with very cultural populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, the 60-year-olds and more accounted for almost 22 per cent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, has stated that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the elderly population and alleviate a future shortage of work."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief
As drafted in the constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of a single China child is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced so far by the Communist Party.
The political partners face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have seized the policy by their contribution to avoid a critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually abandoned their position on the policy of a single child.
In 2004, they allowed for more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are unique children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Institute of Demographic Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost evening the morning, the cartels that ordered families to have one child, were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family and volunteer planning officials to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointment Response
Although the officials of a rural city outside Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples who wanted a second child after the campaign was launched, the most urban districts did not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
The disappointed Shangai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu family planning committee in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first son the best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the medical and life insurance that the government provides them.
Without a social protection network, they maintain, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West wrongly see the policy of a single child as a matter of rights, Yang said, an engineer of construction whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing our chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wanted a single child because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, owned by a translation agency, explained it more thoroughly.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, he said, it is a success enough to be selfish.
People aged between 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents fighting during the first days of China's experiment with capitalism and did not want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even one child takes a lot of time from parents, I did.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategy "should have a curriculum prepared for the best custody when the child is 9 months old."
Most of your friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A United Nations group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual re-criminations, renewed focus on Friday with the release of a document that provides for ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is going on indefinitely, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by an ad hoc working group of the United Nations, the text does not mention how much money the rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in temperature that political strategies would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process much flexibility, said John Coequiyt, High Representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page paper, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate officer Yvo de Boer described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks Friday, promising to provide $3,600 million a year over the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday presented the same kind of verbal artificial fires that dominated the conversations last week.
The United States special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected the claims that require mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared with those of the major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a harder line with China, with regard to what Bush administration officials did only two years ago.
The United States will not enter into an agreement without the major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the United States' highest climate negotiator lacked "common feeling", or was "very irresponsible" because he had said earlier this week that the United States would not help China economically to cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's leading powers at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the world in development, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that the main powers were discussing who should cost the costs of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, even when vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in seeking to contain the large emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, Ulate supported, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change from Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants said that the talks would produce at most a political agreement.
The Small Island Alliance, which has 43 members, developed a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand the action of emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency while delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues had to be resolved before the heads of government came to a close.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, went down from the planes and ran to the halls of the Bella Center, to meetings at closed doors and press conferences, in order to be able to limit the calls that will be held next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people every day enter and leave the convention centre, the guitar activists present night shows jokingly from the countries they think they are selling, and preliminary hand-to-hand proposals are being made instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues," said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President of the Global Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first 225 km train from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 p.m. on Monday morning, a sild will penetrate the darkness to mark a train exit that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The first high-speed interurban train in the country will reach 225 km, when it passes as a beam from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He hopes that the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major controversies of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected isolated areas would turn into suburban prosperity, business travel times would be cut short and the change of aircraft and railway cars would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fear of environmental damage, can still stop the high-speed lines of Britain.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will submit its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed route from the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radio in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will set three options for a higher-speed network that is heading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred option that is being proposed is a configuration in the form of Y, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Midlands of the West.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One line would enter Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first plot, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the few more than one hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel 402 km, converting the British network to Europe's fastest.
The initial route is being designed to support trains of 400 m long, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the restrictions on capital space, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
The experts in the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should be carried out, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is started, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines through the existing lanes to the north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
The contributors face the mortgage by an orange of £75.000 from a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the voter of the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange that he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison voice, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs were living "of rations", increased their mortgage by £75.000 to build an extension marked as a slave in their second house in Rutland.
The contributor was allowed to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds per month.
The authorities of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the costs of the members. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the applications could not be clearer or simpler.
Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-bedroom house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor included a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office of fees agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "narangal".
The neighbors described it as "a winterhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee dismissed him from violating the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds from his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
The documents circulated this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1,400 monthly pounds in mortgage interests until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
The type of interest of the mortgage of the Royal Bank of Scotland of Mr. Duncan did not change at that time, suggesting that all the increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the rate that it is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for £1.250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying that the MPs had to survive "rations" after the cost scandal.
" Basically this is nationalized, you have to live with rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I spend my money in my garden and I ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask a lot more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former occupation as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the symbol of the sterling pound on Mr. Duncan's lawn as a protest, after revealing that he had applied for 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved by both the salary office and later by Legge."
He added: "It is not about avoiding and criminalizing or infringing the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Adventure of Brighton Beach
Brighton palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive adventure calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for every December day, using villas as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with pastel filled and served free.
The elected villars so far include Vi Three Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palate presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant at Hove, is a non-remunerated minister of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society."
"Why do we as Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Palapa Adventure calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in the call for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested several hundred people.
Approximately thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, showed off on the Danish capital ice in a claim to an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization of the climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the very high "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents erupted shortly after the beginning of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke escapes with adoquines and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturb police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to it, particularly members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinctions", stressing that a hundred of them were "immobilized on the street on Saturday night married and sitting in spite of intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peacefully, came out of Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the headquarters of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a guard with candles.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial shellfish responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue sea" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a militant Filipino of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.
We can't keep saying: there's time, said the singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa there are rivers that dry, watercourses that can be walked as never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight against the world."
The Pacific Asia region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial milestone to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, displayed reddish clothes and shining gowns with slogans for solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were formed who claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Georgian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5:00 p.m.
According to the heads of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, participation was 58 per cent a few hours before closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the vote poll.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili said, "I am sorry that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considered it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, told the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted in Bagapch.
She was among the voters who addressed the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with subsisting landscapes on the Black Sea coast.
Large tables show Bagapch next to the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the poll.
In a short ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, thank the support of Moscow, and in particular, the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered by lifting his vodka vessel.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of low-cost railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organised two weeks later.
Climate: World events, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change, where the police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an impressive demonstration.
Approximately thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, were paraded in the afternoon in the middle of the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes up to 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The demonstration, quite peacefully, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a guard with candles.
A few minutes after the beginning of the event, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke loose with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disquieting police surrounded them quickly and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the mandible with an adoquin, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to arresting some 20 people, according to the police.
We do not remove the eyes of the extremist groups above, preventing police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most with celestial shellfish responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of Earth to form "blue sea" for "justice and climate".
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, Lidy Nacpil, a militant Filipino of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen explained.

French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight against the world."
The Oxfam organization along with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Pacific Asia region, which brings together many islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial milestone to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went out to the street in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, in most of their students, showed red clothes and shining signs with slogans for solar energy in front of the Philippine Capital City.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters claimed to act against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
The allocation of history and geography is strengthened by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be transmitted in the Informative of Sunday (JDD, according to his French stamp) that history and geography would emerge "fortalecids" of the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelorhood.
From now on, every student in the first bachelor's class will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "just with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "generally, it calls for the best students."
The General and Literary Education branches cannot be subbrames of the C, it continues: "Neither have I heard that historians or intellectuals were angry that they had eliminated history and geography in second degree in the technological schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven French of ten (69%) rejected the government's project to eliminate the mandatory teaching of history-geographics in second degree B. Many intellectual and teachers, the left and some right elected representatives also criticized this fact.
On the other hand, the Minister added that "not spoken" would eliminate the philosophy of the second baccillerate programme C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teaching training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called on a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they said sacrificed the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will deliver an admission test aimed at discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will practice in real terms during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the class as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the class, that is, more than 300 hours, added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to delete the school map "before 2012".
In the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain in a convincing way the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, I dare you to accept on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the round of "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of presentations by experts of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, informed an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracts and conveys people's desire to know more, he explained in the framework of the Edouard Hannezzo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish in the school pond.
We chose twenty participants among the experts of his discipline and selected them on his charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who explained without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public understands that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier".
The videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: Disgusting among prison guards, action is planned
The prison guards' unions called on Friday to "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year's holidays, the prizes and extra hours, which was postponed until budgetary reasons were reached.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guard Union) asked the outside staff to join the event on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block them" to report the theft of their estates.
The Penitentiary CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them "to meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve massive mobilization", for he said that the failure to pay in December of the "extra hours, nights, Sundays and festive days" worked in October.
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Union of Penitentiaries (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the security unions ensuring that the payment would be made in the coming month.
No doubt about the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to implement immediately a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours did not occur again in the future.
The December payment will then be limited, except for the management staff who enjoys the benefit of the famous awards for functions and objectives, and who "always blames the budgetary requirements," said Ufap/Ussa.
It is a real scandal, he said indignantly the interregional association FO of Marseille, announcing his decision to boycott to the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, also a threat to FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking more effective action, it is more than regretful to turn to attacking staff salaries, she appreciates the Burdeos prison CGT.
According to the unions, not in all regions the same happens, because some are happier than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected one, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than those who receive
US President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion regarding gifts: "I make better gifts than I get."
During a special interview that the ABC chain will issue on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little partner of four legs of the family, will be from the game.
Father Noel also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the extracts of the program transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's statements about the quality of gifts she received: "No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts," he said.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding with humour pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?"
During an hour's interview, in an atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devoted himself to Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts of the child.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball balloon that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball ball, the President said.
Only many years later, I realized that he had given me that balloon.
On the other hand, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
He had no idea how to organize a house, then he put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of staying around the house, however, he loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in an inducted coma
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles due to important "damages" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his claims, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital where some doctors checked "derivative injuries from the operation" of discal hernia performed in Paris on 26 November, pointing out his press service in that same city, indicating that such injuries "needed a repair operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace by saying that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical unit would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last turn, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, to be subjected to a coma induced to avoid "pains and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we'll have more certainty about his condition, add RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" he would not have been introduced to any channel after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a discal hernia.
The intervention, programmed a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information provided by RTL.
The singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sinaï Los Angeles hospital on Monday for an infection resulting from the intervention by Delajoux.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained on Thursday in RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but he made sure there was no "no problem" because the rocker was "a fighter".
He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a fool to do twelve hours after such an operation, it's not possible, said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to calm down saying that Johnny Hallyday "responsibly reacted to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laetcia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days as a result of a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, for a general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed having been operated with a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as expected, his long "Royal 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been reported excessively. Fanatics and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the musician to move on stage.
By mid-November, their followers had even had to deny a new admission.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet at its favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist in the World-2009 long pool, obtained an international title on Thursday at a distance where he feels particularly affected, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which the polyurethane bathers were last allowed, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A punishment for Bousquet, who was jealous of the world record in 50 m free, is a large pool brand (20.94).
In one of the two kings of the swimming, 50 m free, the 28-year-old French was charged with 20'53 during an end where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international prize.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was at my disposal, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane baths and from 1 January will be banned.
These bathers, from 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epoch in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of the bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a long pool this summer in Rome, successive world records.
The young swimmer did not reach its mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in this race.
I knew this time I was not going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and carry out my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold in USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold on Thursday at $1.5 million, much above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art market.
This two-metre panel of 63 cm high, dated the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionisian scenes, in an architectural framework sophisticated, surrounded by satires and Jewish women, is a rare piece, since in the world there are only four or five", explained AFP Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt in Sotheby's.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest by the buyers, without a doubt, pointed out to the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abnerthy.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathtub in his particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Colonel Petin took power.
For some fifty years, his residence was uncertain.
Revising the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an open Emile Zola succession in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborts Zelaya’s Exit to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico felt that the conditions were not given to move to its territory to the defeated president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the Golpista government denied the safe conduct.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The plane of the Mexican government that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take it to Zelaya returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
To grant him a safe conduct, the Golpist government wanted Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the defeated president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as the head of state in the invited exercise.
The coupist government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to give up my position (...), they wanted me to give up," Zelaya said on Thursday to radio Globo, in which he often made statements since the beginning of the political crisis that took five months in Central America.
Here I can stay for ten years, I have my guitar, added by playing agreements with the deposed president, who has been refugees in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassies submitted us a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because they did not contain asylum applications, the Interior Minister of the Golpista Government, Oscar Raúl Matute, said on Wednesday at Honduran Radio HRN.
I will not ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview in the Telesur chain, whose headquarters is located in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I'll do it as president of the Hondurasn people, he stressed.
The rumors about Zelaya's match mobilized Wednesday to the supporters of the deposed president, who met around the Brazilian embassy, strongly located by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Golpista government.
This reflects the marginal character of this government in relation to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was defeated on 28 June, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he goes, he will be arrested and must answer to the Court for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup d'état.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress massed against Zelaya's return to power until its mandate was completed on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, US trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67%; and Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190,06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1.102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piezza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he made it clear, considering that the market was concentrated "in the middle full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6 per cent in October, compared with September, to $32,900 million.
On the contrary, analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, Christopher Cornell, of the research company Economy.com said.
On the contrary, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But in the course of the last four weeks, the average of the number of new jobseekers "was the lowest a year ago", said Scott Marcoouller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year-old cash return rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night, and the 30-year-old bonus rose to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on Tuesday.
Cuba: More than a hundred power supporters take advantage of the "White Ladies"
This Thursday, hundreds of Cuban power supporters bled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on the world day of human rights and prevented another demonstration to which a decade of dissidents were summoned.
Forty "Lamas de Blanco", wives or family members of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of the Raúl Castro government as they walked to the centre of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, a journalist from the AFP supported.
The Yankees died!, "Mercenaria!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raúl!"corregated with the fist at the top of the power militants to dissidents.
The latter were heard by civil-dressed agents who came to "protect them."
On Friday, a similar event was launched against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanero district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to manifest themselves on Thursday for the international human rights day, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, a journalist from the AFP reported.
The agents forced the vehicles to dissidents who were pulled by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances takes only a few hours.
The "White Ladies", won with the Sajarov Prize 2005 awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "seek the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissidentity, said one of his leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom follow the lines.
The Cuban authorities target the opponents of "mercenaires" or "agents" at the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on the demonstration of Thursday by government militants against the "revolutionaries".
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of pausing rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An octogenary alien killer with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) on Thursday at the time of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elder, in the pharmacy or in front of him in No. 85 of the Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, reported police and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a director of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, was interned and injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were transferred to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wound, with the apparently affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a disappointment and was hospitalized "in a state of shock", reported a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped from the boulvar Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more feet: one 30-year-old man, and one 40-year-old seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unexplained.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was carrying across the back, an officer of the Alliance union in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé explained.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to the evidence obtained by the AFP.
I've seen a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, he explained Alberto, the mayor of a nearby bar.
A crowd was thrown over him, among them a police officer who broke the doll, added.
By bubbling Jean-Jaurès, at the time of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured by gunshots, according to the police testimony.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many trades.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I felt a very important injury in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office conducted the investigation into the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Senior Judicial Police of the Senate (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
There is no such word during his provisional detention.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of hospitalizing him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him in the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overexcited" as "every disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action".
US: Polanski's lawyer again asks that the case be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case was dismissed against his client, who was under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer from the director of "El Pianista", denounced three judges from the California Second District Appeals Chamber for serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel said: I claim that the charges are being dismissed at this time, since the judge's conduct in the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "suffered".
According to him, Judge Rittenband (lost since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before giving sentence, which constitutes a serious procedural failure.
This conversation was published in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the prosecutor's mouth in question, David Wells.
But then, at the end of September, Wells declared "have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejected the judgment.
The accusation, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, that there could be no serious assessment of the destabilization of the charges as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down by "illegal sexual relations" with a younger than 13 years old.
Since then, he has never walked the United States again.
The Deputy District Attorney of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "should be here to appear in the audience".
For this reason, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing?, Asayama asked.
To her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor in court, even though he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He argues that his client no longer supports her every time the Polanski case comes up, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by order of North American arrest.
After more than two months after the riots, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street loses direction and stops for the dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday, in a market that is discussed between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the definitive figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average raised 65.67 points reaching 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to be located in 2,190,31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management pointed out.
It stays with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it's going to keep it that way until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained through the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve market opinion regarding the robustness of economic reactivation", analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November by a second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, the confidence of US consumers was clearly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 66.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were hampered by a new advance in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months compared to the euro, which "has led to lower sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Treasury grant rose to 3,540 per cent compared to 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night, and the 30-year-old bonus to 4,497 per cent compared to 4,492 per cent on Tuesday.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World's title are in the final line to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of billions of spectators.
During this great celebration of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportist or, even, Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real revelation.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I've seen so many things and I've lived countless experiences!' said surprised Miss Sierra Leone.
This nine-time event in South Africa will be broadcast live Saturday from Midrand to northern Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 h GMT).
It's impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm very glad I've flown twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Australian summer.
For young Russians, their second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the possibility of discovering again "African countries that take their breath off".
After a month of galas, tests, press and safaris, the candidates to Miss World focus on the race.
India Poja Chopra expects to be able to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted into Bollywood stars.
The dream of all women is to be crowned as the most beautiful of the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to go back to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will show off with traditional clothes and, of course, with a bathrobe.
The Chinese presenter Angela Chow, the former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a director of the Miss Mundo committee, Steve Douglas, will lead the event.
South Africa has proved to be able to receive the world with warmth and pride difficult to equal, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous Township of Soweto, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who reached out to them.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
Your best memory will undoubtedly be the city of Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Football, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I've never thought to get to know.
Probably back to the world in 2010, says excited Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport to accompany his hospitalized father several days ago.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, he told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him off Paris shortly after 1 p.m. (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, disengaged, assured him that he would move "as before" to the Cedars-Sinaï Los Angeles hospital, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection resulting from the discal hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "as induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service indicated.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï de Los Angeles hospital, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a discal hernia operation on 26 November last in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night on Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laettia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attended to attend a school act, confirmed a photographer from the AFP.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the Pitie-Salpétrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26 at the international private clinic in Parque Monceau, Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were angry, Camus said.
It's about a possible claim, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor, and he surprised me when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, because I was operated twice on disk hernia, he added.
Shortly before in the RTL station, he indicated that the singer seemed to have gone "no channel, no nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
She operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, he also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed by a brain hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by justice on several occasions by malpractice, as well as by tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, an attorney for the Medical Order, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" claimed "on a regular basis" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the post-operative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Anyway, the singer's turn, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, came into parenthesis.
No doubt to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Centre about the use of its seal
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the seal of the former Giscardist party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, his regret being claimed.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the UDF seal, as he considered that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after he had held his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
As a support for its management, he received the help of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it at the National Industrial Property Institute in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association office, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and to the MP, urging them to give up the seal and transfer the rights of the brand to them, their punishment for judicial action.
In recent days, you have made many statements suggesting that you would propose your political movement to regain the UDF seal, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +Nouveau center+, and the slogan +l'UDF of today's+ in its militant material and on the site's presentation page, they support the signatories of the letter.
As they already know, they have no right to use the seal, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to remove "the name of the UDF from all support, as well as from (their) Internet site".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to the legitimate rightholders".
If not, justice will be called upon to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "elected" to go in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the UDF seal.
They also remember that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continue the office, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF three years ago", but a member of the UMP.
It scandalously and fraudulently exploits the absence of registration of the UDF acronym to carry out it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they report, before they joke about the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worth making their own name than trying to get out of anonymity by taking a name that is not right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Nanterre Court decided to refer the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as said by the daughter of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt, she took advantage of the weakness of the octogenary to expose her to some of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence is a maximum of three years imprisonment and EUR 375,000 fine.
This means that in this case there will be a worthy process of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter dispute the returns of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal.
But the Correctional Tribunal No. 15 also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years of age, be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's successor and principal shareholder always refused to submit to such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday should submit a report before 10 March 2010 indicating whether Liliane Bettencourt has suffered from weakness and for what period.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said when she left the audience.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older woman, whom we must protect, said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter started criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for years to get billions of euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, whom she considered a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers ' allegations resulted in, on occasion, a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was mistrusting Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
From his wedding, I could never speak to Françoise again."
On the other hand, the Nanterre Prosecutor once again considered that the applicant was not in a position to appear, as much as a guard judge refused, in these last days, to take place at his request to open a court proceedings for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under custody and has no guardian.
No one else can appear in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the representative of the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be given once.
Management Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that employees adhere to "values" determined from above as previously it was to impose on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer in the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially R&D and, more importantly, business intelligence.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) "is demanding that all involved (...) have proactive conduct and a prospective view"; it requires employees to make a commitment that is fully opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the Orange questionnaire among their employees, encourage the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the directors have a simpler view of human behavior.
As they come from large engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanically.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that American "neurosciences" have recently reactivated, and that the Studies Institutes and the media have widely spread to their back.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "sic" commands of the executive's commitment, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directors in a mechanicalist management position, inadequate to today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution needed for the proper functioning of modern companies is to adopt a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of making reality part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motifunional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a default doll that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the mobilization factors, corporate directors can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and re-establish human resources management "in place".
In this way, they create a favourable area for organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: by the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the North American right, is pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, he hailed Obama's speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had denied the award to Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I was delighted with what she said, said Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right wing of the Republican party to the U.S. newspaper Today, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memories.
In my opinion, war is, from then on, the last thing North Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, this Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered the president to have done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, and the former President of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in Presidential words.
For the moment, the talk seemed very historical to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider to be a potential candidate for Republican investment for the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear "a President of the Left" when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free or could be awarded a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler at Washington Post, Obama said "a very North American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as "a citizen of the world", as "always does", "talked as a North American president" by reminding Europeans "who live in a security bubble that they didn't create and don't do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wings, a Bush era halkon, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech of "monotonous, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the website of the National Review Online.
To the left of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the press on the left praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama had received the Nobel in advance, described his speech as "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression", the Californian newspaper said excitedly.
Obama "prepared the necessary speech," said the New York Times, judging it "at the same time as the shadow and the building.
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiations, road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patron organization that remained until the end of the day, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement ending the strike and the threat of Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Transport Secretary, Dominique Bussereau, was "enjoyed" by the agreement, after several negotiation sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired at the dawn of Friday with the hope of quickly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even though three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) withdrew by giving a doorway.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for all to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "was very harmful to businesses" and "was afraid to disturb the parties at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4 per cent for the lowest wages (on local and regional road transport) and 2.9 per cent for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate is 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
Not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, said Patricia Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there are no more cuts or blockades in the supply centres.
But there can always be some rebel discontinuance, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that it was "a good agreement", although it was "hard to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects the employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel costs of 3 per cent and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will, above all, address the subject of an extraordinary pay and modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a discount of EUR 100 million in master's fees" was the subject of an amendment by the government in the draft amending finance bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms".
The TLF signature enables the agreement to be applied firstly to companies affiliated to this organization and secondly to all professions, if the Minister of Labour extends.
It will be done "as soon as possible", said Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR complained that it was a "ingenuity business", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat straw at the next Nochebuena dinner, Unostra was regretted.
For the OTHER, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: Conflicts during the weekend, trade unions disagree with RATP's proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, because in Friday's meeting, on the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for a premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., due to one train of each two on the central track (between La Defense and Nation) and one train of each four on the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change by train.
The Lafayette Gallery, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP is trying to provide services to large shops".
The RER A cross from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP route runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in each of the two trains circled in peak hours, and almost no train in the valley hours, as expected.
There was no disturbance on Thursday in the Andeans thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less competitive than normal, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time".
Saint-Lazare Station was not saturated, SNCF indicated, which had foreseen the supervision of police and police forces.
The RERs operated by the SNCF from or destined to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or participated in the Saint-Lazare station to join the metro.
New general meetings of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfying" according to the trade unions, of a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its proposals of primacy between parenthesis, the CGT said angry, pointing out that the direction "was unable to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP said.
What also led the unions to say that the company "does not care about the end of the week".
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee headquarters in Paris.
Then the direction, which was refused until then to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents had submitted a warning.
Trade unions are asking for a premium of EUR 120 (Usa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line with a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the procuring party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main procuring party, a decision that immediately provoked wrath in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the government's task, which had just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that were detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", President Hasim Killić of the Court told the press after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were required to obtain the resolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, are members of political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity from which Turk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before they were parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalczynkaya, in 2007, who accuses DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the Tribunal takes place at a time when the government holds hands to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the Kurds no longer support the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a resolution could generate a surge in tensions in Southeast anatomy, where a large number of demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan's arrest conditions had degenerate in police clashes over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have met at DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great care of the Southeast population in most of them by Kurds.
The Forces of the Order threw tearstones and used water cannons, while the protesters launched Molotov bombs or stones with honks.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk said that the decision of justice was going to "deepen the disillusionment".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by resolving a party, it said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
At first we oppose the closure of the parties.
So nothing resolves, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in recent months.
Snowflakes can start suddenly
A really fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the Director of Road Management in the winter of the FES.
But with this, your employees can learn to test and dominate the entire vehicle technology.
Maybe at the end of the week meteorologists announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and the temperatures fall below zero degrees, they leave 20 of the so-called A trams with large vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
For example, the main arteries and avenues such as the New Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also the access to the body of bombers, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and hangings, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three o'clock in the morning
It shall cover approximately 1,040 kilometres, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which will be added better.
That's why the FES starts about three o'clock in the morning, "with this the roads are free until the traffic is over."
The difficult thing is when it starts to snow around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the road maintenance director in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salt vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, which also belong to Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is lateral and secondary streets.
That's where trouble is generated, you know Brauburger.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly through dangerous and cross-cutting points.
In general, the ESF could not take charge of all bicycles.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which does not lose sight of the bridges from 22 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become resbalades, the salt vehicle starts to run as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In the event of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The Dinosaur’s cuneiform
The Tawa found the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 150 meters high that ran on the two strong back legs, had a long head with sharp teeth and curves, short arms with hips and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa findae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the Pangea supercontinent in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us much about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists launched an excavation in 2006 in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triásico sediments, reports Randall Irmis member of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were gathered together.
A finding confirms the theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "The triásico dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share all this enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of Bonn University.
According to the current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the mice were divided into their three most important genealogical lines: carnivorous teropodes among those found in Tyronasaurus Rex, Velociroptor and also birds, quadruped saropodes known as "long neck" and their relatives, and Ornithischia herbivorous (bird pelvis-sauries), to which they belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and his colleagues, Tawa finds it to be a primitive teropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt comments.
For example, in the Tawa skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those also owned by the descendants of the teropods, birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the spine were obviously partly filled with air.
Tawa is the theropod with older and primitive air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Because the parent line of the later giant mushrooms also had air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers have found that the mice came up there for the first time.
Consequently, the three genealogical lines separated at one start and extended from South America through all the corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a single earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa the remains of two other not closely related teropods.
The three cannot descend from a single parented predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three migratory waves were given to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in current Poland, says paleontologist Bonn Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because in South America many dinosaur fossils are simply still preserved, while in other continents there is only one thing to discover.
The question of how the dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare lateral line of reptiles to the dominant land vertebrades of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
In the Triásico, dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other mice.
By the end of the Triásico the dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while the relative was extinct at the edge of the Triásico towards the Jurásico.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a massive extinction to which the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competitors in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteorite slows the growth of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triásico and since then carried a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt has affected the world.
278 professors and cathedrals at Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarityed with the students in protest at the Campus de Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the governing board.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, expelled last week the building occupied by students and teachers in an educational strike because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
Material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and cathedrals by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served as "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracted the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, they say.
Protest legitimized
Young people from the Green Union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also work together with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, says the National Youth Secretary of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the action of the head of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the principal of the university.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said on Thursday in the Parliament of the Wiesbaden province.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, Peter Beuth, a representative of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Green and the Left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of carefully studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are excluded.
The Left has submitted a motion in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a site heavily guarded for the secret investigation of weapons.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered to be the Russian "Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centres for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have been in contact with the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Narrow Cooperation Protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Seligrado, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the Chief of Planning Services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Centre for Natural Sciences Research.
Scientific Exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will be able to set a foot on the growing Russian market.
In exchange, Russian scientific firms want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the major Consortiums of Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") received its name from the landscape of forested mountains, where research facilities were established.
Stuttgart brakes
Stuttgart's dimension 21 is not set for anything high enough.
For the project's supporters, it is simply a "new heart of Europe".
The law is. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will rush to the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region for a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which ended in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes for modern rail traffic, as a huge amount of time was needed in the past to get the locomotives back forward.
Rotate, stop in the dry continue the journey; but that's how it should be done.
And that's why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passage station, which is located about half of the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; from there it is the slogan of "Europe's Heart".
The S21 will really be launched, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost impermissible to implement the reduction.
Of course, railway terminals also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's car on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new frame built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have done so.
The railway continues, too, because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects in the Republic are borne by the contributor rather than by the State.
From a urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
A new urban space is created, with many green areas, probably of the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of persons, which was attributed to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first take care to strengthen the transport of goods, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new construction structures are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing on other narrow crossings and crossings on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the slow-step track has been built.
It would be urgent here to walk the accelerator as it is due.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley will be the bottle neck for international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the Wiesbaden autonomous parliament if it is to bring an appeal against the Hesse administrative court's night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the VGH judgement of more than 400 pages, according to the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had based in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the northwest landing track planned at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide by 4 January, whether it will bring an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and pressured government representatives to give up appeal before the Administrative Court of the Nation in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, the head of the green Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We fulfill our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's re-crimination, which the federal government would be trying to achieve by means of law-trafficking and tricks, even though it still had its night flights.
Extensive legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition did not want to act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally unaffected decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition stands, his group's claims on the night air traffic ban would never have been.
The U.S. banks repay the aid granted.
The large US banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state powers.
The Bank of America has once again returned the aid granted to it by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately EUR 30 billion).
The Citi Group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by the United States CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had achieved about 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had many means, among other things for the sale of items.
Banking Director Kenneth Lewis thanked US taxpayers on Wednesday especially: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank into the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to make money on the capital market in order to be able to get rid of its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported on a source of known circles, which the US bank could already announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
In the end, everything was faster than it was thought.
Only two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) press the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present itself to a successor.
Last night the gregium wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main study of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this on the part of the station, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm the Director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not also be approved in the Administrative Council.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet reached at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the administrative board with his proposal to renew the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's resignation was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a possible failure.
Because the majority of the Union in the Administrative Council had indicated weeks before the election that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition to the editor had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious editor with the argument that under the direction of Brender, ZDF information would have lost hearing indices.
Shortly before the elections, there were protests because of this, in which he beat the political influence on the ZDF.
At the end of the debate, 35 experts in public law had become involved, who had described the Koch process as unconstitutional.
But it didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Roman politics, pedagogy and philology.
He then worked on the Southwest Funk station and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 he changed for the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" newsletter.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 Deputy Chief of Staff; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Director and Head of the morning program "Morgenmagazines"; until 2001 Director of the Foreign Policy of the ZDF; since then Director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional claim after Brender's resignation, which was still elected this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative board, the president of the government of Renania-Palatinate, explained last week that the federations should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the Director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A withdrawal of party politicians from ZDF control bodies was discarded by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, was recommended to the administrative board with an intelligent play: he strongly criticized Brender's resignation.
Thanks to this test of journalism independence, both Schächter could appoint him for the post of editor without losing face, as the administrative council could vote, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a successor.
In the calculations of the Frey parties is awarded in all ways to the liberals on the left.
The university careers are cleared
A partial success for students: after a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally gave up. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the case of licensing and mastering.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically, each module of the career should end with a single review.
In addition, students are expected to be charged with work, and they want to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of results of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states commit themselves to making the structural rules together more flexible for Bachelor and Master's careers.
Regulations of the federal states that differ from this should no longer exist.
Less Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers for Education and Culture and the heads of universities have been talking about improving their ability to carry out and successfully complete a career (studyability).
For the first time, a specific content was discussed.
The so-called Accreditation Council agreed to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module ends with a single examination", says a 30-page document, which aims to regulate partially the approval of university careers.
The "sensitive reduction in the burden of examination" aims to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the Director of the Accreditation Board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, "studiability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be examined in detail with regard to unnecessary restrictions on students in the choice of.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to more space, enabling and promoting their own initiative".
These rules would prevail for new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These should be "reaccredited" again every five years, but this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all the races.
This would include 10 accreditation agencies across the country, under the supervision of the Accreditation Council, which is established by the federation States.
Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federations in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of materials and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far, only Renania-Platinada has ensured that additional resources are provided for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student tutoring and counselling programmes, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The federal state and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wanted to bring Parliament a novelty of university law.
According to it, there should be only one examination for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, and it is also desirable to ensure recognition of evaluations at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master.
Until the end of the year that follows, it is intended to examine all the careers about its "studiability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
In addition to the praise, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the federal board of directives of the Juso (socialist youth) university groups, the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "three closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the strikes of education, students as the main stakeholders should be able to see the same.
The president of the Board of University Directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: "We need students' experience," said Thursday in a meeting with the Education Ministers, with whom HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) Bonn agreements were not at all sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the title of Bachelor to access a subsequent Master's career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough studios for Master in the future with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to find a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a note at the foot about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrollable," says the first line of a poem by Werner Söllner in unbalanced linguistic fragments, where he discusses the experiences of arrival to Germany experienced by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English professor in Bucharest, and then as a reader in an editorial of children's books, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several awards of literature, in 1993 he taught memorable lectures or poetry talks at the University of Goethe, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said to talk enough last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his security records"
Apparently insecure and ashamed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted his participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Security vis-à-vis colleagues German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly in early 1971.
"That's why I'm someone who didn't defend enough in the face of the attempts to provoke security fear," Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and his unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania are being shaken by a case that demonstrates the abysses and evil of a political system, which is based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, therefore, known so far, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his I.M. Security case, Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the influence for him of the positive I.M. Walter.
He had excused him or defended him at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
Söllner's statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Security-Spitzel wesen, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the "Time" weekly after reading her own 914 pages.
Involved will probably have speculated and have in some cases known what names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and also Walter's seudonyms.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the management of the security control files is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been seen boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A National Council for the Clearance of Records of Security (CNSAS) for the Birthler Authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the records has been better tracked since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law governing the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Security of Temesvar spoke deplorably of the decoration.
"She's got psychosis," at the end they only asked her once.
The impatience of power seemed to be unturned in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent guilt.
Why right now? Who was hurt? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be more governed by the anxieties of knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genius of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, is more than just a note at the foot.
The League of Champions as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart’s VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team’s supplier, approached a Class C Mercedes taxi a quarter hour after midnight, giving the impression that an elegantly dressed external service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports item manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the Calva characteristic had hired a driver, because he still didn't know the city.
Furthermore, he could also drive the car himself: in the end, he had no alcohol at stake, and he was not drunk with joy the 55-year-old.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow it would start again.
I'd start it for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired only three days earlier: "It is true that we have reached the eighth end," that is, in the League of Champions, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against the Urziceni Union, Romania, "we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "a lot more important job" was waiting for them the following Sunday, he said.
Then it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sort
The eighth final of the Champions League (going on 16/17 and 23/24 February/ref. 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy was kept limited by the glorious entrance of the successor of Babel.
Not only in the so-called savior, who had soon inspired Stuttgart's inconsistencies in himself, willingness to surrender and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and I told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the Gross soul repairer his recipe of success that so simple sounds, but that with the Babbel therapist had no effect.
He displayed some magic, accepted Babbel's champion Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a few weeks' break due to an injury, progressed rapidly until he became the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon perceived with the Provial "fresh wind" and the way to work of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes deeply, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what was obviously missing when Babbel was.
The VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the test yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs more than anything.
Like Gross, players and administrators also refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relief and completely reliant on Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Levekusen with 0:4 had arrived the sad wake, Khedira thought.
And director Horst Heldt warned that although a target of the season had been achieved, the other was still very far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt did not wish to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after his first victory at his headquarters three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which were again updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had granted porter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had denounced weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change as a coach because of the pressure of teenage fanatics.
Also that his day off after the games had been removed he described Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said, and announced consequences for the latter.
They will probably no longer be friends forever, the two quarters.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without previous efforts with the team of the replaced coach, the show of great game and battle might not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important share in success", said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and he also agreed to the man in the plastic bag.
Pile of the world heavyweight championship
Burnishing pain in Bern: once again, the Kevin Johnsonn challenger was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title in the WBC version.
The judges' judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains the world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC Association won on Friday night in Bern to the US Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the nobility that everyone had expected could not be achieved.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 triumphs in 41 professional fights, twice he had to win because of his injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Berna Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters lower, who had proclaimed before the duel the end of the Klitschko era, was once again excavating from the world champion's beatings, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous left goal.
In general, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and he only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie" who "can't do anything".
In carrying out the weight, the champion was allowed on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth triumph after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he won the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without fighting.
That year he later won the title in his defenses to Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September to Chris Areola from the United States.
In this fight I only got a hit, and I am in a very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko's quick return to the ring.
But your dream is still bringing together all four important titles in your family.
His brother Vladimir is a world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to British David Haye, after it destroyed Nikolai Valujev in November of 2,13 metres.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a battle against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Apparently, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack on the opposition: the leader of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, lied to the Minister of Defence, Gutenberg, because of false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – After the most recent revelations about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of having misled with knowledge of cause.
On Saturday's "Tagesschau" broadcast, broadcast by the ARD television channel, Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin said that the minister "has not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said that he lied.
The killing order would have been issued without taking into account the rules of the International Defence Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was reported that in this attack it was not only a matter of destroying stolen trucks, but also of deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
In the United States air attack, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people died or were injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy, and whether the Chancellor, the Army and the Information Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancellor did not exercise any influence over concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday they had also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds of dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, they had both informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two high-ranking officials, they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a field patrol report.
In the meantime, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not manifest itself on Saturday with regard to the accusations made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which will be held next Wednesday.
Homely Worlds
In a state of surveillance, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug addicts do the limits between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give ourselves without obstacles to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience conditions similar to those of sleep during surveillance, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are most often viewed in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mental or drug addicts.
The fault is our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, sometimes divide the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
The informed state of consciousness that has been officially modified can appear in the most diverse ways, in the best of cases we call visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although triggerers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychodelical experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castanéda, the states of chamanic possession, and the psychosis and hallucinations.
Allusions or deliriums arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been removed – especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine – and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of state-of-the-art state dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 he found a "great similarity of state-of-the-art madness with the state-of-the-art", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the dispropositives, assigned formations, and speciesisms of it".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Its body is of two dimensions and scandalous color.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red mucous membranes like blood, deformed, brushing their teeth.
They're chasing him, they're kicking him with heavy and flaming boots, they're throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Stirred and malignant voices emerge from the walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. initiates two stereo cables, fastens them to form a knot of aortics, and fastens them on a hook on the ceiling.
It goes up into a box and puts the nude around the neck.
Jump.
The rope's coming down.
What a lesson for you!, yell at the voices in a choir that brings back the boys, "Go to the clinic and get healed!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of the product was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, it is also maniaco-depressive, it takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible distress and the deepest despair, he says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the times the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inner world, and fall into a state of overexcited which can lead to hallucinations, deliriums of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens its doors to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality of psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the General Psychiatry Clinic of Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the events, everything has a meaning towards it.
At the same time it comes into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
I've experienced a hallucination once in my life
On the contrary, in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle such."
Paranoia and hallucinations are based on reality, the distance from experience takes place in reality.
For the researchers, it's still an incognito why our brain makes cockroaches.
According to Fuchs, state of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality temporarily.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that there are other determinants in addition to genes.
Researchers assume that the affected suffers from minimal brain damage.
We suspect that brain maturation is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it is still an incognito how this change in the neuronal system occurs, which is not shown at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience can be the detonators of a psychosis when there is already a prior arrangement.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain's transmission system.
When the brain warms
The logic of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
To perceive a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in Werkem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Head), published last year.
Allusions are among the typical symptoms accompanied by psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
Among them are psychotic disorders such as personality or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and craneoencephalic trauma.
in a surprising way and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are usually suppressed.
They occur when the brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are not stored; when our brain is heated, but also when there are no stimuli.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and going to a college of secondary education.
A regular girl.
If it wasn't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, a boy has long and dark hair torpedoes the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit strange, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She wakes up and she sees and listens to that girl, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting in the bank next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and they disappear.
At night, appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When you are in class sometimes you cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, you don't know whether it's awake or dreaming, if the images you see, the mouse or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell him anything, they'd think he was crazy.
October 2009. Sarah K. She's 20 years old today.
He approved selectivity last year and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since you got in touch with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, he knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is responsible for finding entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he realized that the man he calls Dad since he has the use of reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real and noisy impressions, those affected like Sarah K. It is difficult for them to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "has a place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also categorizes night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends that your patients appreciate your hallucinations as a special skill.
Limitation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on consciousness, imaginative experiences tend to be pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor of Heidelberg and doctor chief of the clinic of psychiatric and psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Onyric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers them real and that can no longer differ from being awake.
Onyric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropathia, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewustsein eine motorische Lähmung suffer.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of one or the world because of a total and permanent motor failure, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by a self- and imaginary world that is disconnected from reality.
A way of limiting the situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to an invulnerable situation in itself that our own capacity to create enables us not to sink into anything of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, also describes his iniquitous experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of soul saving.
He was 49 years old when his conscience set sail on several days after an operation of heart valves including heart transplant, while his body was condemned to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen dived into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was laid in bed, a bigger man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching for his health.
He was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with fiery snow and met with a mafia Korean.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile it is to reproduce the inner reality of external reality, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "may lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
Children will take charge of the editorial at 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
Both children become heirs at 27 years of age and have the firm's will to enter the company, Burda, 69 years of age, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been adjusted as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they're trained for it.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of their children, if they are not trained enough to do so.
That would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that she would withdraw from the chairmanship of the Board of Directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen had been appointed her successor.
This member of the Kallen family, of 52, has been a member of the Burda Directorate since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
Later, he took care of the treasure and thus came to responsibility for the company's heritage. After Jürgen Todenhöfer's release, he also took charge of direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family takes over the cover of the editorial.
The sons of Burda are 19 and 17 years old. Their son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family companies are also not safe from the decline: "This has always affected families who are infected by the capital search, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "big deliriums," Burda says.
I do not see myself as a political precept of this country, as Springer was, nor do I want to play with the "Time" in the world league; these businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Anything - in terms of beauty and well-being - you can wish, within the reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed by the English Court, which has just opened in the Callao shopping centre (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation; Spasion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Taci furqueros; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitine and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the teatery is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes than this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unparalleled views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spain offers.
A total of 250 m2 is distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellitis or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide customers' steps, offering them a fully customized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key into a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly carry out our exercise table.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, the company Luis & Taci has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a custom way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Miscellaneous Sounds
It's about Christmas and it's never about to review the look of the stars to adapt them to our party dress.
The shape of the escort, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables we must take into account.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated escort. It's not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa electric company, together with the Barcelona City Council, has created the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, submitting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to push forward what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
It is the three cities elected by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT GREENDE.
Zapatero sees 'a calm horizon' for the engine sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a calm horizon" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has taken during the exercise to support the car sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a picture of abandonment, closing some of our main productive plants," the president of the government explained.
"Thanks to this plan and to the availability of brands to be followed in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a peaceful horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including in the Integrated Automation Plan (IPA), targeted 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Chief of Executive explained that this investment was committed both to developing new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government support measures for demand, in line with Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and has provided a "force increase" of registrations, which grew "about 40 per cent" in November.
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Hall of the Classic Vehicle will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine mount.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc. can be found.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies are Classics de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restaurant; Coupe-Francisco Puche car sales and restaurant; or Classic Coach, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Tests of ability abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sporting exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Evidence of skill with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in a circuit that is enabled outside the trade station.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sport is not denied with respect for the environment.
For this reason, you have just incorporated into Mazda3 the engine stop and start system -baptised as i-Stop-, a device that is at least currently only available with the engine 2.0 of petrol with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is highlighted by the good note reached throughout its set.
The finished, the completion of the vehicle, the viability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front boots have excellent ergonomics and subjectivity.
The touch of the steering wheel is also elusive.
Following the set made up of the toolbox and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and commands and attractive colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasted with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the habitat, this Japanese compact presents more than enough accommodation for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
A large and regular suitcase is added to all of this.
The engine standstill and automatic start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available with two litres and 150 horses and with the manual change of six steps.
This engine is a real delight. It is overloaded by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and its content.
And it is that although the most claimed Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not achieve a high number of kilometres per year should not discard this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for their high comfort of walking, and for their content consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the chosen version for the test is the Sportive, which incorporates a larger number of serial elements.
The serial equipment especially highlights the wheelchair exchange assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive internal mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air-conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth and 17-inch adjuvants.
In addition, if its equipment were limited, this version included the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: bixenone adaptive lamps and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among others.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It particularly highlights the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not realize many kilometers per year can choose from this i-Stop version, associated only with the engine of 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between EUR 21,770 of the Luxury finish and EUR 23,2,270 of the tested version - Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us every day a large dose of satisfaction.
'First' of luxury
L. A. covers the red sex screen of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie's hand.
The stars shined out more than ever in elegant models such as 'sexys' on the 'Nine' screen. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, chose for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see some type of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when Time magazine named him one of the year's products.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly rate, less than half of what is paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Given the success the company has pulled out two new devices: one exclusively thought for Twitter, the other with a free live data service instead of paying six more times for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as your U.S. counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up the data when crossing the border or desperately looking for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a phone connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but my experience requires a physical doctorate to understand them and some good glasses to read the little letter.
Repeated shots of the European Commission's ear to achieve affordable roaming rates for all of Europe have only had a tangible effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is fear to use the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (don't stop being curious to bear the name of Fon when Wifi is missing) gets this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet consultations.
No contracts and no gates.
It is a connected device and is paid for by buying it, not by month.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, a life-access option like what Peek already has in the United States.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I watch my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
The yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first American lady.
If he has already turned to Barack Obama's taking possession as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, he has certainly chosen to accompany him in the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has carried a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with brilliant reflections-, the two times the acting consisted of three pieces - clothed, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So, at first glance, it seemed that the first lady in the United States was following the star of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat clothing.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession of treatment of a fat fit, in Oslo it is a treciole with print.
The plugins have also varied: green middle tacon shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And also different is the paint: a collection on this occasion, the apple drops the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and work path of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey carried out between 9,737 women aged 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the labour field due to maternity.
The study shows that there are many differences at the start of life in pairs and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start living together before, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are lagging behind in life and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years of age after the start of living together, an increase of 4.1 women with fixed jobs have taken more time for their vital journey to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of their children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity even less on the timing of the pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differs the age of women when they get married and when they have the first birth.
According to the survey, the greater the level of education, the greater the age at which they are married and the greater the child at which they have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who have elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"An additional division among women is also established according to their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, middle or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child," explains Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become an image of different brand products, emphasizing the universal motto of 'Because I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actors in the international panorama, thus joins other famous figures of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (' Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonere').
In the male paragraph, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical partner in 'lost').
British Mode Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His top representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met in the annual award delivery, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one has missed the appointment.
The former Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chosen Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poquer de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty radiographs of writers who have spent their literary lives (and, in cases, also by others).
It does not do so in predictable and terrifying genres (biographical, life and work) but seeking something similar to the core of the creator's spark.
The trip has its excitement and Vicent does not save shocks or lighting.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave them here for a few minutes.
About Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual pulse, almost physical, the same thing that I felt without name: the pleasure against the accommodating destiny, the guiltless morale and the innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, without meaning, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was absorbed by this woman with a passion that lasted for 13 years, in which his flesh combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be scaled through the northern wall, from which the best climbers are once again disembarked."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
He himself once said that he was the heir of a county landman and others who was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the cry of demented from a bridge by that Munich character to take his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and made it on a journey running away from himself and calling for the posteriority with a violent speech to the guanos."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day he put on his knees and prayed, 'Dear God, I beg you to stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb these verses of Spencer were recorded: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the hard life delights death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depression.
The husband agreed with all normality to tell her that Eduardo VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
The case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness has never been given."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Saintos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try to do but pass Baroja over Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but bring the man's fame to serve him as her own pedestal?"
Cobard aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was passing through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada when a group of 15 to 18-year-olds passed by with her and our dog, a mestetist breed, rescued from the dog and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without saying a word, they came up with two paws that left the injured dog.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find fun in a free assault on a small and defenseless animal, which, by the way, was tied.
To this you have to add the sophistication that caused a woman who walked quietly and who, when intruded on these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, because an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elder or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday any day for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that it is useful for a lot and not to generate susceptibility, just to make it clear that the killer cowards were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to abuse for free an unprotected animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Vial Security (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmet, mainly among the younger motorists, today informed both entities.
This initiative seeks to be aware of the importance of using helmet as it is the only protection element capable of avoiding head injury or even death in the event of an accident while driving.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "go beyond designing and making products every day safer" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmet in the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which cartels will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since while being a two-wheel vehicle manufacturer, one of its main purposes is to develop ever more secure products.
Raise the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in Spain in November represent a 12.6 per cent increase in 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of descent, according to the figures of the Anfac manufacturers and the Ganvam sellers.
The good data, not ostentatious, should be put in quarantine as the reference to which the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the last month's repertoire, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold, all the vehicles that make up the belt box of light commercials have been sold: from tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and trucks/light chassis.
In addition, the nubarrons that are most affected by their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, restrictions on the close grip of bank credit must be added to other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this picture and unlike tourism, aid for the purchase of 2000E has recently been used.
They can be accommodated, in addition to individuals, autonomouss and SMEs who are going to purchase a small trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Yesterday, they again recalled the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industry (cars and buses).
The association of sellers predicts a 2010 similar to the end of the year, for which a fall in sales (from tourism and 4x4) is calculated by 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the ABS brake block and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency brake support systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all light re-registration tourism and commercial vehicles, while for the rest there is a period of deficiency until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions in scope.
The emergency brake assistant is what makes the brake pressure on the brakes increase in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the piston that the driver gives.
But this doesn't always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of vehicle components Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to tread the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided annually.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four synestries would be avoided with damage to people - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and alerts the driver, as well as act lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors late until January the plan for Opel
While Opel plant workers in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been advised by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on the 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed on by the party concerned.
And this can make the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the Governments of the countries in which there are factories fall back to the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, from GM it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contact with some new possible buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but it takes strength to collect the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skype, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to Baic China.
The decision to close Saab is maintained at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the Porsche Boxster Spyder wheel
In order to develop its last and most precious face, Porsche engineers took Boxster S as their base and managed to reach no less than 80 kilos, leaving the bascule in only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to disregard, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplied by a lone with manual action, with which they save 21 kilos; using aluminium doors such as GT3, 'caen' others 15; removing the air-conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel storage from 64 to 54 litres, they won 7 more kilos; mounting sports backpacks other 12 and with light 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door drawers by one screen, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the double hug PDK change, the test was carried out on a unit with the manual six-speed box, mainly by secondary roads of California, in the mountain sections with really rotated plots
Its behavior can only be described as inaccessible.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not tread the asphalt with ampoule.
Rather, everything else: it was time we didn't test a model so small and light that, at the same time, it was so safe to pass through the curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk during the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, stop, recover and express his motor...
What we're asking you to do, thanks to your address, as accurately as possible, what we're pointing out with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with a surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be powered with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine bramide, already strung previously in the Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether from standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we went through with the Boxster Spyder was pretty well punished, but the car said the bays well.
The electronic aid only made an act of presence throughout the journey; and what we find in some of the curves is ice when it comes down and heavy, well into the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light car, of the most fun driving that one can drive on the market and that is something more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Intimacy of Karl Lagerfeld, image of Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlet' of the 'maison' shows, the singer spreads his face of malata with as much contumacy as his canel bags.
Rather than Bad Girl or It Girl, it's a Bad Girl.
The Basque Country Gives a Victory in Israel
The Laboral Box achieved a brilliant triumph for 82-91 on its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra box, despite the many lows with which the Dusko Ivanovic team counted, and in this way it is located in the leadership of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which with eight triples was the best of its team (29 rating).
The Victorian team was supposed to provide the important absences of Hermann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to deal with the victory.
In addition, the big gap from the perimeter, with 16 triples notes had much to do with the final triumph.
The game started face-to-face for the blues, which were put from the start in the marker.
That the first four canasts of the winners were from the perimeter already presage that they had jumped into the Israeli cage with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second room was more than the same, but the Alavese team chose for Barak's internal game and Elijahhu's work, which was received with kisses and applause on the return to which his home was, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less than six' of Splitter's rating had already presaged that it was not going to be Brazil's best night.
But the party, despite being in charge of rest, was not determined nor much less, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the winners that in their cage they didn't earn any, and with 'the hand of Elijah' they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini have made a decisive contribution to the return to the light (50-49).
More inconvenient
Ivanovic's men, wounded but not much less dead, needed to row a pair of games with open air to catch, and in them came Mirza Teletovic's machine gun, which with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a calming income (54-67), which they managed to make the premises at the end of the third room (57-67).
The alaves left the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated due to faults, Ivanovic's men were not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the party already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent the battle of Unicaja
The Unicaja lost in Greece tight in front of the Olympics and handed over to him the leader of Group B of the Euroliga, in a party marked by the cassettes, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flagship of peace and friendship, nor by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe, with a large budget.
The game shown in the first room allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio, slipped into the premises 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja , although the locals' arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave it back to Marker 22-20, minute 13, when an action, battle Count, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, was subjected to the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function by showing its superiority in both areas, where the lower due to damage to the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez were tearing the cassettes.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible to mount
The third period was very offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be higher and even came to equalize the difference between the meeting in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group leader tumble.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last drop of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all the inconveniences, the Unique for the direction and triples of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympics, when they pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area, proved impermeable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to get the basket back 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja turned off, delivering the leader to the Olympics.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the searcher with more classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? Calculate the user's wages from the more than 140.000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must enter your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the searcher has detected that, in general, the Spanish worker "is feeling unpaid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to data from Trovit's researchers in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges EUR 45.226 per year and one French, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish receives.
Similarly, a driver charges EUR 34.247 annually net in England, EUR 25.751 in France and EUR 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of the waiter, with 11,592 net annual; followed by the dependent, with 14,725 euros; and by the operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the network in the last three months are driving, middle-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date to the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has put Manuel Zelaya in office in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic link by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when he will officially complete his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave before that ambassador's date, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, when he has completed his mandate, he has to look for another destination."
The station also quoted the former MP, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally turned out to be frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the condition of political asylum that was intended to impose on her "de facto" government by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since the spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty is once again reappearing in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise markets was to settle debt with direct purchases of assets and indirectly to give liquidity bar near zero so that financial institutions would buy assets to dispose of them.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they start throwing some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of the corporate bonds have been reputed, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached early in the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the chosen refuge by investors, leading to an extension of the differentials in the euro area countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this episode of instability but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review at the bottom of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of uncertainty is not bad for the moral risk defenders who were trying to re-establish awareness of world economic policy leaders because they had hindered the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new day of thank-you.
However, Dubai seems to have a tribal struggle between emirs to recompose power in the emirates and Greece's one we've seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that takes away the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro Member State to meet its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of the normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excessive positions, it would be within the expected range.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt extend to the same extent as European corporate bonds we should not worry.
If European differentials are decreasing and our numbers continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing the majority of study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to review their stage upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, who are recharged with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not expect much hope of life for their warning.
Again, it has the whole picture that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, friend driver".

The President of Iberdrala, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Congress of Deputies' subcommission in which the energy strategy of Spain is being discussed these days in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the President of Natural-Fenosa Gas, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a brush of what he had posted in the closed-door subcommission.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another 6 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are still open today.
If this is not the case, the necessary investment will not be 6 billion, but up to 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investment should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but at distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue changes and power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas plants and coal with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that there is a need for 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Law on Sustainable Economy that has just been approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to bleed with the real decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should start to take place as they are already slow to maturity and a stable wage framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Air Lingus' action in ten airports
The Ferrovial subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Switzerland Swissport, is going to play the preferred partner of the Irish Aer Lingus airport for cargo services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not exceeded the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre
The partnership provides for an investment of 20 million to 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the work of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Action disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It fights for its first freeway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and a water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (approximately €1047 million).
French Bouygues and Sister Hochtief are on their rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometers in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for Action to sit in the country as a construction and dealer of motorways.
City City Council wants to keep it up by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP for its English stamps) to move the project forward, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the pay.
Pending their tenders next May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million in Australian dollars (1,047 million) and, in the final stage, three consortia with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Actiona, the only Spanish in the league, and its companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European experts in underground works.
Against the Action team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues, is playing against the Action Team.
The third and last consortium that has passed the creba is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Lighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated in the ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala company specialized in the civil work of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it leads to a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the cited Hochtif or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and continues to be pending allocation for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of the Laighton.
Millionaire assets
It acts by a geographical area of maximum importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the business of eviction.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for raising and managing Adelaide eviction, with a budget of 700 million.
Their intention is now to consolidate these two areas and exploit synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and operation fields.
The underground payroad, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and called Northern Link (north link), is called for connecting Toowong's western highway with the roundabout in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane's traffic.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to design in 2005.
It will include two wheelchairs per purpose, an electronic pay system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute $500 million (EUR 308 million) to its financing.
Brisbane offers business in Hochtiv
Australia continues to yield remarkable fruits to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that a contract with the government was awarded in 154 million.
The ACS participant will enable, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will provide fast Internet access to 400,000 people and will provide work to Germany for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has crossed the 27-plant King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtiv has closed the sale in 129 million.
Already in the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two school centers for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway of Slovenia amounting to EUR 64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after it is done with the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
Thus, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The beginning of the works is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Ms. Rushmore for an estimated amount of three million euros annually, the railway operator reported.
The contract collects the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been elected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Lots of 63 million in France Telecom to stop competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Telecom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signature of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programmes to consumers beyond regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still the state company have accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for putting their competitors at risk.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recurrent.
Application Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed the star of other operators and has opened a store of internet applications, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to be expected in 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Play the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth clubs that have won more money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from the major clubs.
Thus, the competition has allocated EUR 5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well off in this department.
The White Club has been the third of the continent that more money has been paid to participate, and the only one, next to the Milan AC, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extensive European Cup in 1992 is the fifth of the ranking.
The list is led by Manchester United and the Munich Bayern, the two teams that also billed more money to participate in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated cash-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Out of this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the pre-classification round (including Madrid's Athletic) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they competed for.
There are also bonuses for winning (EUR 800,000) and for empathizing (400,000 for each team). Octavofinalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be paid 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million finalists.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, paid 2.5 million to win the Europe Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four seats assigned.
The previous year's champion remains with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of parties played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group destroyed yesterday the details of the sale of shares with which it continues to acquire a peak of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public procurement offer (opa) for the whole of the titles.
In particular, New Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per action to be disbursed in 10 years and to be paid with an interest in this delay of 1% annually
Yesterday Sos's shares closed to EUR 1.85; therefore, New Rumasa's offer is estimated to be 18% below the market.
According to New Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos's real valuation.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jerezano group gives a 15-day term for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
CNMV made sure it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this was done, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when Sos's capitalization was 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to remain on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial waves of its former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Maria Luisa Jorda as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a high position in the food business.
This is a new establishment that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company continues to engage in the legal battle for the alleged deviation of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
With regard to the Salazar credit, the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared yesterday in the National Court yesterday that they approved the deviation of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion uncle who presented Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion pope presented by Investor Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorises this operation when it understands that its terms are in accordance with the applicable rules and considers the contents of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced last 2 December.
CNMV has indicated that the offer is directed to the acquisition of 550,008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of its social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading in the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the existing legislation.
New tool to explore cars
In these days of times and accidents, not only do they win car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered from a sinister are dragged to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is equal, and calculating the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complicated work.
Manually, the cost of repairing between €20,000 and €30,000, including work pieces, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent IT tools, it would be a matter of decline
Thus, almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Providers of services and solutions for the evaluation of synergies and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to their customers, and then to develop and offer them to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Solar Group, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of measuring and processing tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years there have been two versions, variants of imotorizations than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car gets out of the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be cataloged and their price entered.
In addition, each model features a "intelligent" graphic image where different parts of tourism can be "pinned".
If it is a sales model, the work can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audex has full information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models are information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that flows, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of databases, Audex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries also have tools for handling parts of waste or to calculate the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of users in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but yes in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to develop an idea of the type of support that professionals in the sector can provide.
This company offers ten different tools, being the AudaPlus star product, the standard sinister evaluation solution for experts.
It includes light or heavy industrial cars, motorcycles and vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the pieces, include the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each evaluation.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75, for low-use customers, up to 10 times a month.
After each insurance company, which carries out thousands of searches, negotiates its price with Audex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the mounting line only with its number.
AudaGlass focuses on the months of the vehicles, and AudaSubbastas is an open service to the professional online sector that allows you to climb by the declared vehicles total sinister.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by homodole marks.
For example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to abrasions or how many serious sinisters have been suffered in a particular period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Commercialize, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, damage or maintenance of the car
The Gt Rating Guide is its historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has grown at a rate of 20% per annum over the last three years, and in 2008 it billed 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, their internationalization process began, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remain in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audtex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, an increase of 3.3 per cent in 2008.
In our country, the company will enter EUR 19.1 million, a 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solar Group was worth $1 billion in Stock Exchange, and its shares now amount to a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been contributing to the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Online auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solar Group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction was subject to a disbursement of EUR 59.5 million by 85% of the capital of society, which could be extended to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase service is directed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, riots and professional vendors who must register before they start operating.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of builders has been dropped cannot be recirculated, but it can be used as a spare for certain parts that are not damaged.
Historic cars can be very high even though they have been reported low after a rough operation.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the replacement, creating a budget and generating a budget.
The ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, that to a greater or lesser extent they are more likely to be more responsive to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 tourists, 109 all-terrestrials, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
