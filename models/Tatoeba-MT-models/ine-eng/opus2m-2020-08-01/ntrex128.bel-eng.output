Valiant additional deputies are concerned that they look like puppets.
Some Members do not understand why their status as Members of the Wells Parliament should be changed.
The deputies were upset about the plans to change the name of the local town hall called Parliament Wells.
Deputies of all political views believe it's some kind of conspiracy.
One of the libertarians said his colleagues were concerned that it was repudiated by the words "stupid" and "nedar."
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "nedar".
The deputy said that her group was completely dissatisfied and offered alternatives.
The Valiant Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the change in the East, but they noted that it was a brief verbal transition from a Walloon Parliament member to a puppet.
In this context, the waly letter in is spoken in the same way as the Yorkshire English word u.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is now drafting a bill on the adoption of amendments to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the Members of the House are calling will, of course, be the question of the members themselves."
The Wells Government Act since 2017 gives the Valais East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that provided broad support for calling the Parliament's East.
As far as the title of an additional deputy is concerned, the Commission has given preference to a member of the Parliament of Wales or the CPU, but the CPU version has received the greatest support during public consultations.
The additional deputies are obviously proposing alternative variants, but the way to reach consensus can be a major pain to seniors, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to be presenting a bill of several weeks' duration of change.
The Reform Command will also include other changes to the Assembly, such as the rules on the disqualification of additional deputies and changes to the structure of the committees.
The additional deputies have a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they do their job.
Macedonians vote on the country's rename referendum
On Sunday, voters are calling for a change in the name of their country on or against the Republic of North Macedonia.
The national vote was organised to resolve a multi-year issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens they long insisted that their North Neighbor's name represents a claim on their territory that prevented Macedonia's involvement and friendship in EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
President of Macedonia Georgie Ivanov, a referee for a change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is just a cost that must be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The called temple of St. Martin's silence, the churches in Harlem struggle for existence
"Before, as the old people I spoke to had been a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
"Today is neither the one nor the other."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different relationships and relationships at present," he said.
"The barriers are no longer the cozy local lodges where people walk constantly."
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale was not stopping for as long a period as the leaders were expecting, and sooner or later they would return to where they had begun.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by living ladies with candinamies filled with people who will not help the temple that will remain in the area.
"The vast majority of residents who buy candaminiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and this will speed up the day when these churches will close together, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these candaminiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by a white band before Harlem became a black area – the Church of St. Martin in 1870 – after ten years.
The first white Methodist district left in the 1930s.
The black neighborhood, which was praying nearby, had the right to own the building.
The Church of St. Martin was fascinated by a black-skinned society under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who had set up a trade fair in the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or pursue black-skinned.
The fire left the building severely damaged in 1939, but the reindeer under the direction of Father Johnson planned the reconstruction: they went into the operation of the coral.
Similar to David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father, and some successor to St. Martin's Church, he proudly called the coral "poor people".
An expert who played the coral in July called it "Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
An expert at Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that it was the first coral in the world to be played by a black-skinned musician, Dianius A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a large coral in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merrivezer said that the Church of St. Martin had not replaced it.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months was a complicated story between architects and traitors, some of whom were attracted by false church leaders, others by egyptians.
The meeting of the faithful, the governing body of the income, consisting of the assistant chaplains, was written in the eparchy in July with a warning that the eparchy was "trying to transfer expenses" to the eparity of the faithful, although it was not involved in the recruitment of architects and subcontractors who were sent by the eparchy.
Some guests complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy during a nightingale hunt in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting on Lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning near the Bacon Beach in Ensinits.
Chad Hemel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was dealing with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help and then swam with the others to help get him out of the water.
Hemhel at first thought it was just an excitement from catching the Lobsters, but then he realized something bad had happened: 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
"All his key was broken," said Hemel, adding that he noticed it when he came to the boy.
I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, "In the water near the shark!" said Hemhel.
The boy was transported by air to a baby's hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The variety of sharks that have been attacked is unknown.
The savior of Captain Larry Giles reported on the media briefing that the shark had been observed in this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe diversity.
Giles added that the suffering got trauma to the top of the floor.
Officials closed their approach to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of shark live in this area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to advance to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, opening the blocks with beauty goods in universities where trained specialists will work.
As part of a significant strand on the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings that continue to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion and household goods decreases, the larger beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons next year, demonstrating success.
Investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the place on the streets that were previously occupied by television sets, microwave ovens and furniture for the house.
Sainsbury's said to double the amount of beauty products, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which appear for the first time.
An existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in firm departments like those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
Big stores are also relaunching their cosmetic shop, so most products will fit for giants, and this trend is becoming more and more demanding among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened last week in Croydon on the south of London, and the second opens in Sally-Ovk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Buying online and going to buy a small number of products every day in local stores around the house leads to more efforts being made by the supermarket to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the trading points would be more and more similar to the universe, because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's instructors, Lidl with more services and non-harvesting.
Sainsbury's placed Argos' trading points in hundreds of stores, and also settled several Habitats' points since the time when two years ago acquired both networks that, he said, contributed to growing sales of food products and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to rebuild its beauty and pharmacy has not been successful.
Sainsbury's protested a mixed company with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to share revenues from the pharmaceuticals ended after a series of break-ins in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its optical business together with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's optical network for 125 million pounds of sterling.
It was stated that Lloyds had played his part in this plan, expanding the range of luxurious brands to take care of the skin, including the number La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We also invested in teaching our staff who could offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands are designed to take into account any needs, and the attractive stay and comfortable accommodation make us a better home of beauty that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones was excited after Holly Willowby turned down the deal for 11 million pounds of sterling.
The Dragons Den Peter Jones was thrilled after the television show Holly Willowby refused to trade for 11 million pounds of sterling with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Willowby there is no time for brand goods for home and accessories True.
The business pair became like the brand Gunet Peltrow Goop.
This morning the 37-year-old leader announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left the Dragon's Den Peter Jones star, which is now separated from his business of making brand clothes to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Jones was thrilled when a "golden" television girl admitted during a tense meeting in the capital of his business empire in Marlowe (Bakinghamshire) that her new transactions of up to 1.5 million pounds of sterling mean that she will no longer have enough time to deal with home appliances and accessories of the True brand.
The business was similar to the brand Guinette Peltrow Goop and was raised twice to double Willowby's profits in 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced in Instagram that she had left True, Jones flew from Britain and headed into one of his homes for rest.
The source said: Truely was Holly's main priority.
It appeared to her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what had happened on Tuesday, very soon had to start dinner.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that the departure of the leading This Morning, which comes in the number of the most important British stars, can cost millions of companies because of huge investments in various goods -- from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as because of the possible further delays in their performance.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Johns and his wife, Tara's Cape for ten years.
Willowby founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the leadership in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40 percent part of Baldwin's television company.
Willowby is the representative of the M&S brand and replaces this McPartlin as the leading ITV "I'm a celebrity".
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We won't comment on his case."
A sincere conversation "after which we fell in love"
He gave up on the criticism he received from the media for his comment that he considered "unprecedented" because he was in a position to speak of a North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump much refuse?
The tramp said to his so-called "dedicator" voice.
"I don't deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards denouncing North Korea.
But the denouncing talks came into the loop.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Lee Un Ho announced to the World Leader at the General Assembly of AAN on Saturday that the North did not expect the "relevant principles" of the United States in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the field of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The Trump took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We are very successful in building relationships with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended with the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim led to positive results: the completion of rocket trials, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his extraordinary approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"Being on the President's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we'll already have about 200 people," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the islands, hundreds of people died.
For example, after the earthquake on W. Lambock outside the organization, they said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lamboc's population had been relocated, there was no notification of the national disaster, which is the necessary condition to provide international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they did not seek international assistance, so it was a little difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Even though the Save the Children Foundation is gathering a team to travel to Palau, it still doesn't understand if foreign employees can work in places.
Mr. Sotopa, the representative of the National Agency for Disaster Management, said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see if the international agency would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite earthquakes that always survive in Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the unexpected of nature.
Although in Achae there were built shelters, in other coastal villages they were almost gone.
The apparent failure of the siren to warn about the tsunami in Paul led to a greater number of casualties, though the warning was.
Even at the best of times, the movement between many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And the hurdles have complicated the pathology.
The hospital ship, which was located at W. Lambok for the treatment of the earthquake victim, is approaching Pala, but the path to the new place of distress will take no less than three days.
President Joe Oodda set up his pre-choice campaign to improve Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and spend money on automobile roads and gypsums.
But the lack of funding is being followed by the administration of Joke, because next year there will be new elections.
Mr. Joke also faces a tense interconfessional tension in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority take more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Look: Daniel Stridge from Liverpool pushes the ball away from Chelsea
Daniel Starry saved Liverpool from Chelsea's defeat at the Prime Minister's office, adding the number to the 89th minute on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge.
Oldie got a transmission from Jordan Shakire when they were about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate, which was 1-0.
He made the fine ball left of himself before he shot himself in the remote barn.
The attempt ended by killing high under the upper barn when the ball flew right into the top right corner of the net.
The sword resulted in flying over the head of the Cape of Arizona, which jumped directly into the net.
"He just tried to get into this position to pull the ball, and players like Shak always tried to push as far as possible forward, so I just tried to win us as much time as possible," said Starryge in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen that running into Conte, made the post easy, not too much thinking about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea was 1:0 at the beginning of the second time after the 25th minute the Belgian star Eden Azar was killed.
By attacking the blues in this match, he made Matthew Kovacic's pass before returning to the semi-defence zone and running to half the Liverpool field.
The cook soon found himself in the center of the field.
Then he made an effective blow, conveying Azar's ball to the door.
Azar ran to the protector and ran into the lower left corner of the remote stong past the guard of Liverpool, Ellisan Becker.
Liverpool competes with "Napali" at the group stage of the League of Champions for 3 hours on Wednesday at San Paulo Stadium in Italian Naples.
Chelsea meets Videoton at the UEFA European League in 3 hours a day on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of people killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reported Sunday morning on the Agency for the Elimination of Disasters.
At the press conference, a representative of Sotopa Purvo Nugroho said that according to the news, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake of 7.5 balls, which occurred on Friday and called for a seven-metre wave.
The city of Palau, in which more than 380,000 people live, was swept away by the ruins of ruined buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder after they cut a woman.
The murder investigation was initiated after the woman's body was found at Birkenheid (Mercyside) this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with violent injuries in the Grayson-Museum District on John Street Street, and the 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police called for people from this area who had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to contact anyone who was around John Street in Birkenheid or saw or heard something suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also call on everyone, in particular, taxi drivers, video recorders, who may have taken off some video, to contact us because they can have information that is extremely important to our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman, the body that was found, lived near Birkenheid and was found in her own house.
Today a friend of women came to the scene to ask: where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Muse just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what had happened.
The resident is now saying that it will be another few hours before they are allowed to return.
The police explained to one person that the whole area is now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene.
She said, "That's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the transverse perimeter, and another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter researching a multi-story building.
All who have information must contact @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously at 0800 555 111, calling 247 since 30 September.
The parliamentary statue of Cromwell became the last centuries of the "recording of history".
His removal would be a poetic justice for him similar to the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "stupid" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the head of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the present debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would be the object of these acts.
The iconography of English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps poor Romwell will be sacrificed for his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The vivid presentation by Mr. William Hamm Thorncroft about the Cromwell is a testimony to the 19th century's idea and part of the history of action, which many believe should be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith said The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people know from the end of the 19th century better than today, as a protector of parliament from outside pressure, in his case it was monarchy.
Or it's a very accurate presentation, a subject of long history debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped our nation's next development, and Romwell is an individual well-known figure that represents one of the sides of this confrontation.
His achievements as the Lord's protector also deserve to be noted and respected."
A pig-slaughterer has led to the death of a Chinese farmer.
As local media reported, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
“A man known only by name – Yuan – was found dead with a broken artery and a yellow blood, next to a candle on the market in Lupanishu in the Guychev province,” the newspaper South China Post reported on Sunday.
Swine moved to introduce the vaccine as a pig in a pighouse in China on May 30, 2005, in the Chinese province of Kinshasa.
As reported, he and his cousin came in from the next ten years to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the next piggyback was open.
He said that there was a great rabbit with blood on his ass.
According to the report, the medical expert confirmed that a 350-pound rabbit had deprived the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were curved and damaged," said a cousin named Wu (according to the quotes of Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John went to the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager reported to Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to the news, the family of Yuan and the administration of the market are talking about compensation for his death.
Even if pigs attack people, they're rare, but they were before.
Yes, in 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighed 650 pounds and pressed a whale farmer to his tractor and kept it that way until his wife let the animal go.
After a farmer from the state of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a drop-off worm.
"They're just gullible.
They're delicious and very experienced... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the Rose hurricane bring strong rains to the southwestern US.
According to the estimate, the Rosa hurricane is weaker because it moves above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa has taken the lead in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
The speed of Rose, the hurricane of 1 category, was 85 miles per hour 5 hours in the morning as early as Sunday, and it was recorded in 385 miles south-west of Punt-Euchenia in Mexico.
Rose, as expected, is heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, it begins to form a low-pressure area east to the western US coast.
On Monday, Rosa will be taken to some parts of Mexico to 10 percent of the cases.
Then the tropical wet, which interacts with the approaching low pressure area, in the next few days calls for strong lions in the south-west.
Places from 1 to 4 inches in the fall call for dangerous sudden floods, desert floods and possible floods in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to the number of falls in places to reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of the southern Nevada and the Arizona.
In some parts of the north-west, especially in most of the Arizona, it's expected from 2 to 4 inches in cases.
Due to the grouped areas of tropical rains, a possible sudden turnout is possible under the condition of a rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go out into the desert on foot because of the possibility of the threat of tropical accidents.
A strong rain may lead to the canyons turning into stormy rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by fair winds and dust.
The upcoming low-pressure area brought strong rain to the southern California coast.
Possible summary falls more than half can lead to a slight stream of garbage and make slippery roads.
This will be the first drop in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach the Arizona at the end of the week and at the beginning of Monday before the rain will go everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread in the four-point district on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, strong temperatures in the United States can be observed, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes in the near future.
There's a good example of a sharp drop in temperature in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amaha (Nebraska), St. Louis and De Moin (Aowa), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
For the next few days, the long summer will try to grow stronger and expand again.
In many central and eastern United States, it is expected that a warm, 80-degree October October will start from the South Plains to the North East.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavan’s hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks were looking at interesting testimony from witnesses in the Supreme Court on the matter between Brett Kawan and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political resistance continues, the ministers interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news on Friday: a report prepared by Regional Senator Jeff Fleke for the FBI: it was to conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court that she was 100 percent sure that Dr. Kawan had grabbed her and tried to get her clothes off for dinner at an older school.
The coffee in his stiff testimony said that for 100% sure it wasn't.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were looking at him.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen, there are usually problems with rated people watching TV in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in the play-off or Oscar prize.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts have strongly supported Kavana's appointment, managed all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day," said Nielsen.
ABC took the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million," said Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearings.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the deceased Republican published a statement that he would vote in Cavan's support, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protestors were shouting at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator to hear from the Court Committee.
He stood with his eyes peeled for a few minutes when he was lashed, and it was broadcast in a straight effigy on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"What do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have the authority, but many women have been deprived of it."
Flake said that his office had published the application, and announced before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All the cables and billboards several hours spent direct broadcasters, when the Court's committee had to vote on the question of the selection of the Kawan candidacy at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said that he would do it, just because he understands that the FBI is going to deal with charges against the candidate next week, which is what the minority democrats are calling for.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kuns and several senators Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had power, because it was clear that there would be no votes in the Republicans to confirm the Coffee without investigation.
President Trump started investigating charges against Kavana at the FBI.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "games in politics" because of the brigade
During a Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the criticism that she is planning to leave the European Union, that they are "playing in politics" with the future of Britain and ruining national interests.
Prime Minister Teresa May of Britain attended the Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview next to her at the front end of the paper, she was the foreign minister of the Boris Johnson case, who spoke against her so-called "sexic" board plan, stating that the proposal for Britain and the EC to have the only tariffs was "very flawed".
Killing Wade Sims: Police arrested a suspect in the death of LSU Dietéon Simpsan.
The police arrested a suspect in a death shot at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana University.
"The 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson was arrested and put in prison for murder at a second stage," said Baton-Ruze police chief.
The officers showed a video of the shooting between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the shooting.
"Police took the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA," said WAFB, a CBS branch.
After questioning Simpson's police said he had confessed to a death shot in Wade.
"The cost of the bet is set at $350,000," says the Advocate.
The next revision of the Eastern Batan-Russia published on Friday a previous report saying that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department of the Louisiana State Police Operational Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police Department, is asking residents of the area to assist with the investigation that would support the arrest.
Louisiana University Sports Director Joe Aleva thanked the district's law-enforcement body for "care and seeking justice".
Six was only 20 years old.
As he grew up, 6 feet grew up in Baton-Rose, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
In the middle of the last season, he picked 5.6 points, 2.6 sets for the game.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at the University of Louisia, Will Wade, said that the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
"That's what I always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano dumps ashes in Mexico City
Ash, which is cast off by a volcano of Papacapeptel, reached the southern areas of Mexico's steel.
The National Center for Disaster Warnings on Saturday offered Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and 183 cases of gas and ashes were recorded for 24 hours.
The center was a sensitive grout and felt a push.
The images on social media have shown that in the neighborhood of Mexico, such as Cechimilka, there are thin layers of papal cover on the car windshield.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) from the south-east of the steel post-magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Cops with Catalan separatists who voted in previous years for independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the independence supporters met with the police in civil order and thousands of others joined the demonstration in the name of the first year of the Palestinian poll in Catalonia.
A group of separatists in masks, who were held by police in public order, laid their eggs and blossomed with purple paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighters exploded when the police used their dens to stop the demonstrators.
For a few hours, a group of independent combatants who have been blackmailing "Do not forget, don't forgive," have been confronted by the present professional action that shouted, "Live Spain."
According to local press reports, fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries in protest proceedings.
The tension in the region that seeks independence remains high a year after the 1st October referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which was marked by separatist Catholics.
The voters in most cases were far from independent, although the voters' appearance was low, which was largely interpreted by the vote-by-election.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in the summer after the police tried to stop voting in the polling stations throughout the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The independent groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police.
The demonstration continued, but the protestors were forced to go another way.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who is present on a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expects the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
"It was summer that we survived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite the important but minor victory of the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, which are in favour of independence, have tried to preserve momentum this year with many of their most well-known leaders and have found themselves either in voluntary exile or in captivity waiting for the court to organize the referendum and the next declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean Puch, writing a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"Get up all the more stressed," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the CIS since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The selection of candidates for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after they smashed the house on the machine
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car suddenly broke into London’s house.
The incident took place in the Belinagard-Crescent District on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemings said he was damaged by the gate and the building itself.
Maybe at some point in the car a bullet was released.
Mang's Lvivingston hit wins the Rangers with 1:0.
The first goal of the Valley of Mangy for the benefit of Lvivingstan was to provide them with victory
The success of Lvivingstan has been called Rangers, and it has been seized to target Steven Gerard after him with a few defeats in 18 games on the crew of the Ibrox club manager.
The fall of the Valley of Mangy was great, because Harry Holta went up one level with the "Hibernian" in the second division.
The Gerard team in this season won't be able to go to the Prime Minister's office and meet with the leaders next week, the Harts team, who are left at eight points.
To this end, Rangers in the League of Europe will be receiving Rapid on Thursday.
"Livingston," meanwhile, continued his playless series in the division to six games, and Chief Coach Holt still feels right after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
"Livingstan" misses chances because of rough visitors
The Holta command had to warn long before they were killed, but such a direct call to Rangers posed various problems.
Scott Robinson broke up, but lost his chance to kill himself at the gate, after which Alan Litts could only direct his efforts wider to meet the impact of Craig Halket.
The gentlemen were pleased to allow Rangers to play before them, knowing that they could bother the guests at some point.
And that's exactly how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers were allowed a criminal blow, and Lvivingston was sending the deb, Declane Gallagher and Robinson gathered to overcome Mengo, who did the post and killed him from the center of the field.
By this time the Rangers were domaind, but it was found that the protection of the team was uncomfortable, and the Liam Kelly locker was practically inactive.
So it went on in the second half, although Alfred Marrelas really saved Kelly.
The sword from Scott Pittman was rejected by the Rangers' locker by Alan McGregor, and the Litgos departed far from the second set of Lioningstone.
The swords were constantly trapped in the Lvivingstan gate, and were rejected, while the two requirements of the Penalties, after the Halket was called for replacement of Glen Midland, and the requirement of punishment by the hand of the game, were rejected.
"Pionomen" from "Livingstan" – Analysis
journalist BBC Scotland Alexander Lamant on the Arena Tony Macaroni
Famous productivity and results for Lvivingstan.
For men they were wonderful, continuing beyond the expectations of this ascending path.
Their style of play and composition had practically not changed since they had returned to the higher stage, but it was worth giving the right Holt for how he had stimulated the team from the moment it arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was a grandiose, raising well-organized defense while Mengo was holding Conar Goldsan and Joe Waral around the field.
Rangers didn't get an inspiration.
No matter how good they weren't at George's, they didn't meet that standard.
In the last match, they didn't own a ball, just one time killing in the door, which was kind of an alarming call for Rangers, which appeared in the middle of the list.
Mixed view of Erdogan in Kolne
On Saturday, 29 September, they saw a smile and felt groundless flight when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erragan's presidential visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They fought about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
In this city, the largest number of Turkish populations live outside Turkey.
The police rescued the security claim not to let 25,000 people gather in front of the ball, but a lot of supporters were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erragan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politician Erragan and the German government's decision to greet him in the country.
Protests for and against reflect the disparity of the guest, whom some German Turks have declared to be a hero, and others have condemned as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deftford: Raviers died in a car crash
Raviris died as a result of a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the crossing of the streets of Unstudent Street and Evelyn Street, a lively road in Deptford, on the south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, the workers arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident took place a few months after another Ravarian died as a result of a meeting at the Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Saturday crash.
The static police reported that their employees were working on identifying a person and reporting him to their closest relatives.
Around that place there are road traffickers and bus stops, and the car driver was recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Tower: Six staff members injured during riots
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of riots in the prison of a strict regime for men," says Penitentiary Correction.
The riots erupted in Long Lartin prison in Wisstershire at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue.
In order to combat riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, the Tarnada group was attracted.
At the scene of the collaborators went through the treatment of minor injuries.
The Penitentiary's representative said: "The specially trained prisoner was directed to combat those who had committed riots in Long Lartin's prison."
Six staff were treated after the trauma.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we realized that the guilty will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
The Queen's Long Lartin prison contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the chief of the prison went through hospital treatment after the arrest of the prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers from civil society were summoned to prison to deal with serious riots, during which officers were attacked with waterpowder balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which may be useful for drought regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but that's what can happen at the beginning of next week, because there's still a trace of the "Rosa" hurricane in the south-west part of the desert that poses a risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service published data on the sudden floods in the western Arizona and in the southern and eastern Nevada, southern eastern California and Utah, including the numbers in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake Network.
It is expected that Rosa will go straight through Phoenix, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have brought tropical storms or a drop of pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the border with the state of Arizona."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre predicts the fall of cases from 2 to 4 inches, which can reach 6 inches in individual locations in the Magalion region of Arizona.
In other parts of the southwest of the desert, including the number of central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it's probably going to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with this individual result values can reach 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the risk of sudden flooding, the Rosa hurricane could be long-term because their region is suffering from drought.
Although the tide is a very serious problem, some of these cases are likely to be useful because in the south-west there are currently droughts.
According to data from the American Dry Monitoring Agency, approximately 40 percent of Arizona's territory survives an extraordinary drought in the second category," reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the fallouts of the Mexican semi-success of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rose still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta Euchenia in Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore dry.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico when the tropical storm comes, a river will emerge from the shores of the day or the evening on Monday.
The falls in various parts of Mexico can be strong to create a significant risk of flooding.
"There are expected to be a total number of cases from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to North-West Sanlar, where possible cases up to 10 inches," says weather.com.
Then the Rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning in the form of a tropical rise in pressure, which will then continue through the Arizona and the southern part of the state of Utah until the evening of the Tuesday.
"The main danger is expected from Rosa or her remains, it's a very strong rain in Lower California and in the north-west of Sanora and the South-West desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and desert streams and floods in the mountainous region.
The attack in Midsummer Norton: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested for attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a lot of gunshot wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terrace Excelsior district of Midsummer Northan about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remained in a stable state.
"The 17-year-old and both the other, the 18-year-old and the 20-year-old, were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Samersett," said the police.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what happened to move on in their search.
"Cacoano's acute from the spirit and anger of the Democratic Party," said Trump.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is the vote for the abolition of the insatiable and absurd tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp reported on the rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said that Cavano was "pained by anger and anger" by the Democratic Party in the process of his election to post.
The coffee showed up before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally refusing to accuse Christine Blaisey Ford of having sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave a statement during her prosecution hearings.
On Saturday, the President declared that "on this day the Americans saw a brilliant, good and courageous character" of Cavano.
"A voice in support of Judge Kavano is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of the right of our time, a lawyer with a great history of state service," he said to a crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president turned his attention to the Cavano election, talking about the importance of the Republicans during the interim elections.
"Five weeks remained to one of the most important choices of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for big candidates."
The problem is that the Democrats intend to "resist" and "stop".
"The first key procedural vote at the Senate level is expected to take place no later than Friday," CNN, a senior parliamentary assistant, announced.
Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of people suffering increases.
"At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of the floods of giant waves on the beaches when a huge earthquake and tsunami began on the island of Sulawesi," the government said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when they shouted six feet (18 m) high, fighting for the coast in the dark, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
As a result of a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, tsunamis occurred.
"When there was a threat of tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and not immediately fled, and they became victims," the president of the Indian Agency for Disaster Management Sotopo Purvo Nugroho said in his briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunamis dragged cars, beers, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunamis passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before the strike on the shoreline.
According to his words, some people survived only because they climbed the trees to escape the tsunamis.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Paul.
Aerial photographs published by an emergency agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were turned and dissolved, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next race continued to climb the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the district with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Assessment and Technology Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday is about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb's power released at Hirasim in World War II.
According to his data, the city's geography, which is at the end of the long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunamis.
He called it "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing without news.
"The roofs and damage can be large along the shoreline 300 km (190 miles) north of Paul, a region called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroha said.
Dongal's relationship "was totally damaged," said Nugroh.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," says the Red Cross statement, adding that its employees and volunteers were directed to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday the agency widely exposed that they had not reported the tsunamis in Paul, but the factors claimed that the waves had come at a time when a warning had been given.
In the amateur photos published on social media, you can hear a man on the top of the floor shouting people on the street warning about coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the water wall fell on the shore, dragging behind itself the buildings and the cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the removed material.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a severe power outage that has disrupted communication around Paul, so it was difficult for the authorities to mention saving actions.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still very much needed food and other items of first necessity.
The airport of the city was opened only for help and would be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joe Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palau.
As a result of the tsunamis in Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed
It's very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Danggala were successfully headed to the city of Paul, where workers were hiding in the brigades set up in their offices, they saw desertification scenes along the way," said Mr. Dosseb.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups have launched dark action at the start of disaster relief mechanisms, some have complained that foreign workers who possess deep knowledge are prevented from going to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel outside the border can only begin to proceed if the disaster is reported to be a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, president of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international help, but this status is not yet.
On the second night in Paul, after the earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, friends and family disappeared without news hoped that their close miracles would be among those who would leave the unhappy congestive lines of distress.
On Saturday the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday the saviors released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Hendon Sudan, a coach of the Indonesian national team on paraplanism, prepared two of the missing paraplans for Asian games that were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandague, including the number and others who were trapped in Roa Roa's hotel, were his students.
"As an elder in the field of paraplanism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told how a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel had spread among the planners' community, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the participants of Paul who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked by one gray branch, not two blues.
"That means messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while retrieval of Newport ATMs on the left.
"Friday the thief was robbed of $26,750 by a Brink employee who had a bank account in Newport, Libya," reported Newport Police Department.
"The car driver dropped the ATM in a fun complex and tried to deliver more money," wrote Dennis McCarthy in his release.
While he was busy, another man ran away from the workman, and stole me with the money destined for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed a number of suspects who left the scene, but the police did not adapt the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information about them should contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: Reper changes its name to Ye ("ti").
The Kanye West rapper changes its name to Ye.
When he announced a change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "I'm officially known as Kenny West."
The West, which was 41 years old, by the name of Y, used this nickname as its eighth album that came out in June.
Changes take place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to run his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Aryan Grande for a show, which was rejected for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
At the same time as shortening his current professional name West had previously said that this word had religious significance for him.
I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "you," said West at the beginning of this year, commenting on the name of the album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So, I'm -- it's you, it's me, it's us, it's all us
It came from "Kaney," which means "one" to "Ye" -- a reflection of our good, our bad, our wasted, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He was one of the most famous rappers who had changed his name.
Sean Combs was quite known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was inclined to the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former Westa's associate, Jay-Zie, also went unconnected and in general letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against peaceful residents
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel Lopes, abrassor, never use military force against civil society, as the country is nearing its 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, on the Tlatelolco Plaza Lopes Square, Abrador of the Fathers "never use the soldiers to please the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers launched a peaceful demonstration on the square, resulting in the death of about 300 people, while the left student movements were incarcerated throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador encouraged young Mexicans to support by issuing monthly grants to students, thus opening more free places at state universities.
"The unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups," he said.
The United States must double the funding for machine intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the US has to double the amount they spend on research in this field," says an investor and machine intelligence specialist in Kai-Fu Lee, who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after the various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if there's no official MI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030 it strives to be the first in the field of innovation.
"The allocation of the budget for research in the MY area would be a good start, considering that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we are waiting for the next break in the MY area," Lee said.
"Financing may double the probability of the next major achievement of the US MI," Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Excellent Machine Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houton Miflin Harkurt, is the lead executive director of the Sinovation Ventures company, which invested in one of the most famous MI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked on the machine intelligence system at the University of Carnegie-Melane, which won the US Athel himself, and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google Department in China.
Lee recognized the previous U.S. state-of-the-art technology companies, such as the Agency's laboratory companies on a previous research project in the field of defence, and asked if it would be next to help identify the following indicators.
"A U.S. researcher often has a lot of work to do to get state grants," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's a corporation," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have recently hired lighthouses from universities to work on the media.
Lee said that changing immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think green cards should automatically be offered by the candidate in the MI," he said.
In June 2017, the State Council of China issued a plan to develop the machine intelligence of the next generation.
"China's National Science Fund provides funding for people in educational institutions, such as the National Science Fund and other state organisations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China below," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence created a United States machine intelligence centre where partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Agency's recent research project in the field of defence reported investment of $2 billion called AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing in research into the MY more than $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the US leadership, which tried to create a National Security Commission for machine intelligence, has not been monitoring actions for several months.
Macedonians vote in favour of the country's change of name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in favour of a referendum on changing their name to the Republic of North Macedonia, allowing them to resolve a ten-year conflict with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has Macedonia's residence, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to its territory, and has put a vow on NATO and EC accession.
In June, both governments entered into a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said he wouldn't vote on the referendum, and the party questioned whether the voters would correspond at least 50 percent to the referendum.
The question of voting on the referendum is: ‘You are a member of NATO and EC with the consent of Greece.’
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is a cost that should be paid for admission to institutions such as EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgieski, 79, Skopje.
Although this is not an obligatory legal force, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will count the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires more than two thirds of Parliament.
The State Election Commission has stated that no violations have been reported until 1 hour.
However, it accounted for only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said a 62-year-old elector at Skopje's Jose Tanevsky.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritz and his son Duška voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the building of the parliament in Skopje, 54 years ago, he had a small scene and he had a chair in front of the tents set up by those who were going to make a referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to get together with our heads up, not through the service doors," the Cavadarks said.
"We are a poor country, but we have honor.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zayev said that NATO friends would make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think that the majority will be "for", because more than 80 percent of our citizens support EC and NATO," said Zayev after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, it is said that 30 to 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below what is necessary.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian telecom showed 57 percent of the respondents who are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they were saying yes.
For a successful egg reference there must be 50 percent plus one voice.
Failure in the referendum is the first serious blow to the policy of the western government since its arrival in May last year.
Look: Sergei Aguara from Manchester City goes through all the protection of Braitan
On Saturday, Sergei Aguare and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of Britain's victory of Manchester City at 2:0 Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At the 65th minute of Aguare, it was easy to do that.
Argentinian attacker got it then in the center of the field.
He raced between three Briton defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguara appeared among the four green shirts.
He passed by one defender and swallowed up a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed on the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English attacking the first touch in the criminal surrender of Aguare's ball, which used its right to hit to bypass the Braitan gate by hitting Matthew Ryan on the right side of the net.
"Aguara has some problems with her legs," said the journalist, the head of the town of Pep Guardiello.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he killed the naked at the same time."
But that's what Sirling gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of fighting at the Prime Minister's.
This goal happened at 29th minute.
Aguara got this ball at the bottom of the British territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy's dream.
She did a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far stand.
Attacking Sky Blues pointed the ball online before he jumped across the border.

Sherry wants to play the pickup point against the Year
After the Nationals had been excluded from the play-offs, there was no special reason to start a new start.
But the constantly competitive Shercer hopes to take a blow on Sunday against "Calad Rocky," but only if there's still a playoff for Rocky that remains in the leaders after one game with "Los-Angeles Dodgers" in the North West.
The years have taken, at least, a unique place with a victory number 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're playing just so, at least, we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and another team will be so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all that I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be in this computer?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give the Shercer ball in such a situation.
Sherzer, who was going to start his 34th, was on Thursday at the COPC session and will be on Sunday at the usual rest.

Trump Speaks in West Virginia
The president stood up to the situation around his election of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, speaking of the importance of the emergence of Republicans in the intermediate elections.
"All we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm fighting everywhere for the big candidates," he said.
The tramp continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, see what's happening now.
And they are determined to return power to themselves using any necessary means you can see -- vanity, moderation.
They don't care who they blame, who they have to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to his words, the Democrats intend to "resist" and "stop".
'And you see it in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'bad, false, vice versa and false.'
He fled to the Senate's court committee for the prior recognition of the Senator of the Democratic Group, Diana Fenstein, who received a sound assessment from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you really want to allow the document to be imported?
Uh-huh.
No, I don't expect -- it was a very bad nonverbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the main church.
This is the impatience of those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for me to be injured, it was hardly a surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Liberian Party to whom we are told not to welcome everything to express our opinion.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan got a similar return because she was determined to resist anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship revealed to me that I did not agree with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the irony of fate, similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a statement on the meeting, which was true on Friday, the Nottingham East Lebarist Party said, "We want these meetings to be meaningful and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Liberian party, such meetings were Friday
Unfortunately, today in most encounters the tone is not like that and the promise of a 'very good, more soft' policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It's getting more and more evident that in the Liberian party different views are not allowed, and every opinion is assessed from that point of view, it's a matter of party leadership or not.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because the colleagues I used to think of as sharing the same political views began to wait for me to take a step back, and took a position that I would never agree with -- on issues of national security or on the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a time in social networks when there's a time when elections are called to cancel, condemning central politics, saying that I'm no longer in the Liberian Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I was more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who meet each day with the flow of sexual or racist traits, but they never get away with it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said the Liberian Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer an organization that has different views, and with every movement of "insecurity" or changing the rules of the party's selection, it's getting tighter.
For the past two years I have been given a lot of advice, which called me not to fall in spirit, not to be so loud, and then with me everything will be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Liberian 32 years ago as a school student, responsible for the funeral of the government of Tetcher, which led to my teaching in the academic field, I have tried to refrain from the best state services for those who need them more than anything else -- whether it's a local resident or a government minister.
I never hid my political views, including the number of previous elections.
No one in the East Nottingham could ever get confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current direction.
For those who fought for this Friday's movement, I would like to say that if the country is directed towards Brexit, which is damaging to the household owner, the company and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and the strength of my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not a Nottingham Momentum, it's my electors, or it's gonna be members of the libertarians, or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to the cancellation of the elections will be and the political opportunity will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Air-Melrous 38 - 17: Invincible Air on top
Two recent attempts may have said a few final results, but, no doubt, Air deserved a victory in this strangely interesting tennis championship match.
Now they're representing a tournament table, one side with ten.
Finally, it was their highest protection, as well as their best chance, which their masters had made, Coach Peter Death's death had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Kristy of Melroves said, 'Give the proper Air, he has dared more than we do.'
The 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Klim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland's cap Rory Hughes, which was obtained for the Warriors' game, allowed Melroves to hang the numbers, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
The climate extended Eiro's leadership with the help of the Penitentiary, before, right at the stop, he killed, and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 Eiro at the stop.
But Melrows had well begun the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted into a Bugot, had shortened the distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious trauma by Ruard Nott, which was stretched out, and after re-starting Air went further through the attempts of Stafford Mcdawell, realized by the climate.
Air, carrying out Captain Blair Mcferson's duties, got a yellow card, and once again Melrows forced another man to pay with the unrealised attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of the summer pressure.
However, the gentlemen returned, and when Stroen Hutkinson got a yellow card for what he had kicked the air off with no ball off the fine line, McFersson landed behind the air.
The climate realized its attempt, which it did almost again after the re-start, after Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong in the fine and sent the flanger Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field's masters.
A Still Game star, like ready for a new career in a restaurant business
However, the star game Ford Kieran is going to enter the hotel business industry after it became clear that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes, and he's filming with a former friend Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the next nine series would be the last in the show series, and it seems Kernan plans to go on after Kreelig.
According to the official records, he's the director of Arigermorn Limited.
Actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun's source said that Kernan was hoping to participate in the "flowering trade in the Glass".
"Our Sea": Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Maracas are patrolling the military headquarters in La Pase.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In the military-martial bases from the Titicaca bridge to the Amazon, the "Mororor is our right".
Restoration is our duty.
In all Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of the shoreline lost by Chile in a bloody conflict since the resources of the 19th century, still alive, as well as the attempt to swim back into the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached the maximum peak in the last ten years, because Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the international court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Ballyia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, she is waiting for a positive result," said Balivian diplomat Robert Calsadilla.
Many praisers will be watching for the decision of the MS on large screens across the country, hoping that after decades of tension in the Hague, the tribunal will support Bolivia's declaration that Chile is obliged to give talks about bringing Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia who is facing a rival struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court can't or will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and that's a little bit of a change, even if he does.
The AAN organization, based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide on Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
What the International Court of Justice's ruling comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered, to prove that the case was "not complex," said a Chilean expert in the field of international law outside Zarat.
And far from pursuing Bolivia's affairs, the last four years may have left her back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been manipulated by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her words, the knightly knight Maralez lost the residual Chilean well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged letters.
Former President Edward Radriges Velte, the representative of Bolivia in Gaza, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia took the "excellent opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of 139 years has been revealed with mutual imagination," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Maralez, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the sea as a political resistance.
"Balvia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until they can trust the U.S.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ry Yong Ho says his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapon until he can trust Washington.
Rio delivered on Saturday at the AAN General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit in Singapore among the leaders.
His comments come as the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey appears to be at the point of revitalizing a nuclear tupical diplomat with North Korea Kim Chen and more than three months after Singapore.
Riya says it's a "necessary dream" to continue sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the war in Korea once put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Phenyan doesn't start major steps after disbanding at first.
And Kim, and US President Donald Trump need a second summit.
But there's a great skepticism on the other hand, that Phenyan is serious about refusing the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
On Parisian fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive main strips on the way to shopping in your cities
If you want to zoom in on your hat collection or close the sun, you can no longer search.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's designers presented a series of extraordinary masterpieces for their SS19 collection, which surpassed the Paris Fashion Week.
In this summer, Instagram took the popularity of non-practice hats, which were sent by designers to the building.
Valentino's remarkable figure was a luxurious coastal hat, decorated with broad fields, similar to the feathers that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of an unusually large size included carved with precious stones of cotton, a hat of wizards and even pineapple, but they were not meant to keep their heads warm.
However, Brown also showed a set of wise masks -- just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were covered with lips and were more like Ganibal Lekter than the high fashion.
One of them mentioned a boat for underwater swimming with a tube and a caulking eyelid, and the other was similar to the molten cone of the frozen.
And if you continue to adhere to the vast attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who look at style predict that huge hats can take place in our everyday life.
The hats of a huge size go five to La Bomba, a hairy hat with two-foot poles, which can be seen in all, from Ryan to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was loose in social networks, sparked another large figure on the floor – a salami beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed in the buyer.
The dark-orange raffie bag, decorated with a raffie account and covered with a white leather handle, became an excellent part of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on Weekly Fashion in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer showed great influence, and it would be hard to ignore attempts at non-profit accessories."
John Edward: Language management is a necessary habit for all citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have achieved academic success, which has continued since 2018 with another excellent outcome of the exams that are underpinned by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community beginnings.
More than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS) strive to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to train their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and eradicate an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in the language he understands, it stays in his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a bright reminder of what we can't expect just in English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the latest exams this year, we see that languages take the first place in league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students reached higher class A in Chinese, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those who were Spanish, also reached level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages such as vital skills that are undoubtedly needed for children and young people in the future.
Now languages as a subject are selected as such as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
The survey carried out by the United Kingdom Employment and Practice Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers had difficulty in filling vacancies were associated with language skills.
So more and more language skills become the need to prepare young people for future careers.
In view of the more promising workplaces that require language learning, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
No matter who takes the profession, if you learn another language, it will be a real advantage in the future if you have such skills for your whole life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person first among competitors.
According to a survey by YouTube, which involved more than 4,000 adult British people in 2013, 75 percent failed to speak well enough in a foreign language to lead the conversation, and the French was the only language in which the two-digit rate was 15 percent.
That's why investment in learning languages is now important for modern children.
The availability of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland every school will be distinguished by the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will be able to teach languages that are most important to Britain in view of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice from several languages with a textbook, which is a specialist in this field.
The Scottish independent schools are trying to ensure an environment of learning that will drive children and equip them with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages still have a vital value for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be viewed as “the skills of international relations”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and advantage to young people in Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts Sunday in San Diego
The beginning of the waiting for supporters who want to see Lebron James make his first launch at Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach Luke Waltan announced that James was playing at the pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But for how many minutes he plays, you still have to determine.
"It'll be more than one and less 48," Waltan said on Lakers' official website.
Correspondent Lakers Mike Trudel wrote that James would probably play in limited minutes.
According to the practice that came this week. James was asked about his plans for six pre-season graphics.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
West Virginia Trump Time, YouTube channel
Tonight at Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins many of the company's activities.
This is the first of the five planned talks of Trump next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When confirming the vote on the election to fill the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When does the Trump talk begin tonight in West Virginia and how do you view it on the Internet?
The trampa show in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 o'clock in the evening. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the trampo show in West Virginia on the Internet below in the direct effigy on YouTube.
Trump, more than anything, this week will consider hearings on the candidacy in the Brett Cavano Supreme Court, which has problems with the opportunity of charges in sexual claims with pending confirmation in the Senate of a weekly vote during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to give help to the Republicans who are standing before the November election.
Thus, President Tramp's company announced that the following week, these five speakers were directed to "activise the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states, since we are entering the tense pre-election season," said Reuters company representative of Trump.
As planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wilingo, today's action can attract adherents from Agao and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media," The West Virginia Metro News reports.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the issues.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris that the president has to come to try to give him a kick in the question," said Simon Hedar, a pilot at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Kubak Ryder 2018: United States Command is moving to fight to preserve hope for life on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday, perhaps it was precisely what this Ryder Cube needed.
It's a highly developed sports concept in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than comparably.
So where would they say impulse now?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now they have four, so I think we're going through it with a little impulse," Jordan Spyt said, walking for the day.
The advantage of Europe is, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spitch says, feel that they have easily picked up the wind, and they have what they expect, not least, because of the shape of Spyta and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Spyt was mortal from football to green and was an example.
These shrill cheers of celebration became more and more loud as a round took place, and he struck a decisive blow to play the match on four fields, when they and Thomas had come two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win the 15th match, was met with a similar cry, like that that tells you that he thinks the American team is not off.
"You just need to get deeper and worry about your own match," said Spicia.
Each of these players has already gone.
18 take off to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have gotten more points than Spyt and Thomas are French Maliners and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Cube Ryder.
Strange but magical couples in Europe four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Maliwood" was the only couple who did not make gods on Saturday, on the second half of the day, but they also escaped gods on the Saturday morning, on Friday and on the second half of Friday.
It happens, and as their energy seems to flow to this stormy crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are the players that will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Flethwood or Molinars.
Wanted both at the same time in different holes.
The talk about European fame remains a matter of time.
Bob Watson and Web Simpson did a brief work on Sergei Garcia, the hero of the early furquet when he was in pairs with Alex Norren.
The gods and two twins on the previous nine poured out the Spanish and Swedes to him, with which they could not get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
After the match of four balls and four, it's so interesting to observe carefully because of the interaction between the composition of the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't perform, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has thus become a better team and has played a major role in the last days, but at this fourth session it is also shown that the US team is trying to combat, which some have questioned, especially in the States.
Europe comes to the end of Cube Ryder with a number of 10-6
Europe will have a good advantage in the last day of Cube Ryder after it comes out of the four-ball Saturdays and four-balls with 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fltwood and Francis Malinars set out to fight two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results of Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Byrne, trying to save the battles they had lost in Hazeltin two years ago, was a lady in an American agency of unsatisfaction in the morning, getting a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more opposition to the match of four balls, winning two matches, but they could not do more.
To save the battles, Jim Furick's side needs eight points out of 12 single matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in the castle, and he and the Mollinars who got the name Molliwood after the sensational exits are the only two couples who won four points for their first four matches in the history of Cube Ryder.
Breaking Woods and Patrick Red into four balls, they were wonderfully strong enough to beat down Woods and the U.S. recruiter Brian Decombe five more and four more.
Woods, who was running through two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash of lightning, but now he lost 19 out of 29 times in the matches four balls and four and seven gears.
Justin Rowes, resting on a four-ball x match, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in a four-ball match to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki -- occupying one and the other place in the world.
Europe had not had its way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day to the south from west to Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time top winner of Jordan Spythe and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for Americans at two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Puller from Spain in a four-ball match and came back later to win Puller and Rory Macylroy 4 and 3 in four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Cube Rider team returned from a four-point deficit, which goes alone, although for Furick's owners it was only necessary to paint to save the battles.
But after the next two days, which were the best, Sunday's counterattack looks like they got everything.
North Korea says "no way" won't be disbanded in one way or another without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday the United Nations continued to impose sanctions on the US, and under such conditions the country could not refuse nuclear weapons on its own.
The Rio Yun Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Body that last year North Korea took "significant measures of good will", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test zone and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"At once we don't see the right answer from the United States," he said.
"Without trust to the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way of disarming itself in the first place."
Despite the fact that Ri republished ordinary North Korean complaints against Washington's "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded as it took step by step, his application proved significant in that he did not reject the unilateral declaration of denuclearization made by Phenjana in the past.
Ri made a joint statement by Kim Chen Yn and Donald Trump in his first history as president of the United States and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the road to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, with this Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has declared that Phenyan must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call to cancel severe international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
"The United States of America initially insists on "denomination" and increased pressure levels with sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, and even protests against "the end of war," says Ri.
"Respecting that sanctions can put us on our knees -- an incessant dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the duration of sanctions deepens our confidence."
Ri didn't mention plans at the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Chief of Staff noted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Mun Jain, over the past five months, and added, "If the issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not become such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he spoke at AAN General Assembly stated that the goal of the U.S. contingent with North Korea's missile was inevitable after "Mr. President Zla" Trump called Kim "a rocket" suicide.
This year in AAN Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but said that there would be much more to do, and sanctions should remain in force until the North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump announced that he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue in AAN. The Security Council stated that Phenyan should be rewarded for the measures taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the AAN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be actively and necessarily continued until we are sure of complete, final and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council reinforced sanctions in relation to North Korea in 2006 to try to stop financing the Phenyana nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri in the colors of the Security Council. The General Assembly then announced that in the following month he would visit Phenyan again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In June he left Phenyan, declaring that the progress achieved from North Korea over several hours of speaking ended with the visa declaration that he met the demands of "like the gangsters."
In this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea was about to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex when the United States took "relevant measures".
The Trump said that Kim's "relevant measures", which he's waiting for, is a guarantee of security and the attempt to normalize relations with Washington, which the Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking the right rest.
The new Harvard University course this year should teach students more sleep, and it's my goal to fight with culture to study with a coffee in your hand.
A scientist has come to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to properly look after themselves and their health.
Charles Chester, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist hospital named Brigam and a female hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
Inspired by the speech about the influence of sleep failure on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why did they just tell me this right now, at the last lesson?"
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep -- it surprised me," he said The Telegraph.
For the first time in this year, the course taught by the student explains why good sleep habits promote academic and sports achievement and also improve the general attitude.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health care at the University, said that the university decided to take a course after finding that students were often out of sleep for a week.
A course that takes an hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there's an image of rooms on the Internet where students click on cubes with coffee, lanterns and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects sports indicators as well as the importance of the habit before sleep.
At the next stage, the participant is told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A compass map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their lives everywhere.
"We know that it doesn't change students' behavior any more.
But we think they have to know it as well as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health," said Professor Chesler.
According to him, nightlife culture still exists, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students lead to sleep deprivation, which is becoming more and more difficult.
"A secure adequate sleep of good quality must be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, depression and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid the wrong weight, because sleep deprivation makes the brain permanently hungry."
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop a course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on the compass.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all Ass subjects to complete a similar education program before going to university.
Professor Chesler recommended that the student set a clock to know when to sleep and when to wake up, by noticing the bad effects of the blue light, which is changing from screens of monitors and light bulbs, which can change the living mode, leading to sleep problems.
"Livingston" 1:0 "Rangers": Manga kills Gerard's target.
Rangers suffered one more time when Dolly Mangy's goal was to make sure Steven Gerard won't get one 1:0 at the Lionstown Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to a 4-1 victory in February in St. John's, but the Harry Holton team is already taking the second time as a manager of 18 games to leave on its side eight points, departing from the leaders of the first-generation Ladbrokes Hearts.
Manga hit seven minutes before the stop, and the Rangers, inspired by the noise, didn't look as if they were suffering at once.
At the same time that Rangers are dropped in sixth place, Lionston took the third place, and they are left with the differences in balls.
For Rangers there may be additional problems after the foreward of Colum Spence should be treated from the trauma of his head after the matter had been thrown out of the Tribune.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, so that Ira did not play in the semifinals of Bethfred's Cube.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under 11 rooms, which allowed to pick up the item from Hearts last week, and was thrilled by how well they at every step passed their opponents.
Rangers had more control of the ball, but Liechtenstein had made more attempts to kill the ball.
They must have been killed in two minutes when Mengy first pointed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's door, and then the half-breeder took this chance.
The successful criminal blow of Jacobs Caegan sang of Craig Halket's capture, but his partner for the defense of Alan Litgo's was able to bring a strong blow back.
Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game, they were more hoping to kill than they were showing a good game.
Alfred Marrelas certainly had to be punished for a quarter of an hour until the end when he and Stephen Loveles met in the field, but Judge Steven Thompson did not accept Colombia's complaint.
Rangers managed to hit the gate just in the first half of the game, but there were the locks of Eibrox Liam Kelly barely gave the goal of Lassan Kubibali and the effective attack of this Echiria.
Although killing the first target at 34 minutes of Levi, it might have been against the next active game, but no one denies that they have to show a notable good game.
Rangers couldn't break Jacobs' gate again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave after Scott Robinson, who blocked Mango to get the chance to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced Kulibali's stop at Ryan Kent, and it showed an effective effect when attacking Marrelas, but impressive Kelly ran and locked up the blow.
But Lionston continued to satisfy visitors by playing this game, which was what they liked, and Litgos and Halket continued to share the ball after a long struggle.
Side Holt was able to prevail only in the last few minutes, but McGregor was playing well to resist Jacobs's before the Litgams went to bed with the spares.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton took place in a row once after the penalty was fined when he confronted Jacobs, but Thomasan managed to get away.
Almanac: Geiger's inventor.
The page of our Sunday morning album: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and PADLICI today... the day of the future physicist Iagan Wilgelm "Hans" Geiger, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that resulted in the appearance of a device known as the Geiger numerator.
Geiger became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950s called "Karanado", in which those who participated seemed to be the malady scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "It's the Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put your headphones on, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that give radioactive activity in minerals."
Evans said, "Tell me, is this really shaking right now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new advanced vaccine can help the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new anti-inflammatory vaccine can help the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine, however, teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method predicts getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then cells can see the cells that are distributed in many cancer cells, and then re-enter the cells.
The test vaccine demonstrates the success of patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced to a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells has seen that egg cancer disappears for 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so they can see the HER2 protein, which is common to many cancer cells, and then being re-introduced.
Professor J. Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Betesse, Maryland, our results show that there is a very predictable vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that are struggling with cancer of small bees, ovaries, light and thick cats," said Professor Berazofski.
A similar approach to identifying immune cells in patients and teaching them to reach cancer cells worked well during the treatment of lacquer.
The West horse began to discuss in support of Trump, bearing the title MAGA, after he appeared in the Sl.
That didn't turn out well.
In a study on Saturday evening, Kane West was humiliated after the speech he was praising the United States. President Donald Trump said he would fight for the second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening called "City of Preved", when he was in the title "Make America Big Again", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the whites, and they say, 'How can you support Trump, he's the racist?'
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with the main role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star was relying on Brett Cavano's statements before the Senate's court-martial when it came to dealing with the sexual violence of Christina Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, the West's words fell into the frame and were loaded into social media comics by Chris Rock.
I don't know if he tried to say goodbye to the West.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They thanked me for the bullets.
They said, "Do not go out with this.
They thanked me.
"And then they say I'm in a dead spot," he said, as the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued: Do you want to see the moving space? 'Speaks he's wearing my Sperman's hat, which means he can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least twice the hearing was taken off, and the U.S. representatives were confused with Veraita's message.
West was adopted as replacement for the singer of the Aryan Grande, whose boy had been a rapper, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West was surprised by the performance of many songs I Love It, dressed in a bottle of water perrier.
West received support from the CEO of the Conservative Party of TPUSA, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But the leading show-to-show Karen Hunter wrote that West was just who he was, and it was always wonderful.
"But I've decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his "arts", which I think embraces and distorts the ideology that harms my spouse.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Before the show the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he's "officially called Kane West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed Grandpa, also known as Puff Daddy.
His colleague Snoop Dog's rapper was called the quality Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music, which changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, earlier known as a prince.
Trying to kill Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he was attacked on Friday in the restaurant on the eastern part of Belfast.
The incident took place in Balihacomor, as the police report.
It is expected that the accused will appear on Monday in court in Belfast.
The charges will be dealt with by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Great Thrones star, Keith Harrington, caught the idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his waving sword and John Snow's role in the series "Golden Tables" in the Middle Ages of HBO
But the 31-year-old actor got a stereotype of a hero match, which means young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Culture Department, Keith said that he thought that "something had happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
The whale, who recently married his neighbor on the Golden Thrones, Rose Leslie, who was also 31 years old, admitted that she had the power to solve this problem.
"I feel like a strong guy myself -- when we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, from the point of view that we see now?"
The whale thinks that television must be responsible for being brutal because of very male characters.
He continued: "What lies at the beginning, and why teach it?
Why teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real man?
I think it's really one of the biggest issues in our time -- how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that something happens to young people.
In an interview he also admitted that the next summer the series will end, and he will leave the field of battle of the series and will not make dosqueals or squeals to the "Golden Thrones."
From November Kit begins to rebirth the True Western Sam Shapard, who is the historic director with his brother, who is a slave.
A recent actor said that he considered meeting with Rose's wife the best chance to finish the Thrones game.
"I met my wife in this show, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The Rose played the Ygritte, a character in love with the hero Keith John Snow in this fantastic series entitled "Emi".
In June 2018, a couple were married to Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusion.
"The number of people infected with HIV infection by blood transfusions has been reduced to almost zero," said Chinese officials at a conference in the capital of June.
With each year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is a major problem for LGBT-supply China.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has so far been eliminated.
Because of the country's conservative value, about 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are spread out of insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Government of China has been providing universal access to HIV drugs in its efforts to solve this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the angry, dangerous and theoretical terms of her parliamentary colleagues
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dropped the charge on Saturday that her co-worker posted personal information about three U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that there are claims to have high wing participants and their sites.
"A lie, a lie, and a lot of disgusting lies," says Waters on Twitter.
The published information, reportedly, includes home address and phone numbers in the United States.
The information posted by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during the hearings of the Senate's commission on sexual charges in relation to a member of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Cavano.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and provided information to the Waters team," Hel said.
"This unwarranted claim is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"The member of my team, whose data, personal information and security have been compromised by these horrific and false accusations, has not at any time been responsible for the escape of this information.
It's an unfounded assertion that's completely false and absolutely false."
The call for Waters quickly called for criticism on the Internet, including the number from the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Flasher.
"It's a rejection of anger," wrote Flasher.
It's to prove that she has no courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone accuses them of not doing it, they shouldn't be angry.
They mustn't behave rudely.
They must not question the cause of their accusation.
They must be calm and kind.
The Flasher compared the Waters reaction to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Cavano when they were accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is fighting and participating in the interlocutory elections, also said on Twitter.
"It's a resonance, if it turns out true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again hits the invented spy of Rowan Atkinsan.
Now it's a tradition to look for the sense of BRITISH in any new movie with a British angle, and this angle seems to be in Johnny English comedy and ex-French, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and went on in 2011 called "John English Counseling".
Can the satire well express itself to how much nonsense we seem to seem to be talking about the new export possibilities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things--his name was louder than any comical creature he had made for non-English viewers in cinematography.
Of course, he is a secret agent, who, despite his wise claims on the glamorous, got a little like Clouseau with Mr. Bin's features and a little like that of a guy who brought one note into the Horn of Fire at the opening ceremony in London in 2012.
Originally his character was based on the vantage point and international secrets of Atkinsan, who once played in the forgotten Barklecard, leaving chaos on his way.
Here are a few pleasant moments that were not before.
I loved Johnny English, who was approaching the helicopter, dressed in the middle of the day's success, and the trolleys of the rotor were a little beating on his helmet.
Don Atkinsan's theatrical comedy is a bright demonstration, but the humor is weak, and so it's strange when serious movies, such as "Agent 007: Mission Unexecutable" are definitely offering comedy as a major part.
The humor feels as if it were not only for adults but also for children, and even for senseless accidents Johnny English isn't as inventive as the silent Atkinsan films in the person of Bin.
Many years ago, these are the serious problems of Britain.
Cyber-Hacker penetrated a super-secret community of British spies in Britain, opening up the names of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint the civil agent -- unfortunately, the small role of Kevin Elden.
It's the last drop for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed-up actor, who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this Quezi-Terezay-May, but there's nothing in the script.
Her intelligence consultants report that since every true spy will be discovered, she will have to activate one of those who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English himself it's all complicated: now he works as the sixth teacher in several chess institutions and teaches how to be an uninvited operator: some good examples here because English offers the Academy of Music lessons.
English returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and joined his former multi-year friend Bo, whom Ben Miller has played again.
Presently because my marriage, tied to the commandant of the underwater boat, whose role Vicky Pepperdin was doing a little empty.
Thus Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Kurilen.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister gets a dangerous order from a charismatic technical billionaire who says he can solve problems with the hackers of the United Kingdom: with the famous Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their ex-cons from the immediate things: disguise under the officer, burn the French restaurant; create a riot, fight with smugglers on board the luxury yacht of Volta; English makes clean anarchy, because it tries to use the furniture of virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of Walt's house.
All the moments are drawn for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, where there are quite a lot of kids on TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how about other movies about Johnny English I couldn't think of: couldn't the British cinema industry give Rowan Atkinsan the role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Liberian Party rejects the development of a plan to pay British people four-day workweek with a pay rate of five days.
Jeremy Corbin's work party should consider a radical plan when the British only work four days a week, but they pay for five.
It's reported that the party wants corporate managers to report the results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an additional day off.
It was clear that employees would enjoy three-day outputs, but they would still get the same reward.
The source indicates that the idea corresponds to the economic program of the party and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
Since then, professionals have approved a four-week transition as a good way to make use of a change in the economy.
An older source in the Liberian Party told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen right now, but a four-week work week is an idea that fits into the party's view and a general business strategy to regulate the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Liberian Party is not the first to endorse this idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-week working week during its 2017 general election.
However, the Liberian Party's efforts are not supported at all.
A representative of the Liberian Party said: "Four-hour working week is not a party policy, and it is not a party.
Chancellor John McDonald used a working conference last week to express his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said he decided to return the power from the "inviolent directors" and "managers" to the joint ventures.
The Secretary-General's plans also provide that the current shareholder of water resources may not get the entire stock package back, as the Liberian government may make a "call" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that he was planning to join the company's advice and create a pooled property fund to transfer 10 percent of his own funds to a private firm that would keep annual dividends up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Grem, John Kennedy's release for "60 minutes," which the FBI that is working with Cavano has to change his mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano has rejected the final vote on his election to the Supreme Court at least once a week.
In an interview with Epherus on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about "Sense," whether the FBI could reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from the Queen of the South.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, going to courtroom: I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after how it happened, and I asked him why the charge was made, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive and unique."
The Grem's vote, however, seems final.
"I think Brett Cavano has decided that this will be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett firmly rejects it," added Graham, referring to Christina Blaise Ford.
"And all whom she calls could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Civilian Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, there's an International Festival: the annual music show, which has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and my mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizen's Festival will take place on the big bench of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendez's concert, and learn about the real goal of meddling -- to stop poverty and reaping by 2030.
The 2012 International Civil Society Festival is the duration of the Global Project against the Harp of an International Propaganda Group, which hopes to end poverty at the expense of increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for mermaids (if you don't want to pay for VIP tickets), visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "action" to be a valet, to write by e-mail to the country's leader, to call any other actors and to raise awareness of the purpose of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civilian Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free concert in a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicking" -- people feel that they're doing the right thing by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, festival organizers have reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded by their supporters to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to push influential leaders to meet their responsibilities for more than $37 billion, which can affect lives more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on liabilities and reported at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds secured so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnership with investors and performers based in the United Kingdom, "helping children to develop fully," promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eliminate social injustice in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that, after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken, which were called on in Britain to improve food for materials and children, the government announced funding for the food aid project, reaching 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The global festival replied: "This will be a long and difficult path; sometimes we will have to endure at once and right.
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we're going to be successful because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Jeanelle Monae, is one of the number of individuals who have been involved this year in New York City, who will lead Deborah Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US WMS can be used for "blocks" to prevent exports of Russian oil and gas
"Washington may, if necessary, address the military-martial fleet to prevent the release of Russian energy in the EU market and the Middle East," said US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are the basis for a study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to buy energy just as much as in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the factor, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability to ensure the openness of the maritime waterways by means of a military fleet, and, if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy is not likely to hit the market," he said.
Zinke turned to mer company participants organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group that positioned itself as the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more and less balanced and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia a "one-sided country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These applications were made at a time when the trampo administration wanted to significantly increase the exports of its confused natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials of the Tromp administration, including US President Donald Tramp himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "wrong" project of the North Stream 2 newspaper, which, according to Trampu, turned Berlin into a "foul" Moscow.
The Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 newspaper cost 11 billion dollars, which is being created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is starting in the economy and is an example of uncompromising competition.
"I believe that we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rikum Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans were hit in response to Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German organization representing industry, the Federation of German Developers (BDI) called for the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral relations between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Developers (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her participation in the 2020 presidential elections very seriously, says Senator from Massachusetts
The senator of the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that he would seriously consider his participation in the election of the president after the interim election.
During a talk in Mary Hallioqui, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and order our unsuccessful government, and I'm also talking about women in the highest places," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take very seriously the opportunity to speak to the president."
During Mary Warren's speech, he turned to President Donald Trump, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm extremely worried about what Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidacy in the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano.
On Friday, Warren wrote in his tweet, "Of course, before the vote is necessary for the FBI to carry out an investigation."
However, the results of the polls published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters did not believe that it should be fought by the president in 2020.
According to a survey conducted at the University of Safalk/Bostan Globe, 50 percent of the "possible" voters of Massachusetts said the senator should not fight.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed much support for former Governor Devil Patrick, where 38 percent were for and 48 percent were against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats who had discussed the potential roundup in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Agreedly the Associated Press Byden stated that he would officially take a decision until the summer.
On departure in support of Donald Trump Sarah Palin's post-traumatic syndrome, Trak Polin's syndrome
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after calling for service in September.
On Monday evening he was arrested and he was accused of domestic violence
"What my son is going through after his return, I can compare with the results of the post-operative syndrome and injuries that our soldiers are returning to other families," she said when she was leaving in support of Donald Trump in Talse, Oklahoma.
Polin called this arrest "a painful question" and said that her son, along with other war veterans, "returns a little bit to others, hardened, returned with the question of whether there was the respect for which soldiers, airplanes, and other soldiers fought for, giving themselves over to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wassil, Alaska and he was charged with domestic violence against women, preventing an attempt to report domestic violence, carrying weapons in drunken state, according to information from Dan Bennet, president of the police department of Wassil.
18 states and the District of Colombia support the prevention of a new port policy
Eighteen states and the county of Colombia support the prevention of a new U.S. policy, which refuses to press charges at the port of the victim from the gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and districts of Colombia had an analytical note on Friday in Washington to support the policy-making of the port, NBC News reports.
The full name of the case in Grace's case against Seshns, which was opened in September by the American Union on civil rights against federal policy, was not revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and his friends with a hard band" had raped her, but the US authorities refused on 20 June at the dock.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers who support Greece described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which makes the largest number of requests for landing in the United States, as countries with serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US port policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed immigrants without documents that were victims of domestic violence to address the port.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Reisin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, country and world experience".
"Federal command requires that applications at the port be based on concrete facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," says an analytical note.
Lawyers have also stated in a note that a policy that rejects immigrants is making the US economy worse, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "make the necessary jobs".
Attorney-General Jeff Seshness ordered the immigration judge in June no longer to give the port to domestic violence and gang violence.
"It is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political views," said Seshns on 11 June, announcing this policy.
The harbor never meant solving the problem, even all the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
The desperate rescue work in Paul. During an attempt to find survivors, the number of survivors has doubled.
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
“It’s all very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother of Rhys Kusum, struggling with her little son’s temperature at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palau.
"Every minute the car "quick" brings the body.
Pure water is very small."
The lodgers began to return to their ruined ladies, taking care of the cloudy things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 balls were overfilled.
Some of the wounded, including the number Two Harris, who broke the caller and his shoulder, are outside Paul's army hospital, where patients are being treated in the street because of the repeated strong kicks.
In his eyes were tears as he remembered the feeling of strong underground racing in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to fight.
I was silent under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had come to town for marriage.
"I heard a woman call for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of threats using propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily, praising the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
In the past Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the Chinese Daily Supplement to the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Ayava, after having accused China of trying to get involved in the US Congress elections on November 6th.
Tramp's accusation that China tried to get involved in the U.S. elections indicated that the U.S. officials in the name of a new phase in the conversation with Reuters in Washington under pressure in China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have launched a trade war, which has resulted in the reciprocal imposition of import tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts, were introduced to harm an exporter like the leaders of the state of Iowa who support the Republic of Trump.
Terry Brandt, the US Ambassador to China and Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, reported that Beijing had been injured by American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in the author's article on the Sunday Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts by printing advertising in our free press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press, printing a paid advertisement at the Des Moines Register,” Branstead wrote.
"And if you look at the newspapers in Beijing, there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see the real reflection of other views that the Chinese might have against a dangerous economic trajectory, taking into account the fact that the press is under the Iron Fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers has refused to offer" to print his article, although he didn't even mention it.
Republics are pushing women-electorate out of prior intermediate choices from the Qavano community, warning analysts
While many well-known republics defend candidates for the position of Supreme Judge Brett Kavano in front of a number of allegations of sexual violence, analysts warned that they would get hit in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most of the Republicans have already shown themselves ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Reicher, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University of The Hill for the article, which was printed on Saturday.
The speaker said that he was not sure that Senator Jeff Fleke's statements on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karyn Jean-Pier, chief adviser and national president of the Progressive Group MoveOn newspaper from Washington, Columbia.
On Friday morning, protestors called for November to be executed quickly. During the demonstration at the Senate Hall, when the Republicans that are in charge of the legal committee decided to remove the candidacy of Kavano, despite the application by Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be extremely great," said an independent political analyst at St. Rottenberg.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women electorate in gardens and young electorate from 18 to 29 years of age, who don't even like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before Ford's candidacy was opened, in which she detailed her allegations of candidacy in the Supreme Court in sexual violence, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there may be a strong blow in response.
"For the Republican Party, it has become a mix," said Michael Stell, who was the head of the National Republican Party Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or about the final vote, or about the fact that Cavano is on the ground. It's about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they put it to it," notes the New Channel by Hay Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats.
However, it's like the Americans have split up on the question of the law of Ford or Cavano, with a little bit more speaking than the last.
A new survey by YouTube shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or not to trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said that they are sure or not to trust Kavana.
In addition to this 38 percent said that, according to their opinion, Cavano may or may have collapsed in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
The F.B.R. is investigating the charges against Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Senate's Legal Committee that Cavano, when he was drunk, complained to her at the age of 17.
Ramirez argues that the candidate in the Supreme Court demonstrated her genitals at night when they were studying in Eile in 1980.
World Wide Web Founder plans to start a new Internet to create competition for Google and Facebook
This Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, launches a platform that will become Facebook, Amazon and Google's competitors.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows the user to choose where to store the data and who has access to it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant “the world’s rule.”
"You have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic moment."
This program uses Solid technology to allow people to create "their own Internet storage" or POD.
This may contain a list of contacts, mailing lists, calendars, banners and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available all at once on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to any type of information.
The company calls it "personally strengthening the potential by means of data."
According to John Bruce's executive director, the idea of creating Inrupt gives companies the opportunity to report together resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Lei, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, a number of developers working on the contract project, and quality evaluators.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Ley said he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change if all their business models were reviewed instantly.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday's publication on Media Burners-Lei, the Inrupt mission "is to ensure commercial energy and the ecosystem for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new solid network."
In 1994 Berners-Ley transformed the Internet, creating the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Ley has been very influential in promoting network neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Li will become the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Network, the Network Fund and the Institute of Open Data.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the network," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: honoring a pastor who was awarded the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only saint of the Church of England, who was awarded to the Church of Victoria during World War I as a combatant, was marked in his city 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Van was awarded a medal on 29th of September 1918 for his part in the attack under Bellenglis and Leakur.
However, four days later he died from the bullet of the sniper and never found out that he had received the highest military British reward.
On Saturday in the city of Rashden, the county of Nartgemptanshire, two of his grandsons on the advice opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic", that the stone was opened about 100 years after his grandfather was reborn.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion through the San Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under a strong red and bulletproof fire by the worker."
Then he ran on the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, grabbing himself with the charm and blowing out three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never have done and something worth doing."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van also set up a bride after the advice, which included the Imperial Young Archbishop of Brandwood.
Michael Van said that "for his great honor take part in the council" and added that "the manhood of a real hero was demonstrated by the support shown by many."
Fans of MMA all night waited to see Bellator 206, they instead got the lead of Pepa
Just imagine, you've been out all night looking at the packed broadcast from Bellator 206, and then you're being denied the main event.
The program with San Hase had 13 battles, including six on the main card, and they showed up in the direct atmosphere all night on the British Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gérer Moussi and Rory McDonald were on their way to catch up, looking at the United Kingdom, they were just joking when the program changed on the lead of Pep.
Some were disappointed after spending an angry night, especially waiting for this battle.
One of the Bolsheviks on Twitter called the switch to a child's mule as "some stupid joke".
In response to the question of broadcasting Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president Bellator on marketing and communication issues, he said, "The state's agreement at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and it had to be turned into a children's program."
"Yes, Pig Pepa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said that in the future they would work on a program to count British observers.
"It seems that we are considering the possibility of repeating, in my opinion, that we can resolve this issue," Koker said.
"But now the sixth morning of Sunday, and we can't decide it until Sunday by our time; it's Monday by their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and they weren't all friendly.
We've tried to solve the question, considering it's a technical error.
But that turned out to be a state decision.
I can promise you the next time it doesn't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of seizures from six to five, as we do it usually, this time we wanted to advise the fans, but we got too old.
It's the end of the situation."
"Frequent Island Discs": Tom Dale felt "little" because of sexuality
The alpine ghost jumping into the water, Tom Dale, said that growing with a sense of insignificance for others because of their sexuality -- but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not everything is like me," until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4 in the leading Laurent Lavern, he said that he supports gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this pretty old Kirsty Yang program took a few months' rest because of the disease.
In the role of the man who appeared on the island of the inhumane, in the first program of Lavern, Dale said that in childhood he felt "less" than everyone else, because "the society did not accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, "I now believe that this feeling that you are not as important as everything is was that gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "someone," he said, that he did not disappoint those who had learned about his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze performance of the album became a major LGBT movement activist and at the Societies Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he was fortunate enough to live openly without persecution and wanted to give hope to others.
A three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American scriptist, director and teacher of Dustin Lance Blake, who he met in 2013 -- "it was a surprise to me."
Dale married the owner of Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said the difference in age doesn't matter.
"When you're going through such a young age," he said, "on the first album, he was 14 years old, and after three years, his father died of cancer, he said it was hard to find a vigilante who would survive such abuses and falls.
In June they became parents, their son called Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Dale said that his perspectives had changed completely.
"If you asked me last year, I'd tell you that I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the gold of the alpine medal.
Robbie is my gold alimpic medal."
His son is also called Robert's father. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said that his father didn't accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets at the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Daily competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – jumping in water in front of my dancers in the Olympic Games, it’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also influenced the choice of a song -- the Proud of Hizer Small -- which found a clue in it in preparation for the album and from which the ants are now running.
"Discs of the Inhuman Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 in British summer time.
Mikelson, who is not in shape, remains on the bench of the Ryder reserve on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will make a record Sunday, playing his 47th match in Ryder's Cube, but he needs to return the form so that this event doesn't take place in the meantime.
Michaelson, who's going to play in this competition, which takes place once every two years, is a record 12th time, the captain of the Jim Furick team has been sitting on the bench of the reserve for the Saturday forbolts.
Instead of being in the center of the event, and he was there often for the United States team, the fifth winner of the cube divided his days between the work of the cleaner and the coaches, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the top of his career he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer is not the ideal choice for an uneasy field of Le Golf National, where they are severely punished with improper blows.
And if the field itself is not dark enough, Michaelson will win the ninth match on Sunday against the exact British Open Franciscan Muller champion who won all four matches this week together with Tommy Flettwood.
When Americans who are left at four points at the beginning of 12 single matches begin with success, the Mikkelsan match can prove extremely important.
The Führer expressed confidence in this player, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood his role today, slapped me on his back, scratched me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He is very sure of himself.
He was accepted into the Hall of Fame and gave a very much command last and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it on two matches.
I was planning more, but I was working just like that and that's how we thought we were going to play.
He wants to be in the field as well as everyone else."
Michaelson will beat Nick Fald's record by the number of matches in Ryder's cube played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Ryder's cube, which was never the same as achieving individual games.
In Mikelsan 18 won, 20 lost and seven and a half, even though Furick said his presence had brought him benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, humorous, he likes to joke about people and he's just a very good man who's good at team," he explained.
"I think that the younger players were pleased with his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the team a lot more than just playing the game."
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bearn, knows that a great break can soon disappear
Thomas Bearn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant break before individual games the last day on Ryder's cube may easily disappear.
The Dutch debuter in the 1997 Walderam match, where the European team led by Seva Balesteras had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended with a minimum advantage of 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Walderam we had a great advantage and we won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where they lost," said B'ern after viewing how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 and Friday, and yesterday, and said 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"History shows me and everyone else in the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at all one hundred.
Go out in the field and do everything right.
Until the dots appear in the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and this is an attempt to win this battle, that's what we're going to focus on.
I keep saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side there are the best players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players played on a heavy golf course, Bearn added, "I will never consider myself in this.
There will be another game tomorrow.
There will be individual games tomorrow, and that's quite different.
It's just great if you're in the field with your partner and everything's going well, but if you're playing one, here's where your real golfer's talents are verified.
That's what you have to tell the players that they have to show the best thing tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, you have to go, and you have to show the best as an individual player."
Unlike Bearne, his rival Jim Furick expects the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they had demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
The Furik himself was on both sides of these games the last day, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had the "Medine Miracle."
"I remember every word of this," he said, answering the question as Ben Crencho, captain of 1999 set up his players for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a quick start that you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the speed increases, the greatest pressure is on those who play games in the middle.
We've set up the appropriate schedule and set up the players as we liked them.
Thomas got the task of starting to play and speaking against Rory McCiller in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rawz, John Ram, Tommy Flettwood and Jan Paulter would play against the diving golfers.
"I've put my players in this order, because I think I'm gonna close it all," said Bearn about my choice for individual matches.
Start a new German warship postponed
The new WMF fleet of Germany was due to enter the line in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not appear before next year due to the inconvenient systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The Rhineland-Pfalz, a major ship of the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to get in line in 2014, but the problems that emerged after the construction prevented this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg warships, commissioned in 2007, have to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They'll be armed with powerful weapons, various anti-shipships and jet rockets, as well as with some stels technologies, such as reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods of service between telecommunications – more new frescoes can not enter their ports for up to two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern battleships – which can allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad – are ageing until they finally enter the line, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit its head last year, when the German WMF officially refused to take the ship and returned its Vervain Blohm & Voss to Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy ship returned to the ship on the shores after delivery.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media have written about many "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship empty in the battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have only 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was very important that it would reduce its productivity and limit the possibility of further updates.
The Rhineland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of the same class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of cost of the whole project, including team learning, there is also a problem.
The price reached an incredible EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) -- although it initially amounted to EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with new fractals are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is declining.
Early this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, said that the IMF "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions".
He claimed that the problem is sometimes increasing, because the old ships are listed, and the ships are not replaced.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frigates could join the WMF.
The National Monumental Society Listened to the Secret Life of Speakers
A new research conducted in Scotland's Hill, aimed at identifying how they say they use landscapes to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
The research of scientists at the National Society for Protection of the Monuments of Scotland is carried out by small bats and also by long bats of Dabanton in the gardens of Inveru in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this location to watch the storytelling activities during the season.
Society workers and volunteers will conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all the recordings to determine the frequency of speakers' calls, as well as who are told what to do.
The map and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Slave Dwear, the National Society's council on nature conservation, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of creating living places like bears and how to support the forests for the survival of bats and other animals associated with them.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and developing works that affect their places of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as sticky rods for flies and some chemicals for building materials.
I was told not to be blind at all.
But because of their nightlife, the ears spoke more audible than the eyes when talking about hunting.
They're using a complex exhalation technique to detect holes and obstacles in the flight path.
National society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the storytellers.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, check their place of residence, and sometimes save lives.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish commander of the storytelling team at the Trevors in Damfris and Galavey, where eight of the ten species of storytellers live in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's novel says it's the ideal territory for storytelling.
"Here, in Troy, we just have a great place for the speakers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about the bats yet, so our work here and in other monkeys will help us to understand more about what they need for a better life."
It underlines the importance of testing the presence of bats before the property is repaired, as one seat can be accidentally destroyed by killing 400 males and young bats that will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
The wounded are under protection and are forbidden to kill, frighten, worry or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Féral, a spokesperson for the Society in Scotland, calls on the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our stories, and we don't even know how their populations live."
Ranaldo denies charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to trial for German journalism.
Christian Ranaldo called his charges against him in the rape of Facebook news, saying that people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to trial the German journal Der Spiegel, who published these accusations.
The Forvard of the municipality of Portugal and Yventus were accused of rape by American Catherine Mayorg in the Las Vegas courtroom in 2009.
Then he would have paid her 375,000 dollars in silence, wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In the video Instagram Live, 33-year-old Ranaldo addressed 142 million of his subscribers several hours after the publication of the indictments, calling this message "faecal news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said Gold Sword's five-fold owner in front of the camera.
"They want to make an advertisement on my behalf.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
Lawyers Ranald's trial against Der Spiegel's journal on charges that have been called "an incorrect message of suspicion in a private case," reports the Reuters agency.
Christian Heart's lawyer said that the player would need compensation for "the moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
As if there was an incident in June 2009 in the luxury of the Palms Hovtel and Casinau at Las Vegas.
Having met at the nightclub of Ranaldo and Mayorgo if we had returned to the footballer's room, where he would have raped her anonymously, as written in the papers of the district court of Clarke County in Nevada.
Major says that after that, Ranald turned up and said that he was a "good guy" for 99 percent, who suffered from "one percent".
The documents confirm that Ranaldo admitted that they had sex, but they agreed.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the damage in the hospital, but then agreed to the extrajudicial arrangement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she would "publicly bring it down."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to renew the indictment now because she feels a moral trauma in that case.
In time, if there was a case, Ranaldo was going to go to the "Real" from Manchester United, and this summer he went to the Italian "Yventus", closing the deal in 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "always hurts" the loss of automobiles
The United Kingdom "will always hurt" when it loses its world-leading automobile leader after Brexit, said the minister of business, Greg Clark.
He added that he was "anxious" by Toyota UK company for BBC that if Britain left the EU without mention, the company would temporarily cut production in Bernston, near Derby half.
"We need a reminder," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer reported that a delay in the limits resulting from Brexit without mention could lead to job cuts.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant in Bernston released nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I think when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop," said Marwin Cook, Director of Toyota in Bernston.
Other manufacturers of cars in the United Kingdom raised the question of how cross-border trade will be achieved when Britain comes out of the EU without mention, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's going to close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that car builders are talking about the risk of chains of supplies resulting from Brexit without mention.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "precisely in time", when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without mention, there may be a breach on the border that will lead to a delay and a lack of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to keep the factory in Derby more than a day's spare part, the company said, so the production stopped.
Mr Clark said that the Plan of Checkers of May May about future relations with the EU was "made precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We need a memory, and we want the best memory, which not only allows us to succeed today, but also allows us to use this opportunity," he said in Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, suggests that we must be able to continue the work of successful supply chains."
Toyota was unable to report how long production would not work, but for the future warning that the added cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Covalaris, who works in Bernstone for 24 years and is the coordinator of the trade union, said that the trade union members are very concerned: "I think if the jobs are cut short, they won't recover anymore.
The government president said, "We have proposed a precise plan of our future relations with the EU that deserves confidence."
The White House says that the Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
A very important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week", while a campaign around a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, a Belgian home official said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is studying the involvement of Russia's election, the relations of Tramp's assistants with Russia, and the potential impediment to justice by the president.
Release the Trump assistant general's attorney or not, and thus put Muller's independence under threat, months of pouring oil into Washington's flames.
Early this month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Trump, and being able to get the president off the board with 25 corrections.
Rosenstein denied it.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of a rumor about what was going to fall off.
Instead, it was announced that Thursday would be a meeting with Trump, who was at the AAN headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing at the Senate's legal committee, where he spoke to Kavana and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation against Cavanaugh, which further slowed the Senate vote.
The president of Trump Sara Sanders appeared on a Sunday Fox News Sunday program.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not until the appointment, maybe this week, maybe next week.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the newest information."
Some journalists are willing to discuss her statement: Sanders didn't run press briefings in the White House on 10 September.
Leading the program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that a few briefings were called on don't look down on the TV reporters who are "working for the public", even though she said, "I remember the fact that they work for the public."
Then she said that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more to do with the answers to the press than any president who's been to him," she said, adding, without any specific facts, "We've been studying these numbers."
The briefings take place, Sanders reported, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We're trying to do this often, you've seen how we've been doing this in the last few weeks.
The trumpet regularly answers questions when it leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
The president's own press conferences are rarely held.
This week in New York, the president was showing why if he was free and sometimes extraordinarily in front of reporters.
Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in Scotland's health system before Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to an EU worker who works in Scotland's health care system to express his gratitude for the country's name and to wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter less than half an hour before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of claims made by EU citizens working in state services.
In her letter to Mrs. Freeman, she said: "The talks between Britain and the EU continued in the summer about our country's departure, leading to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government also accelerated preparation for the script without mention.
I know that for all of you this is a very restless time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU, and not only, give valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Christian Abercrombie underwent a terminal operation after a head trauma
Linebacker's Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie took over a term operation after he got a headache in a Sunday match that his team lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores team, says Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Coach Tennessee State Rod Red told the reporter that the injured player got just before the break.
"He went to the side line and suddenly fell," said Red.
The trainers and doctors gave the Abercombi oxygen still on the field before putting it on the force and moving it to fix the diagnosis.
The Tennessee State representative said Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashvili, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbellt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no "failure about what it was like," and Tennessee State was trying to figure out when the player got the trauma.
Abercombie, a second-class sportsman, runs the first season of Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full surprises, which gives a total of 18 surprises per season.
British foreign customers will pay for the bulk
According to a new conservative plan, foreign British real estate buyers will pay higher shipping costs and additional money will go to help homeless people
This action neutralises the success of the Corbin initiative in attracting young voters
An increase in the government's remit depends on those who don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Teresa May announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government mission and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative in attracting young voters, as well as providing affordable housing, which is directed at people with high income.
An increase in the government's remit is directed at individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money they get will go to the government's homeless housing program.
An increase in the current state mission, including a higher level, taken two years ago, for the purchase of other houses and a residence for hire, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of London's new constructions are bought by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to an increase in prices and a new buyer is making it difficult to buy his first apartment.
Many rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become "good-privileged" because a large number of buyers out of the border spend most of their time not living in the United Kingdom.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Barris Johnson's call to reduce the government's remit to young buyers to ease the acquisition of the first apartment.
He accused the huge construction firms of maintaining high prices for real estate by taking over the land and not using it, and called upon me to cancel the quotas on the available dwelling to repair the 'disgusting position' with the dwelling in Britain.
Master Corbin announced a series of residential reforms, including the control of the rent and the cessation of the "absolute" eviction.
He also wants to give local advice more authority in the area of housing construction.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I announced that my commitment to the position of Prime Minister for the Restoration of the British Dream -- life for every new generation must be made better.
It means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here to work and build their lives.
But it's unfair that people who don't live in Britain and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as British workers.
For too large a number of people dream of having their own home become increasingly inaccessible, and the problem of homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage the Scottish community"
Coach Sanderland Jack Ross said his main ambition was to ever become a coach of the Scottish community.
The 42-year-old Shatlandese is doing the task of restoring the club from the north east, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He went to this job in the summer, after he got back to Saint Mary's in Scotland's premier league last season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," said Ross in BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up often suffering from Scotland at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that's the chance to happen if I'm a successful club coach."
Among Rose's predecessors are Sanderland Coach Dick Advocacy, David Mois, Sam Alardois, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poie, and Paul Di Kany.
Former coach Aloo Atletik says he didn't feel afraid of such famous names in such a big club, before rejecting the proposals from Barnes and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'll be happy for me to answer the question, 'Will I be able to return this club to Prime Minister League?'
According to the structure and material base of the club its place is probably in the Prime Minister of Liza," he said.
"Not just to get him back there, but I'll consider my job a success only if I can get the club back there."
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, until then he was a assistant coach at Dambarton and worked for 15 months at Harts Train Station.
Then he helped Aloe come back from the third league and turn Saint-Mieren from a failure that almost hit the Championship in the victory next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career in Clyde, Hartulpool, Falkirk, Saint Maryn and Hamilton Academy.
Recalling his work at Aloo, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training is what I need, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing because I worked well, earned well and reached certain heights.
But the game can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I'm going through it now when you talk about stress and pressure, but training is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing this, and it's the best time for me to spend my adult life."

A study of the perfect time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer increased the arrival of British pubs struggling for survival, but brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the statistics of the pubs and bars group, sales grew by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA's advisory business group, which collected this statistics, said: "The sun's weather is growing and longer than expected, and the English community has participated in the World Championship final, which means that in June, what happened was in June, when the popes increased their sales by 2.8 percent, and the restoratives suffered even more.
The drop in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June only got worse in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks until they showed the best outcome in contrast to restaurants.
The folks who sell more food also got caught up in the sun, though not as strong as the restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, drinking grew by 6.6 percent, and food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and accommodation, said, "These results are becoming the trend that we see at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes on the public food market.
It's no wonder that restaurants continue to compete, because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when costs are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come in the worst time for operators focused on food, and the time will show whether the lower temperatures in August bring such a expected relief."
The overall growth in pubs and restaurants, including recently opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the expansion of brands.
The tool to measure sales in British pubs, bars and restaurants of Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data on productivity from 47 working groups with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is an important orientation of this sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in the networks it hides from parents
Research has shown that every fifth child -- some have only 11 -- has secret accounts on the networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of Facebook Insta pages
It's the news that's overheated the fear that there's sex content.
Twelve percent of students said they had a "basic" account that showed their parents
Every fifth child -- some have only filled 11 -- creates online accounts that keep them secret from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in Facebook Insta accounts, which would lead to Instagram's photo exchange.
It's the news that's fueled the fear that there's sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they'd have "pure" "basic" accounts to show their parents, and they'd also have private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she had called others "to rape me."
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they won't be found by their parents or teachers."
Elid Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scotland Council of Light Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as a member of the Board of Supervisors at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle, Scotland's most well-known lightweight and senior Ian Beaty, described this event as a great opportunity for sportsmen to get a lot of benefits from her experience at the most diverse levels, including the number of internationals over the past decade.
"Aylid is used with great respect in Scotland, Britain and the World Sports Association, and we are sure that a lightweight athlete in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the Council," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman's voice and I hope to help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who won gold at 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympics in the Atlantic, and two gold medals in the other Olympics, and who is now an expert on BBC, can't walk after the survival of the micronull.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I was hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it'd only take time to show if I were going to make it up to what degree.
It was hard work, but I was completely fixed, I learned to walk again and now I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for your support message."
A small pump that compares mothers to cows, shares their views on the Internet
The small-scale pump production company divided the claims by issuing an ad that compares breast-feeding women to cows that are breast-feeding.
To mark the launch of what they call "the first tiny pump put on in the world" the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music advertisement on the basis of a video to show the freedom that this device gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in a cow with cows under a song where there are the words: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it doesn't wash, it's my breast."
And she said, "Oh, come on, I feed the baby, come, come, I give my women."
However, an advertisement that was posted on Facebook's website called for a hot discussion on the Internet.
77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
As we, they must be pregnant and born to give milk, so only their children take it in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's tiny pump is unmarked in the bistigal for ruminants (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It was traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you use them for advertising a tiny pump for a mother who doesn't have children?"
Someone said, "That's an unintended advertisement."
Others defended advertising, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was fun.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I were breast-feeding.
Exhalation of milk makes me feel like cow.
It's a little crazy commercial, but I liked it.
It's a genius," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very fun advertisement directed at mothers who turn off milk pumps (particularly at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows."
It doesn't approve of advertising and does not condemn small business."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they all danced with invisible tiny pumps hidden in the busters.
The concept of advertising is based on the fact that many women who use tiny pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely idle, has no rights, no pipes and is inconceivably hidden in the bistugal for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children and even leave the house during the work of the device.
Ana Ballarin, a partner and creative director of Mother's company, observed: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and corrective start.
Leading the parallel between feeding women and baby cows we wanted to pay attention to the detachment of milk and its difficulty, while demonstrating the fun and good way that a new baby pump would take on an extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that Elvie's tiny pump is in the center of attention.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on a stand in clothes from Martha James, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children without forest noise transport into a dwelling camp on the tecnical border
Although the number of crossings in the month was almost unchanged, the number of detained children-migrants grew sharply, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and politics of the Trump administration, which made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to put their own country at risk, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased considerably in June when the federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other senior members of the household would need to drop fingerprints and data would be transmitted to the immigration body.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and bribery officer, spoke before Congress with a report on the arrests of dozens of people who were asked to sponsor minors without involvement.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had no trial.
"About 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of their homeowners are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we continue to pursue such people," said Mr. Olbens.
To speed up child treatment, officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court for a month from the date of detention, namely, according to the employees of the shelters, before the standard term was 60 days.
A large number of people who apply for their own legal status to an immigration judge will have to use video linkages instead of being present in a private court.
People who don't have any reason to be of help will be quickly deported.
According to foster workers and a message from sources in the system that have occurred in recent months, the longer the children remain in captivity, the more likely the onset of depression or the increase of anxiety may lead to the explosions of violence or the attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that in more massive institutions, such as Tarnilla, these problems are much stronger, as the signs that the child is in a bad state are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to a residential city without providing time for emotional preparation or for the development of friends can make the trauma worse, which many have already faced.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey
In return to the AAN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualam also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war that continues in the country for eight years.
Mualam, who is also the Prime Minister's envoy, said that foreign forces are illegal on the Syrian soil, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "will be viewed accordingly".
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he said at the Assembly meeting.
Mualam insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people and millions of people have died since 2011, they had to leave their homes, "the war with terrorism is practically over".
He announced that Damascus intends to continue "to carry on this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "the love of illegal foreign presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, who are mainly the instructors and advisers of the Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar Assad.
France's earthly contingent in this devastated war country is made up of more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Mualam stated that the conditions for return were favourable and charged with "some Western countries" with "spreading ironic fears" that keep refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to accommodate their return," he says.
"They are policing an exclusively humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement on the end of the war has been reached between Assad and the opposition.
The AAN diplomats report that the recent mention between Russia and Turkey of the creation of a buffer zone in the last major resistance of the Idlibe rebels created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turkey report has prevented a wide range of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualam stressed that the mention had "precise terms", and hoped that military action would be directed against the poachers, including the number of battles associated with the Al-Qaeda Front of Nusra, which would "be destroyed".
Ambassador AAN Stefan de Mistour hopes to call for the first meeting of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition to develop a post-constitute for Syria and set the way for elections.
The author stated the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the Commission's work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the existing constitution", and warned against interference.
Why does Trump go on the second term?
In this sense, Mr. Trump will win in the 2020 elections if, as many liberal observers expect, the impicence and scandal will not eventually end his presidency.
And that will certainly be "The only dramatic final of the presidency for all history!"
At this point, there is no sign of fatigue in the viewer.
From 2014, high-time ratings have grown more than twice – up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times – up to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in the spring, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the broadcast of The Rachel Maddow Show, MSNBC collected 3.5 million viewers at the screen and exceeded the ratings of cable TV in the evening when major news was broadcast.
"It's a fire to which people are drawn, because we don't understand it," says Neil Bear, director of the ABC drama "Preamnik" about the Cabinet member of ministers who become president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nellie Scowell, a scriptist comedy and author of the book "A couple of funny details and a few harsh truths about getting into a club of Hollywood boys," has another theory.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he's cheering me up," said Mrs. Scowell.
Chaos is valuable still and can be comforting.
Of course, unlike the rest of the TV, the global lines that come from Washington can become as definite a future as the Ruv v. Wade case, depending on whether the families of immigrants can unite and healthy the world economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you watch a group of experts commenting on Bob Woodward's use of "information not for printing" in the book "Strah", the short Paul Manafort for $15,000 with a strutsy skin (a suit of pride, as written in "The Washington Post"), and the consequences of the harsh descriptions by Storm Daniels, um, Mr. Tramp's anatomy, it goes beyond simply wanting to be in the course.
I will never, for example, look at Super Mary just as I did before.
"A bit of what he does makes you feel like you look at the reality of the show he demonstrates every evening," says Brant Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" about the variable acting composition of the Tramp show and the constant rotation of the subject ("sparing" with the NFL, approval by Kim Chen.
You can't let yourself skip even one episode, or you can stay away from the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fles this week, behind the windows of his house on the north coast of Kawai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees warm, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while writing CNN.
He couldn't afford it, not when Brett Cavana stood before the Senate's Court Committee, considering the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging on the wall.
"I remember kids when we released these crazy shows, and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fles.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

External cash flows flow into a rough pre-selective selection race in the representatives' room
It's not surprising that the 17th election district in Pennsylvania has closed the money market thanks to the change in the boundaries of the Congressional Districts, so that two candidates participate in elections for one place.
The recently repatriated suburban district of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Conar Lamb, who won his place in another district in the elections last spring.
Limbu is opposed to another acting deputy, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th old district of Pennsylvania, which is largely in line with the 17th.
The cards were re-designed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the study established that the voices of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted for the benefit of the Republicans.
In the new 17th district, the pre-election race led to a decline in the financing of the company by major party financial groups, the Democratic Company's CoR Committee and the National Republican Company's National Committee.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a complex victory over the wide-ranging selection of 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by the Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won the district with a 20-point break.
Political experts have little advantage over the democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of El Salvador's punishment for China's support, and then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported the position of Beijing, despite a slight opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Warel in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump leadership.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call on US leadership for diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," said President Heser Navert at the beginning of this month.
However, sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and the objective restrictions on issuing visas, would be painful for the Central American country with its high level of unemployment and homicide.
As a result of the completion of the internal meeting, representatives of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic growth, which would be a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step in efforts to prevent immigration in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration continued to understand that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped the discussion of El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pension will now attend a conference, which will be held in mid-October, in the sign that the administration is in charge of entrepreneurship.
And three American envoys with no noise returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messengers or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by three American officials, including the number of two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues while maintaining anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by another, close to the administration by analysts who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on the possible obstacle to justice by Mr. Trump, on the examples of what is currently very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Muller has taken note of the investigation into the possibility of a contract between Trump and Russia in an election attack.
When Congress changes the lord, Mr. Trump turns before the face of responsibility before this body, just as he is about to speak again before the electors, and perhaps eventually before the jury from his fellow.
There's a lot of "if" and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just as it is in Europe.
All of us, on either side of the Atlantic, have to make a choice which will determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938 the German officers were ready for the coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West ordered him to oppose and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've had a failure and let go of the possibility of avoiding the next few years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such broken moments, and the impenetrable march of democracy hastens or pauses.
Right now, Americans have faced several of these breaking moments.
What will happen if Mr. Trump releases the prisoner of Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein found himself in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote about what he had suggested last year to secretly write the president's words and consider his propriety.
Mr. Rosenstein says the translation of "The Times" is not correct.
"How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigation into the Brett Coffee case is not universal or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite the well-known trust of the accused in sexual violence and uncontested statements?
And first of all, shall we vote in elections for Congress, which will attract Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we don't go through these trials, we're going to have a long winter for democracy.
But I believe that we will not teach thanks to the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Hebrew who had been deported to Asvenci in the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my Polish house.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and after 60 years sent me to light the Saturday candles on this table with a swastika.
With such an inheritance as I can't be an optimist in relation to our future?"

Grem Dorans with Rangers is an optimistic match for Rapid Wen.
Rangers take Rapid Wen on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over the Valerreala at the beginning of this month will allow them to leave the G League of Europe.
The knee trauma prevented Greme Dorans from speaking for the first time in the 2-2 season with "Villareala", but he believes that "Rangers" can be used as a trampline.
"It was an important match for us, because "Villareal" is a strong opponent," says a 31-year-old footballer.
"We started the game, thinking we could get something, and made a point.
Maybe in the end we could have killed the ball, but in the whole night it also turned out to be a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves in hand, and we had the best half field.
There'll be another big one on Thursday for European football night.
I hope we can earn three points, but it'll be a complicated game, as they've shown a good result in the last game, but considering the crowd of observers on the tribunals, I'm sure we can handle them and show them a good game.
Last year was determined hard, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of certainty.
The command is good, and the boys really get the pleasure of the game; the workouts are productive.
I hope we can move forward, achieve the outcome of the last season and strive for success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the respondents had an accurate idea of what they wanted to care for, a few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people involved in public research reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide for Life Insurance.
That's what it's worth to start with.
Consider it with your husband and children: your family won't be ready to help you if you don't talk about your wishes in advance.
Work with the consultant and the family and consider where and how to get medical help because this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Please draw the financial consultant's attention. He can also help you to find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or you can self-insurance your life – provided you have money.
Decide with legal documents: provide court battalions.
Get maturity on medical care to assign a temporary person to control your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are carried out by specialists if you can't talk.
Besides, look at the possibility of spending your trust in financial management.
Set up a temporary person to make financial decisions and make sure you pay your bills if you are not in a position to do so.
Don't forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about prohibited medicines and the presence of allergies?
Write down these details in writing to be ready.
"They not only have a role to play in financial issues but also in medical professionalism," says Martin.
"What medicines are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned."
In Ilfracombe a man shot several times with a pneumatic pint
The man got a few strokes from a pneumatic pint when he went home at night.
The roof was 40 years old in the Oxford Grove district of Ilfracombe, the county of Devon, when he was shot in the chest, life, and hand.
Police officers described a shooting that took place about 02:30 a.m. locally as "accidental".
The patient did not see the attacker.
His injuries are no threat to life, the police ask the witness to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official figures, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indian city of Palau on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected.
Because of the disconnection of the agents involved in humanitarian aid, they were unable to obtain any information from Dongal's Regency, a region north of Paul, which is closer to the epicenter of an earthquake of 7.5 points.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after a stressful disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slovenia:
Palo is the capital of Central Slovenia, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Slovenia, with a population of 379,800 for 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunamis came, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regent that is located more than 180 miles (300 km) north-west of the island of Slovenes.
Regents are the administrative unit of lower status than the pension, with 299,200 persons in 2017.
Fisheries and rural holdings are the main economics of the Central Slavesian province, especially the Dongal coastal region.
The production of nickel is also important for the construction, but mainly concentrated in Moraval, on the opposite coast of Slovenia.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief, Paul and Dongal have suffered a series of tsunami attacks over the past 100 years.
In 1938 more than 200 people died in Dongal's tsunami, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fire ring and it is regularly rocking earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Achech Indian Peninsula on the north of Summer 26th called for tsunamis, which covered 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acheh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes took place on the western coast of Summer at the end of March-the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: an earthquake of magnitude 6.8 occurred in the south of Java, the densely populated island of Indonesia, which caused tsunamis that covered the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: In the town of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatran peninsula, an earthquake occurred at 7.6 p.m.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: an earthquake of 7,5 balls occurred on one of the Isles of Mentuai beyond Summer, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters high, which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake turned to the Regent of Posi Jay in the Acheh province, causing destruction and panic, as he reminded people of the desolation resulting from the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunamis did not come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: strong earthquakes have taken place on the tourist island of India Lambok, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without being able to leave.
Sarah Payline's older son was arrested for domestic violence in the family
Track Paline, the eldest son of former Governor Alice and vice-president of Sarah Paline, was arrested for charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Paline from Basil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted information about domestic violence and opposition to the arrest published on Saturday by the state police in Alaska.
According to the police report, when one of the acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the KTUU channel, Paline is located in the next Matanuska-Sustainable isolate under a $500 bet.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "precisely innocent," when asked whether he would acknowledge guilt, the network reported.
Pilein is accused of three crimes of Class A, which threatens to free him up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also been charged with Class B crime, which is punishable by the release of $200 a day and a fine.
That's not the first case when the charges against Paline were filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Payline, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case at present is at the trial of the Alice Veterans' Court.
In the summer of 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, reports of domestic violence and the detention of arms in a state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized for the harsh conduct of her son with post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq in 2016.

The Federal Prosecutor's Office requires a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office is charged with a death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of being a terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Soipov, 30 years old, was apparently used in October by the truck company Home Depot to ride on a bicycle road along the six Westside in Lower Manhattan, running on foot and riding bicycles on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the report of the intention to seek the death penalty in the South District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intended" eight people and "intended" caused serious bodily damage.
According to the court's material, for both violations of the possible punishment as a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal prosecution board of Ashalamil Saipov's accused of 22 counts, which included eight charges of murder for missile support; this is usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of means of transport.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required "old and intentional planning", while describing Saipov's crimes, they used such phrases as "accursed, cruel and angry."
"Syfula Habibulaevich Saipov has caused injuries, caused damage, and brought loss to his family and friends Diego Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ana Lori Decadt, Dorena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Ferruz, Erna Diego Mends and Alejandro Damien Pagnuk," says the report of intent.
Five of those who died were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last start of a criminal case with a death penalty in South New York County, it has been ten years.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug addicts, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Etel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to two years earlier for spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A couple of Rosenberg was sentenced to an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Soipov, a Uzbek man, according to court documents, demonstrated the absence of conscientious objectors in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he made a statement as follows that he felt satisfied with his student.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed the authorities that he had been inspired by a video viewer of the Islamic State on the phone to attack him.
He also asked permission to release the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room, reported to the police.
He doesn't recognize himself guilty of a conviction that consists of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipova, said they were "unsatisfied" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the solution to the death penalty, not to the life imprisonment without the possibility of liberation, is only to prolong the pain of these events for all participants," Patan said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim a death penalty.
A member of the Thora parliament says that Nigel Farague should make statements about Brexit.
Today, during the protests at the Tory Nigel Farague party, he called for "mobilizing the National Army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "taste discomfort" from European skeptics – as one of the members of the Teresa May parliament offered their candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of Parliament from the Peter Bowen Conservatory Party said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have "exited" if Mr. Faraz had taken over the estate of the Sacrator in Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs. May faced, trying to imitate her different followers, was even worse when the Tori, who are in charge of preserving EU membership, made a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister of all forces is trying to keep the Compromised Checker report under constant pressure on the part of supporters and supporters of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
Allieds insist on trying to make a deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and want to make Europeans and librarians choose between the package and the "disadvertent".
Mr. Bone said at a meeting in Salihalle "Existing" (Leave Means Leave) that he wanted to "turn Checker off the board".
He suggested that Mr. Faraday do the same and impose obligations on talks with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have gone out," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingbor added, "I'm for Brexit, but we need to get out of the Checker Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We don't make world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bowe rejected the assumption that the public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British changed their opinion and wanted to stay is not entirely true."
Brexit's supporter and a member of Tora, Andrea Jenkins was on the march, and in conversation with journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Czech plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and activists who actually go out and pick us up.
Please give up the plan and start listening."
In a sharp turn to Mrs. May, she added, "The Prime Ministers remain on the ground when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians would have to "taste discomfort" if they were going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a question of trust between us -- people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "It won't come out of your hands."
In turn, he added, "I want you to make those politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We mobilize the national army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit, and never worry until we become independent, self-sacrificed, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the exit workers went through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists were talking about Tories Against Brexit (Tori versus Brexit) banners after the group started in these outlets.
The Liberian Pierre Adanis ran over the conservators with an opportunity to deal with the security problem they faced because of the dinner program when they opened the conference.
"These people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all the technologies for Canada plus, for the limit without training, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full page.
A thing like a good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of rotating the president's throne
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after her election in November she "will pay close attention to the process of rotating on the presidency".
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts told of his future on Saturday during a general march in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a part of President Donald Trump's criticism, is going to go to re-election, to stand up to a member of the Republican Jeff Diell, who was the senior company of Trump in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of the discussion as a potential enemy of Trump in 2020.
From the time of Trump's entry into the settlement, it was already 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general east, which took place on Saturday in Halyok.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to fight for the president's seat.
Warren replied that the time had come for "a woman to go to Washington to fix a broken government, and for this to be the head of a woman."
Arrested after the death of a basketball player named Sims from Louisiana State University
The Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder of a basketball player named S.H.L.L.W.S.S.S. was arrested on Friday.
The Baton-Rose Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dietan Simpson at a press conference that took place 11 hours early in the morning.
On Friday they published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the man who was painting on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot in the morning of Friday around the campus of the University of South.
"Wide Sims received a gunshot wound in his head as a result of his death," reported reporters of the "247sports" station on Saturday, Mary J. Paul.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the Simpson investigation he confessed to being at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not oppose the arrest and was taken under guard in the police correction of the East-Bonton-Rose district.
The sportsman-young grew 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) in Baton-Rose, Sims played 32 games last season, 10 of which were on the course from the beginning, in the middle of the 17.4 minutes, delayed 5.6 points and 2.9 sets for the game.
Grant to Russia: Luis Hamilton approached the title of the World Championship after winning the Sebastian Fettel in an internal order
From that moment that Walter Botos ordered on Saturday at Luis Hamilton's qualifying company, it became clear that instructions from the Mercedes team were playing a significant role in the race.
Botos pulled out a good place on the predators and almost left Hamilton at the will of fate, until he defended his place on the first two glances and invited Fethel to attack his friend by the command.
Fetal first went to the pit-stop and left Hamilton wandering at the end of the common crowd of thugs, namely this manoeuvre had to become decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went to the Pittsburgh round later and went out behind the Fetel, but Hamilton went out after several round-a-round maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking holding after a double maneuver to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstopen on his 21st birthday began from the back row of the network and until the end of the first round was in the seventh place.
Then he led most of the race until they held the rails, for he wanted to quickly finish, swallow Kimmy Rykanen and take the fourth place.
As a result he went to the pit-step at the 44th round, but couldn't increase the speed of the remaining eight circles, so Ryan took the fourth place.
It was a hard day, because Walter all the outputs spoke fantastically and said himself a true gentleman when I was allowed to say so.
"The team has done an excellent job to take the first and the second place," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dian Finstein at a meeting on Saturday because she insisted that it was not the source of Christine Blaise Ford's escape letter, in which she accused the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Coffee in sexual violence.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the evidence for Ford before the Senate's Court Committee, instead of commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "slow, hideous and false".
"The only thing that can happen and the most beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly and false people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and escapes and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Finstein, is this your escape?
You remember her answer... you lost the document, "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I had nothing to do with it."
Wait a minute.
We let the plugin... no, we didn't,' he added, advising the senator.
Finland sent a letter in June with a detailed statement of accusations filed against the Kawan ford, and he fled early in September--but Finland denied that the escape had taken place from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her history run," said the Finnish Committee, "the Hill".
"She asked for the story to remain confidential and I answered her request."
But her refusal probably didn't like the president, who said it so during the Saturday meeting, "That's what I'm telling you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
As he continued to defend the candidate in the Supreme Court charged with three women's sexual harassment, the president suggested that the democrats use charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power to themselves by any means.
You can see the substation, the measure, and they don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to have to cross to get power and control," says President Mediaite.
Elite League: Dandy Stairs - Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Duyer killed two shows for the Giants in a match against Dondi
Dondi Storia played for the Friday defeat that Belfast Giants put on them under the Elite League, winning the back-up match with the number 5-3 in the domestic match on Saturday.
Thanks to the blow of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bawille Giants, they led on two shows in the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney equaled the number before Duyer restored the leadership of Giants.
François Busher from Dandi equaled the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen gave two voices to the winning team.
It became the third defeat in the Elite League for the season for Adam Kif's team, which won Dandi with number 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
Commands met for the fourth time in the season; in the previous three matches, Giants won.
The first goal for the fourth minute of the match (03:35) killed Dower from the fall of Kendall McFol, and still after four minutes Baville doubled the number after the fall of David Rutherford.
In the first period (13:10) Sullivan opened a number by the owners of the field, and then Koun equaled the number after Matt Markvard's transmission (15:16).
Duyer provided the Giants with leadership on his way out for the first break, killing his second brother-in-law at the end of the first period.
Taking the side, he regrouped, and the Busher re-balanced the account, killing the Shiba while he was carrying the physical command (27:37).
Coon and Charles Carcoran helped Nielsen get Dandi out of the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he secured the victory along with the fifth team number in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have already lost four out of the last five dates, are playing the last match on the domestic platform against Milton Cannes on Friday.
Air traffic controller gin, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
The airman in Indonesia was killed by a hero, providing a successful flight of hundreds of passengers aboard.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news after a massive earthquake on the island of Slovenes on Friday, which caused tsunamis.
Strong underground runs are still going on, and many people are buried under the clouds in the city of Paul.
Although his colleagues were rescued by escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his settlement on the Disciplinary Elevation, which the savage had climbed to the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained in place until the ship of 6321 Batik Air, which was then on the airfield, escaped from the ground.
Then he jumped out of the dispatching height when he decided that she was breaking up.
Later he died at the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News program, Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohanes Siruit's decision by the dispatcher may have saved hundreds of lives.
We've been preparing a return visit from Balicapapan to Callimantan, which was supposed to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities of the country are afraid that the number of victims can reach several thousand, and the agencies for reducing the risk of natural disasters claim that access to the city of Dongal, Sighi and Bhutan is limited.
Sotopa Purva Nugroho said, "Maybe the number of victims is going to increase, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig from under the clouds."
The waves, which had reached six meters, devastated Paul, where Sunday would be a mass funeral.
Vans and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Russ Kusumma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: "Every minute the car "quick" brings the body.
Pure water is not enough.
Shops are all over the place."
Hen Helfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said "CNN": "The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help those who survived, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Jock Oodda, arrived at Paul on Sunday and told the soldiers, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?," says CNN.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, she had already suffered from earthquakes in Lambok, where more than 550 people had died.
Aerial disaster in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, one man said no after the plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the voyage, which carried out an emergency landing in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were fortunately evacuated from the plane that was sinking, and now reported disappearance without the news of one passenger.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday's condition she couldn't report the location of a single passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and prosecutors to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
The local boats helped rescue the rest of the passengers and the crew after landing the plane on the water while trying to land at the island of Chuk.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday; they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain undetected.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Air Force, the plane landed in the lagoon without going to the landing area.
According to the reports of some witnesses, the plane jumped the passenger lane.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"It's very successful," said Janes.
According to him, he and the others were able to walk through the well into the water to the crash exits of the plane, which had already sunk.
He said that the barbarians were panicking and began to yell, as well as that he got a little headache.
The U.S.A. reports that seafaring seaplanes have also helped save lives by using an inflated boat to transport people to the shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to Air Safety Networks, 111 people have been killed in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea for the past 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst resumed the course of events at night when a woman was burned by a beast
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in the review of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Roulette spent several hours giving evidence as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described the jury's use of cell phone records to reinstate the 29-year-old responder Quintana Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As The Clarion Ledger reports, according to Roulette, he received information about the place from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicted his last statement.
When it was reported that his cell phone was near Chambers' phone at the time, according to his statement, he was with his friend Michael S.H.F.D. confirmed, the police were directed to send for S.F.D.
Jennifer gave the show on Saturday and confirmed that on that day he was not in the city.
When the defendant's side asked whether Tellis was telling the truth about how Sanford was in the van that night, he said that he was "false, as my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was the claim of Tellis that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Roulette, after some time after Chambers Tellis died, she had removed her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He stole her from his life," Haley said.
The side of the defense must begin the side of the conflict on Sunday.
According to the judge, it is expected that the case will be referred to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop three intends to avoid a negative view of this genre by filling his music with fixative installations.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, says that hip-hop has distanced itself from its sources: political statements and ostracative questions.
They want to return to his roots and again make the conscious hip-hop popular.
Such artists as Akala and Lowkey returned to a collection such as The Fugees and Common, the popularity in Britain.
Another black-haired?!
She from New York goes to court for a "racist" message after her release.
She from New York goes to court for a divorce after receiving a random message from her mother with a complaint that she is "one more black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, equating the call to "debate."
In 2016, Nancy Plasca-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new daughter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first working day.
"No, there's only one black man," wrote Mrs. Plaska-Faxman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
As the New York Post reported, with an understanding of the error, the Plasco-Faxman “suddenly” released Ms. Morris, arguing that the earlier girl, who was also an African American, had a bad job and that she was waiting for her Filipino instead.
Miss Morris paid the day off and sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is going to be a couple in court and wants to get a ransom in accordance with the terms that she was initially hired, even without a contract: $350 a day for six months with a lifetime.
"I want to show them what to do," she said on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied charges of racism, asserting that the release of Morris was a reasonable solution, considering that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plaska's husband.
"And would you trust your children to whom the roughness has come, even by chance?
Your niece?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The plane parallels the call to "removal" and reports that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"And will you persecute a man in such a situation?
It's pretty hard," said an investment-banking specialist.
Although the judiciary is still continuing, the public opinion quickly condemned a couple in social networks, subjecting them to strict criticism of their behavior and logic.
Publishers on Hold have feared that readers will not oppose the bears that speak in a new sheet
Bonda Karen Yangkel's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's so interesting to read it, already knowing about the great success of Padgton."
She said that her father, who was working on a BBC operator before he tried to write a book for children about a small ring bear, was optimistic despite his failure to accept his work and added that the 60-year-old edition of the book was "golden-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father quietly prided himself on his final success, saying of whom she described as "very important member of our family."
"He was quite a quiet man, and not quite an exaggerator," she said.
"But since Podgington was so real to him, it was almost fatherly honor for the child which had been demanded: you will be proud of them, though it is indeed not your duty.
I think he's been looking at the success of Padgton exactly in such a key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave up the right thing to the King himself."
My daughter died, and I had to talk to her on the phone
After her daughter was laid, she was delivered to Nica Louis Pastera 2 Hospital, where the doctors had longed for her life.
"There was a regular phone call to tell me that everything was really bad that she couldn't stand," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then I called over to tell her that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to ask her out.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors, who had given to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the end.
I just had to sit there knowing that everything was open there.
I could neither groan nor cry nor cry, for there were families and people around me.
I had to stay."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who had survived the loss of her daughter, sat on a plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know what she had to go through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head and bowed my face all the time with tears.
It's hard to explain, but it's just in the field that I got a feeling of compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women who are sad report cards to prevent killing on a bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have committed suicide do all they can to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphres report cards on hot words and phone numbers that people can get help at the Wells Bridge.
Mr. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18 years of age, he ended his life with suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel like I feel myself," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Sydney, said that her son was a talented boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room."
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body dead.
Mrs. Davis says, "I am constantly worried that this may have unpleasant consequences."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so that people knew that there are people in the world who you can talk to even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Harris, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday he was very depressed: when the children opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
She said his death had been a great trauma to them, but it had to be with this life: 'In the family there was a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Future Brett Cavano is uncertain because the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought we could have what he wanted -- limited in time and scope of research -- we could get a bit of unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was "stirring up" because of what actually happened in the trial.
Why don't Mr. Cavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their dissatisfaction is sometimes explained.
Intermediate elections in five weeks, 6 November -- if Republicans are expected to suffer at once, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the highest court for their candidates.
George Bush called the senator to salute Mr. Cavano's support, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as a personal secretary to Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There's going to be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Until it became clear whether Mr. Cavano would receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Penso to resolve the issue of equality of vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives has decreased in Kim's direction
The number of refugees from North Korea to South went down since Kim Chen came to power seven years ago, a South Korean officer said.
Back Bo Sun, bringing data from the Ministry of South Korea's merger, said that last year there were 1127 refugees, and in 2011 2706.
Mr. Park said that the main reasons are reinforced cross-checks between North Korea and China and the higher costs that smugglers have set up to reform.
Phen'an didn't comment on it at all.
Most of the refugees from the north with what they get citizens of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean residents illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, with the longest border in North Korea. It's easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very hard to keep.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often reports them.
The relationship between the North and the South -- which is technically still in war -- has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyana for the words that were about denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Yin in June in Singapore when they agreed in general terms to work fully out the Korean peninsula's nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Yan Ho accused the American sanctions in the absence of progress since that time.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no certainty in our national security, and under such conditions we are not going to disarm the first," said Mr. Rhy in a speech at the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy called Brett Cavano an "Isterical," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court
A minority leader in Nancy Pelozy's Chamber of Representatives called a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano an "esteric" and said that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelezy said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the idea that if it were for a woman to behave like this, she would be called an "historic,"' said Pelozy about his reaction to the Cavano speech before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
They've been emotionally charged with sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory talk, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and could not talk when his family and the older classes were discussing.
He also strongly accused the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against his "gratish and organised murder" by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelozy said that he thought that the Cavan's speech showed that he couldn't work in the Supreme Court, because he clearly showed that he had a case against the Democrats.
"I think he has discredited himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pellets stopped when she was asked if she would try the influence of the Cavan when he was selected and when the Democrats got most in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say so--if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he should not only work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
At this point, Cavano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Pelozy added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavano against the law on available medicine or in the Row case against Wade, because Kavano was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing of confirmation on Cavano's estate, he did not answer the questions, whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, obsessive people to work in court and to expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'" said Pelosi.
And a woman must bear it.
It's a justified guilty speech, months and years of anger just melts, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We're crying when we get angry," 45 years ago, Miss Stein told me.
"I don't think it's so rare."
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who worked with the director, and who said that when she was angry, she was crying, but she was working on a behavior technique, and when she was angry and started crying, she said to the conversation: "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept talking.
I think it was great."
The tears are allowed in part to come out of the grief, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of the first job I once cried out of unforgivable anger, and then I was caught by an elderly woman, a restrained chief, who always frightened me a little, and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you in tears," she said.
"They do not know that you are angry.
They think you'll be sad and happy to give you."
Patrio Schroeder, then a member of the Congolese Democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt fell into a marriage betrayal on a train called Monkey Business and left the presidential race, Mrs. Schroder's very angry wife thought she could participate in the presidential company herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out solution," she laughed and said to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I was quite unnecessary to them.
Someone called this "Belgian and Seven Dwarves."
Since the company had been running for quite a long time, she had no resources, so she said she wouldn't take part in the elections if she didn't take $2 million.
It was a sinister situation.
It turns out that some of her followers who sacrificed $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"They think I'm going to waste?" she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election of the company, she was so deeply touched by the emotions -- thanks to the people who supported her -- the anger of the system that made it so much more difficult to get money and targeted at voters, not candidates, and the anger of sexism -- that she took breath.
'You might think I have a nervous breakdown,' recalled Mrs. Schrader in her reaction to the press.
"It was possible to think that my corporate sponsor was the producer of Kleinex paper.
I used to think they'd write on my super-missile rock?

Why a trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first loopholes of trade war between China and the United States were deaf, and since war was far from over, in the longer prospect of misunderstandings between countries might be for the benefit of Beijing, the experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning early this year, taxing China's main export companies, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week when new tariffs charged goods to the total of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of the goods that occur in the United States of China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way by raising recent fees from five to ten percent on American companies at $60 billion.
China's allies in the United States are symmetrical, and the second in terms of the economy is hardly going to lead.
To make Washington withdraw, we need to deepen our demand, but the public tendency towards the United States is practically unacceptable to China's China's leader.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the US war can sustain China in a far-reaching way by reducing the interdependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a quick political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than the observers thought before," said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia, at the research-analytical centre of new American security.
Grey "ready" to return refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready to return refugees and calls for help in getting a country destroyed by a war that took more than seven years.
Referring to the General Assembly, AAN, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulam said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and means of life.
AAN believes more than 5.5 million orphans left the country at the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more who live in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mulam claimed that the Syrian regime would gladly help to rebuild the devastated land.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept help in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebels.
Europe has won the Cup of Ryder in Paris

The American star Phil Michelson, who fought most of all at the tournament, pushed his ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16th hole, joining this match by Francesco Mullers.
Italian golfer Malinari was a great player in all the rounds, making one of the four players who went through this field with the number 5-0-0 from the beginning of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Schpsch was beat up by 5 and 4 players with the lowest rankings in the European team, Thornbird Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's most successful player in the world, lost 2 and 1 Ien Poulter from England, who probably played in his last cube of Ryder.
The veteran of the eight cubes of Ryder Spanish Serchia Garcia has become a player who has won more than all the tournaments with a career of 25.5 points.
'Of course I don't cry, but today I can't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get the cube back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad that I could help,' said excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the essay to his countryman John Ram, who had won the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods on Sunday in the lone match 2+1.
"I'm very proud of what I won at Tiger Woods, the man who's been waiting for his childhood career," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record number 13-21-3 in Ryder's cube.
The amazing statistics of one of the largest players of all time who won 14 main titles and left only Jack Niklaus behind.
The U.S. team fought with it except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tney Finn, who played a high-class golf tournament.
American Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game to protect his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're battlers.
This morning we showed Europe what we could do.
We've won.
Take off your hats to the honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cube Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat before them.
We've been overplayed."
