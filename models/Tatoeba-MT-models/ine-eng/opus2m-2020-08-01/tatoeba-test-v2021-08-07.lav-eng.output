When an English speaker notices that the stranger he speaks to, without understanding something he said, he repeats exactly the same, but more than that, as this person would be a Kurd. At no time does he realize that his choice of his name might be difficult, or that his statement could be easily understood by a stranger, and that he could say it more simply with other words. As a result, a person not only does not still understand what he is saying, but also becomes concerned about being considered a Kurd.
