According to the Tatoeby guidelines, it is recommended that members only add or translate sentences in their native language from a language they understand in their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to make texts in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sing strangely. Please translate the phrase only if you know with certainty what it means.
