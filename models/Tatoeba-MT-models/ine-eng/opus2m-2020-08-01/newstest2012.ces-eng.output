Parliament has not supported a new release of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today has refused to cancel the proposal within the framework of a new criminal law paragraph, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Julia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment that would pave the way for the release of the prisoner expremire was rejected by the Members at second reading of the proposal to mitigate the penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October to conclude a allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the convicted person shall be brought in December.
Tymoshenko marks the political verdict of the regime, the suspicion of the Court of Justice has also led to proceedings in the West.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the expert was convicted, supported the vote of 147 Members.
It took 226 votes to approve.
Libya’s Victory
The story of Libya's liberation, or Libya's rebellion, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after war.
There's still to define the winner.
As I used to be in the country, in the election of the Islamic winners, it's about whether it's moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary right of Sharia and we already have a certain idea about him.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the hand is torn by theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, the possible wastes of faith wait for repair and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a company consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
Only our way of life is not the only one, nor is it objectively the best, and probably would not suit the Libyans just mentioned for change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors received thanks from unbelieving dogs.
It's only apologizing that from their point of view, he didn't drive any general of America, but Allah, whose size was celebrated in every given effort.
So when they're looking for winners in Libya, the west doesn't belong to them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the political union as a dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not engage in military occupations.
That's why locals have a problem with "crusting".
But will they have no oil company for Libyan gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the inexhaustible protection of human rights.
So if that doesn't stop us from telling you about the Sharia law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have reached the investor search
The statistical crime went through Europe on Tuesday.
Individual States published HDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has been stagnantly stagnant, Germany and France are growing.
It's a long-term market, but today it's a record market.
Investors are no longer only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
HDP Germany grew by expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries at the same time adjusted data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (a growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%) and France indicated a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the quarter of the year, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the ČSU, confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance.
The results are worse than analytical estimates.
The most important events are:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year, but stagnantly.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year, according to preliminary and seasonally overestimated data.
The eurozone economy and the European Union grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 per cent annually.
The result on her 10-year-old debt is 28.45%.
The results of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Problems also start to feel Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium etc.
The results of Czech 10 years of debt remain below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
Germany has voted that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrates the 200 million process
The football performance was the hardest task of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and beautiful Bran Peter Jiráčka won 1:0.
Czech football and with a great deal of luck in the second half of the year has sparked a luxury jump from home vendetta and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz was following the process match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech representation also thanks to the domestic doom in marriage, the great Czech and Historic Jiráčov won in Montenegro a happy 1:0 and celebrates the process of the European Championship.
The blacksmiths were pressured to the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech population.
The match breakers became Damjanovich and Vučinić, who burned two great odds.
Even thanks to the excellent Czech representation of Peter Czech, neither will the next year miss the European championship, and the reward of some 200 million crowns is added to the foreign football money.
He's been playing a lot of combat football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were hard to get into the combination and played mostly around half a line.
The pressure of domestic footballers didn't come in the first half, because the Czech defences had just turned them away.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their gesture of support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students prayed before the facility and then died in the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students at the Iranian Isfahan University created a living shield on Tuesday around Isfahan's nuclear technology center, where uranium is processed.
They make it clear that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran has, according to all, not stopped its efforts on nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facility is being discussed in Israel.
On the afternoon before entering the Isphahan nuclear facility, the students prayed and then provoked the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear programme as much as possible, the Israeli press, apart from the Isfahan Centre, would also aim at the facility in which uranium is enriched.
Obese child dish: not eating and dinner parties
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with an excessive weight of 9 per cent of schoolchildren and obese children being 5 per cent.
The obese children, however, mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, as the current survey showed.
Once again it shows how important it is for the healthy human development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns in which it is surrounded.
For example, at the tables in obese children, there are more than half of them than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried vegetables had no chance of having more than 19 per cent of the obese by dinner before research related to the lighting action called Obesity.
In the fat families too, sports is not the custom, but most families of today’s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of the children responded that their parents would find time for active activity at least once a week.
Research among 900 children
The study was carried out at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from elementary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second anniversary of the Ouzita action, not an accident that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
However, proper feeding and sufficient movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of the respondents said, for example, that it was five times a day in breakfast-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet, which is one of the basic requirements of proper nutrition," one of the results of the study.
No breakfast and evening of the ceremony
Experts point out that for healthy development there are also relevant details, including regular family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of the families of schoolchildren eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone has a meal.
And the worst part was finding out that in ten households there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for the right daily meal.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, more and more people consume unhealthy foods.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 per cent).
Although he regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children in question, the result was less than half - 15 percent for their parents.
Set up your menu.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up of the options offered by their own eater according to their own taste and opinion.
"The care preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 have from a healthy diet far away from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of soft, massive and sweet food.
"The alarm is in particular a large form of sweet lemonades," the final report states.
To lunch as the main food, the pasta won close over the poultry.
However, the children did not want to have any candy at all, and the shape of fish and yesterday's vegetables is also low.
A Cause for Health
At the same time, the study showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In the monitoring group of participants in the survey who completed the questionnaire after the end of the worldly lecture Obesity is not an accident, there was in a number of cases a significant preference shift towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project are indicated.
For example, it was among sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Also, children are more often caught in the poultry and fish questionnaire as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and rabbits.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard professionals
In the opening article on how to teach stylists, I was so excited that it was a lot in the beginning hours.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
The lectures of three professionals from the field, the clothing of problematic characters and the seminar on how it goes.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "inflated."
This time, Director Allenka and I discussed (there is not one boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly balanced character.
And most of them are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's a boy's character again with no right curves and someone's overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually change the broad shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got as much tips as for women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, bigger breasts and sides and tight belts, the character to highlight nicely and at the same time not to dress too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the belt and the sides is such that the skirts or the pants are not really sitting, then it will pay to have at least one such piece of peace.
You certainly won't regret it, because the perfectly falling clothes are for free.
In your dress at peace you will feel much better than in the one that keeps moving, including, staying in the passport and so on.
A boy’s character can again be allowed to wear clothing with shave, application, spread or pickup.
Such information and types of characters are, of course, a lot, so I'm glad that I've spent the whole week setting up all the information in my head.
And I'm also afraid that, given the task at home, it's up to it.
Each of the coursers received an associated celebrity, which is intended to invent two outfits: day and night.
We need to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the given personality and type of character.
I'm gonna "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my mind, it is certainly better for me personally than for Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently taken a hundred kilos (please, in the cover) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet and print and then process graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and the relationship to graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product page in magazines (on specific tasks, such as trends in cables, cables, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's till Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture with information about the types of characters has just caught up with three guests from the area.
Stylist Honza Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a silky stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
The variability is key in this case.
So you should wear such a trinkets (or if you want to initially trinchcoat) classic across jeans and shirts like a coat, but you can also wear it on a naked body, wrap around the boat and paint it like a dress.
Or it's enough to cover your sleeves or wrists, and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
So I finally understand why we're messing with all the lessons we can combine with, what, why, even though we can see something else in fashion magazines.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know again that the stylist must have prepared a lot more outfits than they are to be photographed.
So in the fashion story that's going to have ten pages (so ten outfits), I have to be ready to "stabilize" at least fifteen.
And also that on the dress photo it looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckda completely different from actually.
So we have to count on it when making the outfit.
That the image and style make lukewarm up to half the success, confirmed us Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, who's not exactly a wonderful singer, but the image and marketing of her made the world an old man.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of the services of stylists is still colder.
Even the well-known faces of her lukewarm are considered unnecessary (but I just know something, what I look like is secondary).
And if someone from us is going to create styling, then we're going to have to count with the fact that he's probably imposing on us a completely different (less) size than he really does.
Then there's nothing left but Google and find out if the butterfly didn't write that the celebrity in question was toasted/sweet and so on.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario put it in our hearts that the stylists are not going to be fashion oriented and able to wear outfits.
In his work he communicates primarily with the people he's wearing, and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To estimate people, not to look at themselves, to follow your opinion.
"If you're ordered by some manager to order her a dresser and fill her with good pieces, then you can't throw her out the whole box and say, "Oh, my God, that's scary."
"Find at least a few things you commend and recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "platform" or the bag on the spot.
It's the one you turn around the belt and you have all the necessary properties.
In addition to clear things such as nails, hair-fighting or closing pins, there are also silicone thread (with it the stylist helps with the photos of products such as cables or hats), special clips that we put on behind clothes, if larger (spins or other pins are not permissible, would destroy clothing) or shirts.
To help us not only listen but also try something practical, we learned how to stick our shoes properly.
Even when you take a photo at a workshop where there's a flat surface, you could damage your ankle, then out.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch our boots with our knives so they don't hurt us by accident.
So there's a real need for delivery.
Mario was pleased when my creation without exception commended me.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
I'm starting to get as clear as possible that getting used to styling at the professional level really isn't a walk to the pink garden, whoever wants to say what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Reviews
Originally carefree rides with a series of completely overcrowded mistakes turn into a routine morning trip to the sleigh.
Ambition has failed to a significant extent, but it is not valid when no one obviously wanted to do anything else.
A new section entitled The Run woke up before the issue of high expectations.
He promised that the flight series Need for Speed would again move the pieces in a new direction and from the playable samples appeared as a game that in the genre of the action race should not only be counted.
We were also curious about the impact of the inserted passports, in which the main hero comes out of the car and runs after his own.
As with the NFS series, many are somewhat different as a result than we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but they've been pulling down a few remaining mistakes that have appeared in the series for more than a few years.
So it's not really a mistake, but it's more of a demonstration of some incomprehensible lens of the developers.
Adventure's starting very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You'll be sitting on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to get to New York first.
The idea is that there are several interesting elements.
The track is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
As a result, each race goes on a different course and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
A man doesn't even have a moment to feel like he'd always offer the same game.
In addition, some of the environment is very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing worldly.
But the ride across the desert, the autumn landscape, or high in snowy mountains seems very pleasant.
In addition, the competitions have been seasoned with some unusual element from time to time.
For example, in the desert you see a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to get caught up in the vineyard.
Besides, they're pretty good at each other's race.
There are only a few of them, but that's enough.
Now you're trying to figure out the required number of competitors (mostly the classic race), then you're running out of time (classic battle with the tracks) and then you need a duel with the only opponent.
The police will be involved from time to time, which continues to displease your efforts.
The news is passports outside the car.
It's more about such interactive animation when Jack usually pushes someone in front of him, and you have to help him in that way by pressing the right button at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that these passports are much less in play than you would expect (in particular, maybe only three).
As a result, however, this is for the benefit of things, because this element is not likely to become annoying and in the context of the above-mentioned words, it ranks among the elements of the game.
The driving model goes in the tracks of previous works.
That means it's definitely no longer anybody today, but it can't be said that it would be an objection.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But more specifically, the driving model here is still quite good, although we could find better in competition.
Until then, everything's fine.
But problems are beginning to emerge after some time.
Unlike the driver's model, because there's no way there's a collision model.
We don't expect this type of game to include complex deformations and collisions, but if you don't have the slightest idea of how your car behaves, then probably not everything is fine.
Typically, when driving or changing cars in normal operation, you will sometimes only easily lick each other, but on the other hand in almost identical situations your car will end in wild pirates.
Or even a straight shot.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't really matter, but it'll make you feel better.
The restarts are solved in such a way that if you break or drive away from the track, it will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
But the restarts are only five in each race.
Once you're exhausted, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help if you don't say anything than you can trust them explicitly.
But sometimes the restarts won't help, they'll solve it until you learn to remember a certain piece of race.
The great insomnia of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns like this are needed in a specific way, otherwise you will not be able to see them in a short time.
Otherwise you'll meet the "civil" cars again in the same configuration either first, fifth, five seconds before or a minute later.
It’s particularly annoying when you see a rival between the two anti-driving cars running easily before you, while when you get there, cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them or speed them up.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "counted" so that the situation is always right in front of your nose.
The rivals have another advantage.
During the game you will strike several places where you will again, regardless of the time, always pass the same opponent in the same place.
Mostly it hits the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get in front of you, obviously, at any price.
If he's going before you, he's going to make your view of the anti-driving cars worse, so you're probably getting a lot of fun at first.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more tense and adrenaline more, but the realization is so obvious that it will certainly quickly disappoint you.
And it's a pity, because even through a simple driving model is playing fun and places so much action that sometimes you don't literally tend to watch where it's flying.
And basically it doesn't matter whether he deserves a concept with fifty unique tracks, a series of races so that the nude doesn't have a chance, or anything else.
A non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the road, because you can change the car right there, although in most cases you will have enough of what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sporters are suitable for urban areas, strong American boars on equal roads and exotic supersports on technical driving, for example on clickable mountain roads.
With the main history mode goes hand in hand and mode of challenge, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also points of experience in your profile, which is common to challenges and stories.
To obtain a higher level of drivers different objects are withdrawn: start cars and end with backgrounds for profile.
At the same time, it is again connected with the on-line Autolog function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understanding miners is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the metro tunnel (whisper) where you will marry in the dark after your wheels (whisper).
On the tachometer you see numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (whispering) and in the background you will get a set of meters and will uncompromisingly crush you.
In the editorial, it's probably going to take us a few more days to discuss whether no one really thought about the game, or whether our authors are such a big fool.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in several cases even great.
It's freezing so that in some more drunken moments, it's slowing down, and in some cases it's pretty tragic.
However, this is especially true of a large number of participants, if you have no gas footage.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to enjoy the widest scale of the younger audience, a soundtrack from the category "every dog other grass" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music the game is probably not just someone to buy.
The overall impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so desperate.
If the game were to get rid of all unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
That's how the game works.
The fun's definitely cool, but prepare to make sure you're going to miss the force of the airport reflectors.
The UK Singing Councils will sing at the student concert of the summit
The association of the International Study Day and the anniversary of the Samet Revolution with the music experience already offers the third festival of Festa Academy.
During it is presented at twenty high school and high school singing congregations.

The Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly disrupted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little stable, calm and all players will get used to their new roles," began their lecture at the Faculty of Law at the Czech Embassy of the European Union Milena Vicenová.
As she took her motto "Early and openly about Europe" seriously, she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she was able to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that a series of lecturers from the UK Faculty of Law could envy her.
The Vice-President also welcomed the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuye:
"In the first place, criticism has emerged that it is insignificant that it is a gray officer that cannot play any role, and I must say that everyone has expressed their breath that he has done well."
"It is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them in an excellent way and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new High Representative's post for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained in answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, a significant step towards the unification and greater readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to stop us from getting any oxygen.
The Vice-President also devoted himself to the agenda that the European Council lived, lived and will live at the earliest possible time.
The Czech Pre-trial Presidency has been a success.
The Czechs solved the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis, or organised the Eastern Partnership Summits.
The fall of the government at that time marked a major negative that had seriously damaged the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
The word "fremole fact" was said not only by the Presidency, but also by the subsequent financial crisis that has been resolved so far.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has to be approved, which is a major complicatement due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be modest and cost-effective, which sectors will receive more and less support from the countries, is all in the order of future negotiations.
She also reminded the Ambassador of her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe intelligible".
"I really don't like bad shorts, foreign words, handcuffs that no one understands.
How does the citizen understand that there are really no curved or bulletproof cookies in Brussels, bananas that are very large, or that someone really has to ban the cheeses?"
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe is waiting for us.
According to the embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who are more aware of those negative than positive sides of the thing.
In addition, she is sorry for the low Czech representation in European institutions.
It considers that there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, the Visegrad Four have increased its strength and cooperation.
"Believe me that when Poland and Hungary come to me and the Slovak is approaching, then the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what's your Visegrad Four?' and it doesn't matter.
In the future of the Union, according to the Vice-Presidents, new sound rules for budgetary policies of the Member States are expected.
As a very real one, the concept of dual speed, unless Europe is multi-speed, is more than a new "European Federation".
"We have countries outside the euro area and countries outside the euro area."
"We've got Schengen space, we've already got a strong cooperation institution."
"For the first time it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those who did not want to stand down."
"These institutions will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in applying the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be discussed between all Member States, not just between the euro area countries.
Fire history:
Innovator IBM begins its existence in the second century
If someone were to look for a word that most accurately expresses the IBM strategy, it would probably be "longevity".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of a technological revolution, it is a company that is very modern, and yet it has been 100 years since its establishment.
The foundation of this long term was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already broken the password that a number of world problems can easily be solved if people are willing to think.
His password "think!" became a printing press around which the life of the future giant will take place (and also the name of the internal magazine that began to come out in IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis for Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her basic values and yet was not afraid to change everything around her.
That allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve even more," said current director of Samuel J. Palmisano for the year.
Processed system
Watson, in his thirties, had access to care for his employees, as well as the company Bâta in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a designed system to reward the best inventors and traders.
It also has a long IBM relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, society has been brilliant in demanding talents - as one of the first world companies has abolished any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will set up a woman - Virginia Rometti in front of IBM next year.
It has been in IBM for 30 years, so far stands the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years IBM has made so-called caves, online brainstormings, many of which are emerging future strategies and innovations.
It's no wonder that ideas are enough - almost half a million people work in the company.
Good name institutions
A certain position in the business ensures companies its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technological firm," said Professor Harvard Business School Economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology firm, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," George Colony of the Forrester Research consulting firm added.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market evenly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is known because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in hundreds of years.
It's probably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in the product range from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds most of the patents from all American technology companies and her five employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATMs, payment cards, financial swaps, linecodes or diskettes.
IBM has now become the second largest technology firm in market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when Microsoft came first in 1996.
Front view
Not all products and innovations have come to the taste of customers and time - IBM for example failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, on-line Prodigy service or computer IBM PCjr.
"If your business is built on the move ahead, you cannot emotionally cling to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike the competitive Microsoft that basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM markets, the largest share of services is, after about five is made up of software and hardware.
However, in 1990 he was with more than half the most powerful representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
The investment continues since 2008 when the first world overruns the recent financial crisis.
IBM is one of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the great economic crisis.
So far IBM seems to be undergoing the current crisis unaffected.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's share price has risen by 120 per cent, the company's net profit is constantly increasing.
IBM's firm password is to change everything, just not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will handle it.
History of IBM: From cheese crusher to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally called Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over until 1924 - originally a brand used for the company’s branches in Canada and South America.
Based on the subsequent IBM, the merger was given to four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They own technology like the famous "pigs", which means the hours that record employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company’s supervisory board by 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then defended the founders of IBM - on Watson's thoughts is still built an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business - from legumes of meat and cheese to treasure.
During the first four years that Watson managed, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and began to expand the company to all the world headquarters.
Watson was so invincible to the company that after almost forty years in the chief chair, he had his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to fly to space - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous year of man on the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "buffet," which became the computer standard of the time, with the name IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold the Chinese computer production of Lenovo, instead bought a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and started to fully devote advice and services with a high value added.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years of IBM is the concept of Smarter Planet.
Its aim is to make wise use of technology in areas not yet planned and to improve the situation, for example in transport or city management.
For the area of trade, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps traders run the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country as well.
She founded her side in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Centres for Central and Eastern Europe are located in Prague and there is also a research team at world level dealing with voice recognition.
A husband of an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, let him go, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Richtara (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartoša (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she is not willing to wait, and she has set clear rules for the next life.
"Peppa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explains Richtář.
When Darina Richtářová provided asylum to Bartoš in her home in summer, she probably did not even know how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved out of the river after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina gave up her relationship with her husband and now she even gave him good - bye.
Hurryers don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
If the Richter and Bartosch broke up just once, his wife's hand open will not be waiting.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him away."
"But not as my beloved, misguided old ass, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Richtář said, saying that she has already left her husband and only lasts for each other's obedience.
Joseph's being locked by Darina's back door doesn't matter yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I don't want to change it."
"Marriage set up a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, property, buying."
"Darino and I are having a perfectly normal time, just because we don't share beds together," the Bright Knight said.
If Richter also finds a new love, he won't defend her.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph closed.
The worst women's habits: Do they concern you too?
When you ask men if they could name some typical female vices, they usually all in one are very ready to get out of the glove.
Dear women, do you know in the following lines where there are a number of women's habits that can perfectly pump blood into the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half count that you're dependent on buying?
Do you have to buy at least one hat a week?
Are you buying love and a lot in discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about buying as a habit.
Some women realize that they should have at least a little bit of love for their buyer.
But tell me, who would resist this just to walk through the clothes store, look for the good falling ends and then try them all (ideally in different colorings) in the cabin?
Although for most women buying a horse, for men it can literally become a hell of a lot.
Just remember how many times you told your friend that he'd rather wait for you before the entrance...
Unsatisfying
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five kilos - should I start practicing?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't these words remind you of anything?
Isn't that right?
Then you belong to women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an endless cycle.
Washes windows, drying, brushing the skin, cleaning the dust, shaking the baths - at least twice a week.
You're counting on your partner to slip a dirty foot on a clean plate, to the kids to get the dirty laundry cleaned up, and to get a smooth living wall that you've been doing so much work with?
In case you suffer from this "feel", try to realize that nothing is to be exaggerated and order and purity should certainly not be within the family first.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships and your family atmosphere.
Dizziness
"You used coaches, put them in the trash."
"Are you gonna wear those old legs tomorrow?"
"The wet strike on the ground doesn't belong."
If that's how you mess with your partner a few times a day, you know you'll be able to tie him up safely.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, but you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women wouldn't be able to rip so much again...
Dyspnoea, pruritus
For some women, they also have their own stories, jokes, but also insulting and collaborating against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, and why.
I hope every one of us gets a little harmless fight or a curse out there.
Hand on the heart, it's my own for all women.
On the other hand, they are the blush of the worst grain, which they like and often tremble, perhaps they are all over everyone, and they are especially dangerous to their environments - especially within the framework of the women's working group.
Jagr and Voráček helped with Philly's victory aid
Hockey attacker Jaromír Jagr participated in a Monday NHL match with two assistants in the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina ice and is again in the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added another recording and was declared the best player in the game, was the star star.
Two assistants in the match also recorded Jágr's partner Jakub Voráček.
The game after the battle with foreign journalists claimed that Giroux had foretold a great night.
"Before the game, I told him he'd have a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you will feel that way," explained Jágr, after which Giroux gave the goal of the first Flyers shot.
Some time later, he had a second strike with the Czech team.
The vortex beat behind the Hurricanes wheel and presented it between the circles of Max Talbot.
The second before the first stop was reduced in the weakening of the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially to Giroux.
After working with Jagrem, he shot the third target, then shot his arrow through the current in the fourth branch of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jagr evaluated his center.
"I would never think that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
"I'm glad."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL my partners tried to play me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Carolina from the match still made the drama, the gull of Tuoma Routu and again Dwyer, who suffered from a criminal shooting, got away with one branch.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who arranged for the number two to one.
"He's a great hit in our Pronger belt."
"He blew the wheel, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to the distance."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked," he described the last line of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špatek did not win the fight against Buffal, in the second third he resigned due to injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens, along with the experienced back, also lost double-blind leadership and lost after the penalty range 2:3.
One of their rides hasn't changed Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach was more than the lost points hated by the vast marauder rear row, with only five defenders playing the match.
"It's bad."
"We only played the game with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do with it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Accommodating has come upon us, and we have not been able to resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, removed the crack from our belt."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defenders of P.K. Subban.
Czech marketer Ondrij Paulec contributed thirty attacks by Winnipeg to the 5:2 victory over Tampou Bay.
About the Jets goose, which interrupted the five-pass series of breakthroughs, five different shooters were divided.
How train prices have developed since 1989
By 1989, only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
At that time, travel agencies sold in the dry majority only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, since travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus traveled on vacation to the sea to NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soci na Krim at the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslav regime acceded to the West and the Czech tourist journeys to Yugoslavia were consequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that it was not possible for the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel freely on an individual basis even within the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation from that country, otherwise it was not an individual journey.
Traveling offices at that time also offered trips to the West, but there was a need to stand up over the night with a package or to have a "well-known" travel office.
It wasn't even won.
The so-called foreign currency vow, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czech Republic's currency was not a freely convertible currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on the Western route.
However, far more often the Czechs spent their vacation abroad, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalapses that Czechs have made, and this habit still survives.
The Czech travels have experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While by 1989 she was allowed our maximum in the NDR or Bulgaria, the waves spent Czechs abroad 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are not aware of today is that it was not possible to travel freely until 1989 for us at the time of the most popular Croatia, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the end of the 1990s, visa obligations in the neighbouring Western European countries were abolished, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits to Austria or Germany.
The Czechs couldn't travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czechs took turns in the parks in the states, as our then revenues did not allow us to pay for the hotel or guesthouse.
The typical picture of Czech travel was the driving of its own food, cans, salads, etc. at this time to save it.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely interchangeable Czech crowns, which our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and the average wages with it have fallen, which has stopped around 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of the increased demand for travel, the travel offices have been regularly preparing flights with charter airlines since 1997, which has resulted in an incredibly low number of airline flights with the possibility of bringing down quantitative reductions compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had had virtually no contact with all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of evolutionary travel arose in 2000 immediately, when thanks to a significant request from the Czech Republic, the first direct charter flight to exoticity was made to Thailand.
Since this year, Czech tourists have flown direct charters to warm distant countries, this year's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting about 100 thousand Czechs annually!
Another interesting moment in this period, symbolizing our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished a visa for Czech tourists and thus definitely made our country one of the most successful countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs also spent more than half their foreign leave (50.3%) for the first time in history, and for the first time in history they lost one foreign leave, including the cost of living more than 15,000.
The Valna is supposed to find the president, but again he's threatening the Pat.
For almost five months the Czech football without a president threatens that the successor Ivan Haška in front of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after another extraordinary event that will take place in Nymburce on Thursday.
There is still no agreement on which electoral order will be taken.
Without her, she won't even vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interests of leading Czech football include Jindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelt and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned in June and at his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Haskov, football was turned back into riots between the two joint chambers, which could not be agreed on by the joint candidate.
It was fully shown on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the Vale Assembly went to the National House in Prague on Smych in vain, because the meeting was blocked and not just the way of the election.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote on the assembly itself - whether only the statutory representatives or the officials of the trust are in full power.
In this only point since then, a partial agreement has been established which has also helped to recommend the Constitution for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The spores, however, still dominate the electoral order.
He did not make it quite clear that even an executive committee, which, in its discussions, is already doing nothing else, whether it is right or wrong, would not do anything else.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neurological point is still the same.
The question is: How to proceed in circle 3 to rule out the possibility of paternity?
"The dispute is whether to act in accordance with the terms or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of FACHR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the terms of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate will win a higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he is nominated.
The morale is supposed to be willing to go to the retreat to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the weight in this percentage calculation.
"If it then left the meaning of the two previous cycles, it would completely contradict the two-room concept," understands the objections of the Moravian Party of Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to avoid and choose according to the current states.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this in a surprising way, although it is estimated that the electoral order of the states meets with all the candidates most of Pelt.
"I wish it would be chosen by state as a maximum."
"To avoid any reprehensible nonsense as on the previous wave assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements he was particularly opposed to Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburce, according to him, the new president will know and believe that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All are passionately calming down today's national team's approach to Europe's championship."
"Football will be happy again, will be more willing to cooperate," says the Jablonic factor, who has the three most experienced football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more resistant.
"I hope in the agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very disillusioned."
"It's not between people from Czech and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the rules."
"That may cause the blockage of the Vale Assembly to come again."
"But I hope she wins a healthy sense," said Rachel.
There's not much time left on the agreement of all parties.
Some of the events were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality in the match would be complete at all.
The airline special, in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things, the Vice-Chairman Dalibor Kučera and Reichl, because of the technical failure of Prague, did not fly in the morning and sought a replacement option to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barage charge.
Finally, there may be a decision-making meeting at ministerial level, which could possibly be in the middle.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to bring the most powerful sports association within the country into agreement.
There is a lot of this in the game: state grants, the credibility of football, and also the forthcoming CSTV wave, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
The fight is about the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the Chief of Footballers Plzno Tomáš Paclík saw a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary wave assembly who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not even join in the fight for the ultimate function.
"If there was a quality adept, I'd fight for him and I won't go to the election."
"But in the current situation no one has managed to find such a thing," said ČTK Paclík.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jindrich Reichl's wife Paklík motivates him to try to prevent Pelt, an alleged favourite choice, in the way to the front of FAČR.
Paklik also stresses that in the event of his victory, he would only hold the presidency until 2013, when there is a proper wave of events on the programme.
In a function he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too involved with the football event.
"I spoke to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"That's what I'd like to change," he said.
The Pacíkov is now the most difficult thing to do with Pelt's connection to the president of the Plzeńsk Regional Football Union Roman Berbre, a man with controversial reputation, who is known as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates on the volleyball.
It's so hard for Paklika to get Pelta to be in the president's position.
"If he won, then the current state is preserved and nothing in the football will move forward."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a capable merchant, it would not succeed more football," Paclík said.
It also argues that Pelt's name was announced years ago by the envoys during the investigation of the corruption affair, from which Pelta was released without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking over his earlier sentence that he would "sold the Plenary Club if Pelta became president".
If Paclík were to triumph in the Thursday election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Reichl, who was supported by Paclik in front of the shadow wave crowd that ended with a fiasco, is also considering.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of representation."
"But management wouldn't have managed to run an association."
"I also will not knock my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who, in September, raised a great deal of attention by standing in front of the decision-makers' committee, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
The stick claims he'd be in charge of the association.
He is referring to his ability to run private companies, and from last year he has also led Plzi, who, with his support in May, celebrated the Premier League's triumph.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and recalling commission, which goes to unpleasant situations," said Paclík, who does not conceal his antipathy, for example, to the Spanish chief Daniel Cretan.
One of the priorities would also be to see FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee as a priority, with which he would lobby for more money from the lottery tax at the political peaks.
"It's one of the key things the new president should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties say, I understand their argument, but at the level they have to say where the money goes," he said.
As a competition now Paclík does not even accept his connection to the Plenary Club, although he himself claims that the President of FAČR should be "foreign".
Pelta's connected to Jablonc again, Rachel to the Prague Dock.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't even see the point of transferring my shares to someone in the Plenary Club and coming back in a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new FAČR positions that would exclude the electoral path
Two days ago, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that, in the event of an election, the principle of having a new position for FACHR would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonsk official is optimistic before the Thursday event in Nymbource and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly determine the possible success of today's football performance.
Pelta has already promised, prior to the election of January, that it is precisely in the case of the elections that he intends to concentrate on representing and obtaining finance.
In the election before the last Vale Assembly, he decided to go for the last minute, and then a two-month delay could be made to defend and present his ideas on football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to know."
"It feels that it is the best time for the association to lead," says a man who is mostly associated with the Jablone club, but who has been working in Sparta for several years and the executive board of the alliance.
That's why he thinks he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that in the face of current electoral problems, there is the euphoria that ruled during the reign of Ivan Haška.
"Unfortunately, the June Vale Assembly approved positions that were not as perfect as they all thought."
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we had the president since September," Pelta said.
The process of recasting the most important document of the civil society took the form of a workshop for delegates.
"If I become president, I will take this as a personal task and I am willing to carry out my personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principle thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He's still trying not to expose himself to his enemies.
He had previously warned that he could imagine working with Jindrich Reichl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and well knows that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He hasn't even attacked Tomás Paclik for a long time, which, on the contrary, didn't leave a dry spot on Pelt.
"There's something going on in football over the year, he's already got some success."
"But his attacks were undeserved and many people were shocked by the election campaign."
"And that's why a number of them now doubt his real character," he said to the opponent's address Pelta, who remains faithful to the announcements he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competition until after the performance.
She should be the executive box of football.
"And I would also try to put an end to all the affairs beginning with the cause of Bohemians or the sound of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then go to a private and state sector meeting to secure enough money for the whole football," the CHK said forty-six-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his coming to the front of the football would mean no personal cleaning.
"I should first get to know the full of individual employees," he pointed out to the Fearah, where the long-term government is ruled by understandable nervousness.
In the face of the current catastrophic scenarios that are being carried out by the upcoming wave of events, it is believed that no delegates will go to Nymburg on Thursday.
"If it's the only issue of how to choose in the third round, then we can move through it."
"Football needs confidentiality, and it only gets by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains two days ago, perhaps a decisive day of her career as an optimist.
Rachel promises that under him, FACHR would start working hard
If the new president of the Czech Football Association had been elected the current vice-president of Jindrich Reichl for the fourth round assembly, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rachel promises to work hard in his election.
He wants to introduce systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the cause of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue in the work started by former President Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But that's not what I'm saying, I'd do it all by myself," Rachel said in a conversation for the CTBT.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member has certain areas."
"And I'm going to give my hard work so that in each of this segment, football moves about a mile forward."
"Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought he would not run again.
"It's known about me that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will keep throwing sticks under my feet and questioning every step of my life," he explained why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give it up, because then they would give it up."
"It's trust that I can't just throw," he said.
It also motivates him to continue in the work he started with Haske.
"In those two years a big piece of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it now."
"There are started processes that will sound in a couple of years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if the next candidate, Miroslav Pelty, was elected, the situation on the bond could return until the time before Haske.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I think Mirek Pelt doesn't know."
"There are mostly people who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen."
"I can count on a lot of things, but it's certainly not a party."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then they'll be all right and not just the election," said Rachel.
He's also claiming he'd only be Czech President.
"Even if some people are trying to say the opposite, I'm going to do the maximum for Mora."
"For example, it is now time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian parts of which the winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be such a current situation when there are only three Moravian totals in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," said Richl.
Since he also took part in the fight for the president of the Plenary Club Tomáš Paclík, Rachel won't be able to estimate her chances of election.
"But I still feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice-President and sees that I have a clear success," said Raichl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating a lottery law.
On the contrary, he gives himself up to the fact that he doesn't pull the bond by one wire.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from returning to Czech football confidence", the second of Paklíka's opponents is considered a strong candidate who has football to offer.
"No one can doubt that Plzni did a great job this year."
"If he had been elected, he would have continued in the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not, in principle, have changed the personal siege of the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it for his own good," Raichl's rival rating.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
From the view of Ufona, the golf pool in Budapest: Anyone who travels to Europe can enjoy his blue miracle - and after a tour of cities or travel let his tired feet rest in thermal spas.
The book shows where wellness is at the most beautiful water.
When Iris Meder was released in the past one and a half years on public roads, she shouldn't have missed her purse: her swimsuits.
The watermark, looked up to the height of the art-made dome, swam across the marble well (I put a little naked boy, the child (with wings)) waiting for it at the edge of the pool and admired carefully restored secessional vessels.
If she liked some of the craft, she put it in her brain - even with remarkable details about how to build and the history of the building.
More than 200 sailors have examined this way the historical architecture of Meder and now presents them in his recently published book "Badefreuden (Radost of bathing)" : People's Navigations in Munich, the historic palace of sailors in Schwarzwald, "Hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The road to the most unusual spas in Central Europe": next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old Germany is a truly enthusiastic swimmer culture.
With sport it doesn't go too far, says Meder - it's just something else in the water.
In contrast, fan swimming only has to be satisfied with blue petals and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can breathe a puzzling smell of pine forests or listen to the cheerful whistling of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the swimming pools must always be so warm," says Mrs. Meder living in Vienna.
"That's how I started gathering beautiful swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Swimming in the spring pool and essential oil for the sauna - the weather factor is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the sailors could be the real feeder for their eyes: "The place where a person is in a pool of water."
"It's transparent, however, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
It's all optically duplicated: high clenbage, pestrels, jumpers.
The Maloformat image link "Badefreuden" on 190 pages provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis wellnes - but above all, it is a pleasure to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens discovered Mrs. Meder's boat collector during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful medical baths, like 100 years old Szechenya baths in Budapest, she found water with the contents of the mattresses in the original beautiful cave (aisle pool in Miscolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the form of a bottle (Város Termålfürdö in Jászberén).
The beautiful overlooking of it offers many heated swimming pools under the broad sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a person has from the Curysian roof bath in the whole city, the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton can be seen on the snow covered Arlberg - and: In the pools there is a window from which you can see movement on the ski lift.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Langenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the top of the three open canoes in winter, a couple are standing in the background of the Ötztal mountain to the sky.
Alhambra and Schwarzwald
Not every pool collector, Mrs. Meder, walked into the wine cellar.
Many thermal baths are felt by cheese, in the spas of Arpád in Hungary’s Békessaba, it smells like hot oil to the extent that man hardly believes he has gotten into the treatment baths.
Rape comes from medical water with the content of alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose sediments are choking to the skin as soon as only one enters the pool - something special experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and air-conditioning spa Luhačovice, she was in a closed area.
In 1902, architect Dušan Jurkovich designed the bathrooms were closed.
When Mrs. Meder saw the falling windows of the red-white-yellow secession buildings, she saw the possible growth of mud between the tiles.
The Zánik was built against this in a magical boatyard in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These bathrooms already have three stages of construction; one can discover not only the novelty elements from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Maurice shade in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been the favorite spa resort of Mrs. Iris Meder's famous pools, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some kind of performance, connecting such diverse construction structures to such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is obviously a border matter.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the Commodity Trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor.
Then in January, the head of the group wants to draw the results.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the public that 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize, according to one study.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions come out of this trade because it deepens the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of Fors's poll on consumer organization Foodwatch's mandate.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that global commodity stock exchanges are pushing prices up and the banks are therefore co-operating on a global hunger problem.
Consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to ensure that traders were against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, most experts agree that market participants in the capital market with an interest in high risk trading have withdrawn from supply and demand - and have benefited from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: He promised that the prints would be checked and said that no trade "is worth not to have a good reputation for Deutsche Bank in bet".
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Foodwatch-Report Working Group controls.
By the end of the year, the audit will be closed and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to load it.
At the end of January, the representatives of the banks want to report the results.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann works with self-help on his image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "The impact on the rising food prices shows particularly drastic how the bank today is damaging to the general good."
Let Ackermann as the highest bank lobbyist be required.
"Deutsche Bank must scrape out of its portfolio all the items in which money is used for food price bets," Bode said.
"It's wrong if Mr. Ackermann is hungry for people suffering or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's vision appears at first glance as surprising, but it is clear that the group leader would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before he leaves the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of representation would not go to the Supervisory Board other than planned.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about possible losses - he should finally advise his successor.
Any other investment in raw materials would say
Foodwatch is trying to keep a high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have been participating in the campaign.
On Tuesday, he published a poll of Bode, in which 1001 people were questioned by the Institute of Forsa on 7 and 8 November.
According to this, only eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are linked to food price bets.
Many banks would also have a personal impact if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions: each other would, as a result of the survey, make all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 per cent would warn people known to such a bank, 49 per cent indicated that they were thinking about expressing their account and moving to another institution.
21st - century house in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
History of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a Vienna Museum, remained empty and abandoned.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is heated for modern commando architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials that are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an outstanding and celebrated example.
At that time, Schwanzer's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and highly influential construction of steel and glass.
The building has thus far been regarded as a milestone in the modern architecture.
He celebrated the architect so that he built the pavilion of Austria for the next world show.
With its legendary four-bedroom BMW plus as the key to the secondary building in Munich, it was celebrated internationally at the end of 1973.
Its temporary exhibition building, which was designed after the world exhibition, was located in Schweizer Garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), rebuilt and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - it was named "The House of the 20th Century".
But it was not suitable for the museum of the building, either in space or technically - there were no walls to hang artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the current art came to Vienna of a new stage.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been more and more chatting.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the title "The House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum will open its first exhibition - a happy purpose in every respect.
The new start was launched by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a leading art historian with a significant career, including in a young carnival, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has been undergoing a major reconstruction of politics and monuments, has provided public funds and private funds and determined its use.
In addition to contemporary art, works by Fritz Wotruba should be displayed with the same foundation, a coffee shop and a bookshop should be created, and an office building should be built.
Close surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the ideal siege.
Not only did he rebuild and expand the secessional construction of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but he studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna and Pavilion was for him "an extremely important place", where he attended the exhibition "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which, when moving to Vienna and changing its use, had lost its greatness and ease.
At the time of the reconstruction, there were far more problems: the building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of glass facades have been exchanged, used by glass fibers of the insulated glass and the glass roof is replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold steel bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled ceilings have been repaired.
Two underground floors have provided a place for new use, the left lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, the bridge leads to the entrance - almost new building, but still the proud Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door was preserved, the building was drilled in an old red-coloured ton.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was before.
And it's all under the strict supervision of the Memorial Office and the low budget.
"Frequently the material had to be found, which is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office," Krischanitz says and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It's hard to say it was with a pavilion "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, the typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is probably "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "be proper self-conscious".
In this case, however, the House is not in the wrong place for the 21st century, as the urbanist happy coincidence has occurred: around Schweizer Garden there is a completely newly designed "City District at the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there is another happy chance: The house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporāre Kunshalle and, as you can hear, already has one with the city of the neighborhood in the resort in Schweizer Garden.
The road is planning a package for the winter crisis of millions
The road blew up a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll be millions.
In the fight against winter train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than EUR 70 million in the news this year.
News "Bild" has previously reported that it is estimated to be around EUR 300 million by 2015 with investments in total.
It is intended to improve the use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external workers per 16,000 persons to remove snow on railway facilities and train stations.
The aim is to remove the starting point for the operation and 90% for the operation of the necessary moves over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, chief of the Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives before train and delays also during this winter.
In the last winter, road traffic had significant problems because, among other things, there was a lack of reserve under difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years for the approval of the Spolkov Railway Authority.
In addition, there is a delay in running ICE trains
The road has also failed for years to show that ICE train repairs are likely to be more frequent when it comes to one ICE train at the Cologne main station to destroy the repair.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of bribes in the United States
After a riot around Chief Joseph Ackermann, there are new trams in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank did not have enough problems at home, it was still in the field of its past in the United States: the Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million in one balancing operation (106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large corporate banks in the course of the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgages.
NCUA’s financial market regulator is counting on a number of large banks that have misled the social banks with false promises to buy financial products; that risks have probably decreased.
Such papers have lost much of their value during the crisis and have thrown banks into ruin with them.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," said the spokesperson for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt when it's settled.
It also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the sensitivity of both financial institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for corporate banks in the United States and helps with bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get a refund for the resulting billions of damage.
Now the final equations are the first of their kind.
The regulator also relied on other major banks and complained about JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
In the case of suspicious mortgages, the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bubble collapsed around the property in 2007, it became a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though the event came a few years ago, now it's going to blow the banks in a sharp wind.
The investors and the supervisory authorities have filed a number of complaints in order to correct or raise doubts.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) dropped the largest wave of complaints.
It is up to 18 international banks that two American state financiers dealing with properties Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage trades amounting to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face the FHFA complaint, which deals with more than $14.2 billion in total between 2005 and 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses", but not to specify an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and claimed he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffet enters with 10 billion to IBM
The financial guru Buffet invests potentially in IBM IT.
Since March, he has bought a stock worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, a significant American investor Warren Buffet has always declared that it will not invest in IT and computers because long-term development of companies is only difficult to predict.
However, now he has read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand a long time ago that IBM was offering services in particular and was setting up computer systems for the IT department of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is regarded as a match on the knight.
As a result, it is now possible to call the mother horn IT IBM "Sir IBM".
Because Buffet invented in the US economic advertising station CNBC that since March he bought a $10.7 billion share of IBM.
His Investment Holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said IBM didn't know anything about his commitment until now.
He praised the management that was trying to achieve economic crisis even with good results.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
For a long time, IBM has been investing in lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than 100-year-old computer forwarder also offers software and advice as well as executive computers for companies.
Buffet with technology companies has been more out of line to this day.
It claims to invest only in companies whose activities are also understood.
Instead, Buffet sat on the freighter's railway, on the masculine manufacturer or on the manufacturing machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 own subsidiaries also participated in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rüg.
Mr. 81-year-old took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built out of it one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
This is why it is a cultural attitude for many investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Arakel of Omaha" (The Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock stood at one percent before the stock market started.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is traded with Apple and Microsoft for the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, so many Buffetts, he wouldn't want to be.
Founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The danger is mateable
After the discovery of "Bunny in Zwickau", the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The news is even talking about "blood ideology", which is now reliving.
The murders of eight small businesses of Turkish origin and one Greek in 2000 to 2006 had a legitimately extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkey population in Germany, the report reacted with fear and anxiety.
For many of the German Turks, this brings back the horror long considered dead: from the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable violence with the right extremist background.
That there was a xenophobia in Germany, but there was never a doubt about it.
However, the right-wing extremist network reveals the extent to which the dimensions can no longer be monitored.
"Is the blood ideology alive again?" the headlines of the internet edition of Turkish news "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper Sabah emphasises that one of the contractors should be a secret police officer for the protection of the constitution and fears that the German authorities too could be involved in the right-wing radical misdemeanor.
The Turkish council of Germany responded with a considerable response: she recalled the weekend demonstration of silence in front of the Brandenburg draft of the victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish council in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish policies, recalled the commemorative act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish assembly agreement.
In happy colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
As a pole here, the news media has several Turkish media: "Darek Germany to the 1950s" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken away from this thought connection.
"It's starting to dawn," the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and their work were murdered and made a significant contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is discussed in German internet forums the police process and its late success in the investigation.
Why the German authorities did not come up long ago to be admired by the authors after suspected patrols in the right extremistic circles.
Thus many are presented at least rhetorically ready to use the drastic means: "If there is still such an activity on the surface, there will be nothing other than our own defence and weapons for immigrants."
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of the explanation and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the inner peace in Germany," says "Selen."
Which means if the domestic peace in Germany is threatened, the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain.
The photo of the burning place in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has shown here to the living Turks it is clear that there is a formidable danger here and to the Germans that disbelief and retreat can lead to legal violence
However, the assassinations on the Turkish side made the feeling of each other more sensitive.
Do not repeat past errors
At the time, the Turkish press particularly criticised the failure of the German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit you in Mölln, who survived.
After the intense attack in Solingen, he sent a compassionate telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech to calculate what charges the Turkish people paid here.
Just like a person's value is measured according to the amount of his tax.
The current Turkish media reports show once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in this state law.
In addition to a comprehensive explanation and a new assessment of the right to extreme terrorism in Germany, this calls for open words this time.
The scandal bank at Lake Curyška
The most generous bank in Europe has no seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered from a financial crisis almost bankrupt and from one crisis to another since then.
Now a German has to compare it.
Then Axel Weber certainly didn't mean it.
Following his deaf departure from the leadership of the Spolk Bank, it became known in July that 2013 will take place in almost the same spectacular new job: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber was delighted in the public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The UBS has reached its orbit."
"I'm looking forward to working with Kaspar Villeger and Oswald Grubel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London went through all of the bank's security systems and spent about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of UBS representation Oswald Grubel, not only a renowned banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Governing Council has been as strong as possible - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber bank has been allowed to work since February 2012.
And let's take over the Presidency of the Governing Council in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's gonna be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he'd definitely need time to work.
Let us then assume responsibility for the Bank's strategy, which has once again proved to deserve the title "The Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
However, the UBS is huge - until recently was the world's largest asset manager - but it has been on track for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will remain a proud Swiss bank saved.
It started out as a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also the intelligent manager of the property is combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to mean something in the investment banking industry.
The 2007 UBS thus fixed on one side with $1.6 billion more money for rich customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks
It made sense.
A former banker and later a long-term banking professor at Curych Hans Geiger will report: "I used to tell my students at the time UBS as an example of a good bank."
"From today's perspective, one asks, "How could I have been so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it was obvious that something in the UBS had turned out well.
In the middle of the year, Peter Woffli was surprised to see the head of the representation, who had so far been regarded as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he wondered why he left.
The Investment Division of the Bank has been sending subprime papers and has had to write off billions.
To stop this, UBS reported an increase in capital of really 13 billion francs.
That is why she found investors, however, that she would have recently covered her nose: a transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so discreet that no one knew her name.
But it was just the first attack.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to admit new billions of losses, the president of the management board Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid management board in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS had become a failure to invest in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank has bought out UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs to a legally convertible bond that could be a co-operator of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks in its territory.
Finally, the balance sheet of the 2007 UBS was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS once again," says bank expert Geiger.
The second one is going down on the first disaster.
For several months, UBS has been capitalizing on this in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to issue data from rich customers who, if possible, have been taxed with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a refund of undue profits from these transactions, including fines.
By doing so, UBS found itself more or less open to help reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that was repulsive to her capital in the competition for rich customers: the saint of discretion.
After this scandal, Switzerland's banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
The delegation of the Head of Representation and the President of the Board of Directors was followed.
And the customer's exodus money.
Thus the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over several months: in investment banking due to poor speculation and property management to help reduce tax evasion.
And just when it calmed down again, just when it was thought that the UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate commercial anababs came here: the only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, it is likely that it is still not.
"Adololi's case probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and financial professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German bank is also sure: "The UBS problem lies in its failure to control the risks."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers stepped up a long time ago to become observers of the world's big assets: no too high a risk, so the security for money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic has grown again.
Swiss banks' vaults have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high quality chocolate.
The UBS Centre in Curychu is still suitable for a cliché of good Swiss private banks - it's just a little bigger.
It's already classic.
The bank has its main seat in the Turkish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curysh Lake, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental of shops is one of the highest in Europe.
Clothing like Tiffany's is found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli sugar.
From the National Bank through the Palace der Credit Suisse to the elite private bank like Julius Bär.
UBS is entering the reception hall with heavy turning doors.
Inside are walls covered with marble, facing them with possible leather chairs, next to the bank's logo a large direction towards "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
This idea, however, was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by the Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as found by the head of one small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he finally closes up, like all Swiss bankers, as well as both major banks.
UBS seems to have increased too much, finding out - especially in the investment banking industry, where the Anglos also expanded.
The Swiss probably don't have anything to say.
"If only they'd adapted to English ways."
Indeed, it was the investment banking industry in England that changed the UBS, led to high profits first and then a collapse: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven million country moved to the greatest rescue action in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If he's talking to Swiss bankers, he sees a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks joined a powerful group.
A bank that was already too big for small Switzerland in the merger has risen - and has continued to grow.
However, it helped that both different bank predecessors of UBS were complemented by: One rich but sleeping bank in Curych with weight in property and poorer but internationally more involved.
Suddenly, internationalised investment bankers benefited from a lot of money that could solve the big deal.
With this rise, UBS has two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of the UBS and Marcel Ospel Group, then the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team of futures," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble one who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who runs his feelings around a stomach that has been completely developed from banking science."
But Ospel relied on Wuffli at the end.
And at the end, Wuffli probably admitted decisive mistakes: "I guess he thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear, pride was before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of the leading employees, on which the group leader Wuffli repeated the same password all the time: Strike Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She said "League Tables", an officer who documented the success of the bank at the time.
She was trying to get UBS up there.
A few steps have already happened to her.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she took part in the games up top.
However, business advisers who have been entrusted stress one weakness: In international interest trading, in the term "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a great gap between the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, the UBS decided on an adventure that almost became its existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and its fund to secure the risk to the US investments of Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that wrapped up valuable papers on American mortgage loans and passed on - but it also kept its own risk.
Even when the other banks were looking for the east.
"Even in 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, there UBS was buying," says bank expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, how deep it falls.
One manager after the other had to leave when trying to clean up was harder than he thought.
The positions at the UBS have become a catapulting seat, and to this day they jump.
Whoever runs the big bank now has almost incapacitated jobs.
He must find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has the idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
So far the bank doesn't want to go.
But the investment banking is going to kill a lot, so far it's clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of Sergio Ermotti's bank wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italy was actually understood as only a transitional solution when the bank suddenly broke up with former Grubel.
Meanwhile, he insisted: He has a long time to run UBS stores, the Turkish bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its position in the mid-1980s.
3500 places to take off.
That won't be enough.
UBS needs a visa.
Who's she?
What does he want to make money for?
These are the questions Axel Weber is already asking.
Publicly, he's just saying he's gonna find his lady's apartment in Curych.
Next year.

In particular, the financial values were found on the sales pages.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values recorded a 0.6 per cent decrease in trade at 12,078 points.

In September, companies produced two per cent less than in the month preceding, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
"We're no island, but depend," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe is probably not turning out of recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
The legend of Warren Buffet's investment confirmed this view: in one CNBC-interview, he said it would probably not be clear if Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
This is why it is likely that it is too soon to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffet left the old principle for decades and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM has increased the share price of the traditional group and has allowed it to grow by almost one per cent higher against the trend in the course of trade.

Smart Gates Expanding in Cities
In many places the crows are considered to be "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be thrown out of the city long ago, hard experts say.
Some of them like to get rid of them quite quickly: The gates already belong to the city’s image for centuries, yet in some villages there are people complaining about the uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
There is, however, no way against "problem birds" to date under the supervision of some means.
The Havanas will probably not be able to get out of the city anymore, the experts at the first symposium on the gates in East African Leer.
There, experts from all over the community consulted on possible Eastern areas.
Looking for alternatives in cities
The nature defenders, however, also removed the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected fields: The use of chemistry in agriculture is likely to destroy the traditional area for life.
The persecution, growing construction and planting of typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
The gates are protected.
A large colony with more than 600 nesting pairs are, inter alia, in the West Soeste, in the northwest, inter alia, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bré and Leer.
There, in 2005 he launched a controversial project of mass killing of crows during the rural period of negative title.
Critics have marked the capture of animals into pastures for birds and the killing of claws especially brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, nothing brings," said the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klover of Leer.
The removal of nests by water injection or trees has often had adverse consequences, said also environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Badensk-Württemberg.
"The animals are retreating, the great colony is scurried and divided into other places."
Fear is just an exception in hospitals, in-house pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get away with them."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of the city cannot be solved, was the opinion of Archbishop Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is thoughtable to combine the removal of animals from sensitive habitats and their attraction to settle elsewhere.
"The information table instead of chain pills" promoted against this psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment with animals: "We can at last stop by ourselves."
Ms Jürgens has co-founded a scientific path in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg, which provides an information table on the life of a highly intelligent pilot.
In the meantime, the project is already open to tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise caused by the bird, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and beauty of animals are legendary: the Havrani Polni do not only use help to reach the Pamles, but even as a help, they will make their own tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the behavior of four hummingbirds, how far the bird’s intelligence is.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones must bring the construction to the larvae.
Without great training they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause a collapse of the plates.
In the second attempt, the nailed gates had to solve a more brilliant problem.
In a civil war, researchers placed a small container with a clay larva.
They couldn't reach the birds with their eyes.
However, researchers put pieces of wire there.
All four of them were made from hooks, with the help of the tugs hunting from the tube of the container for the holder.
Three of the four Polish harrans even managed with the strike.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks have not been raised.
Favorite Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine at Play-off matches.
Leaded by a double- succeeding superstar Cristiano Ronald (8, 53.) beat Portugal Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the first match the fifth match in order to complete Europe's championship.
The Czechs had enough in play-off with the outside Black Hora result 1:0 (0:0) when the first match was clear.
The market did not even have Croatia with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) gave other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Colk League Star Misimovic changed penalty (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed in the 2010 World Cup games in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Light Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese began peacefully.
Ronaldo quickly managed to hang a free pile from about 30 meters to the net.
On a good quarter later, Nani presented his qualities in the shooting at a long distance and adjusted the 25-meter trefole to 2:0.
The Bosnians who didn't do the first half had their first clear chance at Edin Jack's locker.
The former Wolfsburu player in the head of the Manchester City stand table set the head ball at the bottom of the board in April, but the ball did not exceed the branch line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, he stood at the centre of decision Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After the action against Helder Postigo in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36).
On the other hand, Stark carried out a controversial criminal act following the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic certainly changed.
But after the break, the European Vice-President of 2004 explained everything with four tremors.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended up in 81 minutes with the latest doubts.
This is what Europe's champion from 1976 to the fifth in line to the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilka's team with the Legionary of the Bundesligy Michael Kadlec (Bayer Levrkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.
Brankář Petr Čech has been reflexically prevented in the last moment by his own armour Tomáš Sivoka (9.).
Black Hora had its greatest chance when Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired within 40 minutes from the border of the criminal area just right around the Czech branch.
After the break, it had to be a great deal of time to save the place of the already defeated Czech world-class marketer, once again reducing the attacker FC Soul (50.).
The branch, shortly before the conclusion, finally explained everything.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at the time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul did not exceed Turkey in Zagreb status 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has his seat on the third world championship in 2002, Croatia must enjoy its fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimira Stadium, Turkey should enjoy almost a historic start.
Selcuk Ian shot in the seventh minute shot from a distance just a bullet, the attacker Kazim could not also hang the mirror ball in the gates.
After this terrible second, Croatia was taken over, but still more and more control.
They also didn't get the Croatian branch after the interruption.
In addition to Mario Mandzuccie from VfL Wolfsburg, who has been releasing Dortmund Ivan Perisice for 62 minutes, there were still legionnaires from the Colk League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt).
Trapatoni goes to the Championship of Europe
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated its first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who took care of the success of 4:0 in the first match already on the preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) was equal to the guests.
Ireland was at the beginning of the pace, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only recently that Estonian defenses were prevented from leading the dam.
In the 32nd minute, it was far away.
After the failed defense of the London marketer Paul Ward was on the scene and pushed the ball across the line to stage 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China.
The largest software producer in Europe SAP invests in China's next billion years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about $2 billion (approximately €1.5 billion) had flown, and Dax announced on Tuesday.
"We will create further research and development facilities and employ relevant workers," said Deputy Chief Bill McDermott at the Beijing customer fair.
The population is now growing from the current 2500 employees to 4,500.

Massacre at personal level
An emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund entitled Beauty and Consolation: The True History of First World Wars (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of emerging characters as you get stuck in your head.
One advice on how to maintain yourself at this time: Take care to remove this page and make it a cover.
You will be very familiar with all the people in Mr. Englund's novel story and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a Mayak - at times when you will feel like men and women in the story of confusion and loss in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new substitute for the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite neatly, as "antihistoric work".
It contains a number of very well-known names, important contracts or famous beats; on the contrary, it contains almost lack of ambassadors, energy journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's not even the book about what happened, the author explains, like the book about what it was.
"Beautiful and bitter" combines the war experiences of 20 more less dense men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to after-the-clock, doctors, rescue drivers and officers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flutter like candles lit in church - new ones are added to the coincidence of fate while others are thrown away.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
He manages the idea that the first world war was just a terrible funeral fight on the West Front.
"Beauty and grief" explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book deal with the problems of having the bee nest on them, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramid or facing the presence of flies.
It's a very touching reading almost from the beginning.
The war will devour people's lives like some natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling gunfire.
When you start shooting at work in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting close?
Nearly no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was torn apart.
"Vakuum arising from a lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "has been filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fams."
"Beauty and grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from biographies, letters and other published material.
Their descriptions of their lives may sound scary and fascinating, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are completely alive and credible.
Many of them argue about suffering and dealing with him.
In a German student's story, the author says: "Insurances, everywhere."
"Coffee of coffee, like aluminium, rubber imitations, paper bonds, wooden buttons."
She's still going on and she's describing food replacements in Germany.
It refers to "mass made from liquefied rice cooked in a wood pulp (and supplemented by false bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, boots with wooden spoons".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds in it the inner impulses to savagery and brutality, which says about war: "At last you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or good books and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that behind it, I don't hide any barbarism in nitre."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon and no one notices it, so to grieve.
"If a person finally makes peace with the sacrifice, he would at least wait for it to happen in front of the eyes of the grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he seems like a "defendant who secretly hangs him."
Further comments concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new threats.
"The conflict has become more economic competition and competition," says Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He caught what he says "the new kind of beast of the coming century: a remarkable and ideologically wreaked mass murderer in the shirts carved at peace, which carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpected, subjugated with pride.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who have deliberately tried to catch a sexually transmitted disease to avoid service on the front.
"The most gruesome example of this behavior was the trade with gonococcal rage that soldiers bought and swallowed their genitalia in hopes of ending in the hospital," he writes.
"You're the most reliable one who's ever got him into the eye, which has often blinded him to the end of his life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Gravese, Mr. Englund's prose is fresh, but not so obvious, which fits his human theme perfectly.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which the war "demonstrated totally insurmountable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leadership is forced to fight.
The best books about the first world war were mostly more than the complete story they worked with signs, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussella or the Romans as "On the West Front Peace" by Erich Marie Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most confusing weddings that are not held in popular scientific literature.
But I won't betray him to you.
But you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled a page out of the list of heroes out of your hand and burned it.
After the previous error this time for a minute exactly scheduled time
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some of whom were used in street riots.
Monday night on Tuesday was chosen because Zuccitti Park should be almost empty at the time.
No one knew about the action except for a few highly established officers, and the others were first told that it was a practice.
The action led by police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases of recent weeks should not be repeated when, for example, the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators was violated by the rules of the department and, in addition, the wave of public sympathy was shifted to the side of the squatters.
That is why a police operation aimed at clearing Zucctti Park from demonstrators was initiated up to two weeks after careful planning and exercise.
The leaders allowed themselves to be inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive exercises in case of crisis behaviour took place in the Randalls Island part, which was prepared for action in Zuccitti Park.
The leaders have reinforced so-called training to suppress anxiety - counter-terrorist measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of policemen - with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" someone said that the action was originally only explained as "training".
"I know a couple of policemen who were also called to this action, and certainly no one told them that they were going to Zaccotti Park," said the person who spoke only if he remained anonymous.
"On going to Zaccotti Park, they only knew the highest position of a member of the department."
One of the reasons for the concealment was the lesson that the city had received once.
On 14 October, representatives of the city had to clean up the park plan, but then they dropped from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they were included before the start of the operation into the park for the whole century.
Utter action was attended by police from various units, including intervention groups from around - dozens of police officers who are usually used to strengthen the quarter with higher crime levels.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, there's a lot of people coming into the park and leaving again, so one hour at night was the perfect time for the action to start.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when it would be in the park as many people as possible," he said.
Before the units expressed themselves, they arranged on the street edge of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, freight trains of emergency units with skylights and amplifications.
The light and the recorded message from the amplifications of many demonstrators scared.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue breezes, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
The police claim that until 1:45 in the morning she didn't touch the only state she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things up.
Other police teams were watched as they gathered at the park's edge so they could get into it if there was a need to make an arrest.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief spokesperson of the police department Paul J. Browne claimed that this was for their safety.
However, many journalists hold the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and also some policemen were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street leading along the west border of the park could be filmed without problems.
The police went west, and they got mixed up with a huge mix of personal protesting things, including bags and Igelite bags full of clothes, and they were followed by teams from the medical department who immediately buried everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documentary imaging material appeared shortly after.
The most vulnerable group of demonstrators fled to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some have created a conspiracy, and the police have initiated their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people joined the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of emergency services were called to rescind locks.
By 3:30 a.m., there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "the organisation of emergency and the placing of resistance during arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the police department, was the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation also took part personally in Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Detectives at the Department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't share in operating," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of police were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, were mentioned.
From these places the police have developed a protective belt even further from Zuccitti Park.
At one place, policemen were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, as people were still pushing beyond that border.
There were about 28 people on the north border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning, one protestor was seen south of Pine Street, as he jumped out on the hood of the police car, and several others who fired air from the tires of the police delivery.
In one moment, a piece of the crossbow came out of the pond.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestant were hospitalized.
The union of assistant workers will appeal to the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants, who lost their jobs last month, are planning to appeal to the city on Wednesday. They claim that leave was not necessary and that it was discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The Court of Justice is probably the last option left to the District Council 37 committees in their attempt to reverse the decision on release.
On 7 October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other staff members who were among the highest paid city employees lost their jobs. Their release was described by the city's leading committees as a payroll for not having been able to access the health care fund managed by the staff members of the city in the spring, with the help of which the city wanted to make a hole in the budget.
The city’s representatives categorically rejected this accusation.
At a meeting of the City Council last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council immediately argued that the budget did not specifically address the release of auxiliary workers.
The representatives of the District Council 37 announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would be suing her. On Wednesday, they issued a press conference, where they formally announced the complaint to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
The defendants will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the complainant will be eight released workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, the spokesperson of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a lawsuit yet, and that is why she will not be able to make any accusations.
According to the proposal for a complaint that succeeded in obtaining the New York Times, the committees focused on the number of people left in poor parts of the city who wanted to support their claims about unfair conduct.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island part did not give up at all and in the Upper East Side only at least, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost and 46 assistants were released in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
He recalls that at the School of Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it is a school where 68 per cent of students live in poverty. The complaint says: "It is not a neighborhood full of speaking parents who can raise funds to offset the budget deficit."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year and the school also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus finances for every registered poor student.
In addition, the committees argue that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which the document approving the release of parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the teacher's move from the school's payroll to the available employees' database whose salary is played by the central authority.
"Sixty parents' coordinators were released," says the complaint proposal, "and not just moved to the database to the position of available workers."
Mission is at the end, Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to agree on something concerning the rise in Libya.
Before that happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Kadddafi had to be arrested and killed and the U.S. troops killed.
On Tuesday, the Commission on International Relations of the Senate will decide on a statement by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which he should congratulate the Libyans on their successful rise and the American units for their "statehood".
"By this declaration we want to assess the courage of the Libyans who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The above words may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has ever been easy.
Over the years, lawmakers on both sides have consistently negotiated with the White House a series of declarations to approve or reject the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented resolutions permitting the limited use of US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the Snow Hall because of the different views of both political parties, so it had never been voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in Snowhouse, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of American operations in Libya.
The US mission in Libya literally felt in the legislative clean-up - Congress criticised the way President Obama runs the mission, but his members obviously did not hesitate enough to stop supporting him in his work.
The importance of the convention finally came to an end.
In August, the rebels won Tripoli, and on October 20, Kaddafi was killed.
Miss Nato officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations, in its declaration, "congrats the Libyans for their unmistakable courage and awe-scrupulousness, which they have imposed in an attempt to free their people" and "glorify men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary strength and professionalism."
The declaration also "confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be redeployed to two-half, as was the case when the June proposal was adopted?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), chief representative of the Republican Party, was set up against the latest version.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he hasn't seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
This week there will be a vote on an addendum to the Constitution which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, pursued by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addendum to the Budget or other subject matter to be voted on by the whole House or the Senate.
The other legislators have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals to the vote on their own.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 additions to the constitution that were presented at the convention and touched on the wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same – the same proposal presented to the House and to the Senate – and others are only minor exchanges.
Only 15 versions of the balanced budget add-on and another item that would like to "regulatory federal expenditure" can be found in the Snowhouse.
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The proposal for the regulation of the budget, approved in August, called for the addition to the balanced budget to be voted by the Snymovna and the Senate.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration to support the creation of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the number of periods during which members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be held by the President.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a whole series of supplements that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The long-term proposal remains an addition banning the marriage of couples of the same sex and an addition banning the burning of the State flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws in the event of two thirds of the states being set up against them.
Although the members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various supplements, they do not significantly deviate from the average compared to the previous years.
At 111th Congress, 77 additionals were offered, while at 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activities are even pale in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s, when, according to the statistics, the senate library members offered more than 150 additionals every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than today's politics.
The last addendum added - 27th addendum - was ratified in 1992, but actually the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Blowed, but not beaten," said Gifford in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after she was hit by an immediate shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declared that more than a return to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" series at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the production of seeds was still causing problems and needed help while walking.
The entire series documented her difficult rehabilitation, which was necessary for the injury caused by the bullet that struck her in front of her skull, penetrated her left half of her brain, and went out of her head.
Three months ago she suddenly returned to the Snow Hall to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview from the ice shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords laughed, laughed and sang, describing his recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford answered 40 years of age, "Very well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour special part of the "20/20" series, which was broadcast in the evening of the release of this couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: History of Courage and Hope".
The Special has been monitoring the entire Gifford reconvalescence since the 8th of January.
On the videos that Kelly recorded during the first week, it's to see Giffords in a hospital bed with his head shaved and a long scar across his forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers at that time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapist teaches her how to perform simple activities.
Headache.
Oral spray.
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she needed changes in her breakfast.
The video from the ABC station shows that the role of complaint for the recovery of Gifford's music: Congressman sings on them along with a melody therapist to the song "Girls Just Wanda Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
During the interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day on therapy, Sawyer found out he didn't remember anything since the day he got shot.
Her husband said that Gifford had read news articles about the shooting by March 12th, when she first asked him who was the sixth woman who was killed during the incident.
From the shooting is a suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missouri, where under the influence of violent medications, he is awaiting trial.
"Many people died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Hungry, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer found out that in one moment his wife said during reconvalence: "I lost."
"So I told her right away: Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got the truck.
But you can do it, you can get together, and you'll get back even stronger than ever."
Military units meet more with compassion than with respect.
This event was a gala night on Wall Street that made millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors were running around him.
The well - dressed man stood up and was excited.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who arranged the spring benefit.
He also took part in the celebration evening, and in addition to him was Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units in a slightly different way.
"They were all represented as napping orphans," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought it was good.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect.
So completely wrong impressions just illustrate an easy relationship between an army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is unarmed with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, soldiers say.
The public behaves more and more like a unit in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led units in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to make us into the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or show themselves to the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face was much worse when they returned from Vietnam.
As a result, most words of pity are conveyed in silence and in private among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat activities where they served as members of the maritime forces, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at them from two angles.
From the standpoint of some, they will feel respect and awe because they have defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic sites.
In other words, he will turn his head if "no evil, violent veteran under the surface is covered," said Cancian, who took part in Iraq's fights and after his return took place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who were interviewing him were insistently indicating whether he could cope with the stress associated with his work in Washington soon after his return.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count with negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The concerns of the army are partly derived from the American greed for war.
The success of the battlefield only rarely leads to recognition in a country that has only a small awareness of its own army and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finds only little of its own benefit.
"As a nation we no longer consider military heroism as it used to be during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in the arms.
Soldiers are designated for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to strike strongly against rape
This week, it will be decided whether 28 women and men will be tried against the army for alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other proposers are prepared to file a complaint.
The first class of soldiers Elizabeth Lyman was on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague for 25 years and was pregnant at the 11th week.
It happened in October 2008 and she went to the airline at Miramar Airport in the north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend, she attacked her male colleague with a 12 beer box.
He asked her if she could join her so they could have a drink in her room.
"In my head there was a warning light," Lyman wrote.
But the native Texasan totally ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, her husband walked over to her, threw her to bed and raped her.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the army will be waiting for the verdict of hearings that could have a historical impact. This will be played in Arlington, Virginia, and it will discuss whether the charge against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The charge states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed in the fight against the spread of violence in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The charge was filed in February by Washington lawman Susan Burke and the complainant had 17 members at the time. However, during the following months their number grew to 28-25 women and three men who all claimed that they had been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army had failed to investigate, punish, and any hunt for justice.
Burke claims he's going after the highest-ranking military commanders, because the problem is starting with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to introduce measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of the other complaints submitted in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than collecting all the accusations in this case - she put all eggs in one basket, as she says herself - she will file complaints in several cases if pressure is not to be absorbed.
The Defence Department's defence team is headed by the U.S. State Representative Neil MacBride, who, together with his collaborators, encouraged the rejection of the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek provide a detailed discussion of the defence strategy - in principle, the fact is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for the injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court Regulation, Feres Doctrine is not a federal government responsible for the injury suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military services of the complainants," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused to speak on this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in the fight, it is only a matter of speaking: in modern wars, it is only difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troops played an even more significant role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two thirds of them directly in battle.
It's time for modernization in the army, too, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veterinary Seminar on Legal Services prepare a complaint to the four main military academy for the alleged development of an atmosphere conducive to hatred for women.
Regardless of the non-profit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans, it collects the basis for its anti-military appeal. This complaint focuses on the diagnosis of "failure of personality", which was allegedly found in victims of rape to have an army shut down for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, who belong to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a completely common practice.
Her group had already filed a motion in December against the State Organisation for the Treatment of Veterans, which she accused of discriminatory practices which should have come to the point of processing requests for assistance from persons who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented, which were presented by a group of senators and Members from both sides and proposed a whole series of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3 158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 incidents in the year.
The report issued in March also shows the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: 20 per cent of cases reported in the army were brought before the court in 2010 - half against the civil justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the plaintiffs describe the attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
For example, the first-class army in Lyman reported alleged rape of the military police not an hour after it was due.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat details of her rape to 11 different police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to identify rape and found in her bed a bloodthirsty attacker - from the wound she had done on the guard.
About six months later, in April 2009, Lyman completed the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions as to whether she had been in love with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify for the sake of the alleged offender who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day when judgment was brought," says Lyman.
"I felt like I was having a baby right there -- screaming out of the courthouse."
"They put me on a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his judgment.
Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who had finally diagnosed a personality disorder that he described as ineffective.
In January 2010, she was released from the army with no honour and therefore without claim to benefit.
Whether the Lyman case or the other plaintiffs move to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University.
However, he notes, "From my perspective, you should be able to step into further stages of discussion."
But between them and verdict there is this doctrine, which has been criticized since the first time that the light of the world has seen.
I'm the lifetime critic of the Doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army is several decades behind because their duties do not allow the same level of motivational incentives and determinants.
He adds, "The odds are hard on them... but it's important for them to try."
Only when good people are willing to fight will change.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoá, the complainant's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons who are prepared to file a complaint and will start working on other cases relating to this matter.
"Let's not stop the army fighting in this matter from where reform is not coming," he says.
Or until we die, according to what's coming.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-priest opinions on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murder warrant, after which 77 were dead in Norway, participated in his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in the cyberspace area: during the attack he spent a lot of time with his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the legal group on social media sites.
After the tragedy this year, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - enough to go out on Facebook.
"We realized that getting them isn't really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British research team on European digital populism.
Personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, Bartlett says it was enough for scientists to simply use advertising on the pages, and because of this, they have precisely identified the population group they are looking for - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe has found half a million right-wing fans, focusing on them and sending them advertisements. However, instead of calling them to a newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they called for them to fill out a questionnaire that raised questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett observes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online rights groups are all young men who support an increasing degree of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends covering state updates, contributions to walls and pressed "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides on average three different data, which from this social network does the word "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, whose name is Facebook, has risen against the condition of almost 800% five years ago.
For some scientists, Facebook's magic is that it allows them to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It was a long time ago that when you wanted to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should get to a party where you would never be left," says Bartlett.
"This is all about Facebook - you're just going straight to them."
Another argues that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who had taken their drinking out on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Morenová proposes that the students on the site monitor and come with an offer of help to a student who publishes too much drinking status.
"The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and Director of the Centre for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify the children who are in danger that we should not have a chance to find out."
Facebook is constantly investigating data from its users.
The information team prepared statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the nation's satisfaction ratio (mainly using the information to which they had access - internet freedom defenders have long claimed that the website should have access to its information treasure for research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - in exchange for the possibility of playing Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide its personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect offline data. However, online data are accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users would think scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using public facebook walls of his students.
"When it comes to them, they take it in such a way that information is only between them and their friends."
Finally, consideration should also be given to the issue of methodology.
Even in offline research there is no guarantee that the subject is entirely honest.
On Facebook there is no way to verify how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," explains Selwyn.
That is why Selwin, who spent many years researching new technologies, believes that the pen and recorder still remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Societal research should be about society and social activities - and the hell a lot of social activities are still going off-line."
"Frozen and non-human": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public prosecution
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to setting up two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, during his first public hearing in Oslo described himself as a "defense fighter".
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian temple knights," he told the court where 500 people were gathered.
"I object to the court because the mandate has been given to you by hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I don't admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could vote."
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought his speech with him, to allow his relatives to speak to him at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned any contact with the media for 4 minutes and announced that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all his correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some have come to hope that they will be able to look into Breivik's eyes, others to make sure he's held firmly under the castle.
Everyone took part in moving the case to a rapid closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," he told the NRK commentator one of the survivors of the attack.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say to myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved mentally a little further."
Breivik, in dark clothing and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and going to the building without any difficulty looking at the present journalists and surviving into the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he is part of a larger movement of "resistance", the judge found that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any partner.
For someone, it can be a comfort that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sorrow and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish she'd look like a creature, but it's not," said the relative of one of the victims.
"If so, everything would be much simpler."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie about cinema this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear, and they chose him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
For all fans of Apple this week, the recently reopened Job's interview, which was dedicated to a special movie that is going to film this week, will be the fact that his creative mind fully understood the trade processes and workflows that are behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a sleigh and a self-proclaimed member of hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who had every detail in the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffered "the fact that a really great idea is from 90% of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent result product is still a long way to go."
In 1995 Bob Cringely worked on the TV series Triumf of computer wizards, who discussed personal computer learning. During the film he played a unique, more than an hourly conversation.
At that time it had been ten years since Jobes was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands working with his new computer company NeXT, and he looked impatiently at how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the TV series, only a short part of the entire Cringely conversation was finally used and the original copies of the interview were betrayed that they were lost during transport.
Shortly after Job's death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
Just this material, slightly cut, forms the basis of a 68-minute picture of Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which is going to the selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has expressed his feelings about giving further talks here, Jobes is even surprised to learn that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the discussion, there will be a further pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is seen how Jobes' answer perfectly thinks to be the most powerful and precise.
There are also moments when Job's perfectionism flows on the surface, when, in the case of Cringel's questions, he acts impatiently and moves him to get to the most important problems and topics faster.
The interview was even before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone and there are frightening prophetic thoughts in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing good and bad, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job's post-mortem evaluation of his career, but at Job's, which we see here as a pilot sleeper in the bloom of his genius, there's something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision here of how things might and should look.
It didn't take long, and after he said his thoughts, he also started to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seventh scene from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run the company:
"During the years of the business, I always asked myself, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer was always the same: 'Well, that's just what you're doing.'
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never think deeply about business.
I found out.
Jobs continues to describe its efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused about the way the costs were recorded - often started with "standard costs", he could only think about their height. At that time he decided to go his own way - developed an automatic tool that ensured that commercial costs could be determined during a moment.
As he carried out the grower on the papacy:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box", which was created by Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to effectively get into the telephone company and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
The device was already written in the past, but Job’s enthusiasm when the Blue Box describes it as a tool of power is literally contagious.
They will tell how Wozniak and Vozniak tested using paid phone and during the call they were able to connect from one AT&T network to another while using the largest number of satellites.
"At least half a time we've gotten so crowded around the world, so when we've shouted something on the pay phone, it's just a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobes laughs.
"We were young and found out that we were able to do something ourselves that is capable of managing the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a little thing that was able to control a much larger picture - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never come up without it.
Jobes continues a description of the joke that Wozniak and Wozniak almost reached the end. By means of the Blue Box in the middle of the night they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, while they were best placed for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, they were called on to speak to the U.S. diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up the Pope himself, the two of them were distraught and laid down.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts to build a perimeter, he found a phone number on Bill Hewlett and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobes had a secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it formed my view of what it really is and how it should treat its employees.
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the firm research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desk computer that was ever produced".
He was big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager, I did high and high in the HP, poflaked around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How does innovation come about:
In a few jobs during the interview, he talks about how he invents new products during the course.
At the beginning of his career, when he sold a couple of boards with flat connections, one customer asked him to put the whole computer together for him.
He had only 30 paid days available during which he had to invent, disassembly and add the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he recalls the problems he faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we had quite a fight... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
About forty days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable 15-dollar mouse.
How big a company is breathing:
Long before he led Apple's resurrection, Jobes predicted that many industrial leaders in his vision would collapse and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what's next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so society can no longer be more successful.
At this point, rent and marketing are already in place, so companies are being run by people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are being trained from the decision-making process.
The technological genius, which has led the company to its irrepressible position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she was, she could have been Microsoft's '90s...
But instead of winning, they won the prize.
How does innovation take as an art form:
"There's still a long way and a lot of work between the excellent idea and the excellent product... and as that great idea develops, it's changing and growing."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to join the whole series of compromises - certain things just do not make you make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on taste - you try to think about the best things that humans have ever created, and in a certain way you try to deny them what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to get the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and the best computer experts in the world at the same time.
Without computers and new technologies, wonderful things would prove to be in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opposition to the Health Care Act when their case was handled by the court
On the day that the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question, would it accept an objection to the President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a celebration dinner sponsored by the legal firm that will take part in the trial?
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases under consideration was the appeal brought by 26 states indisputing the radical reprocessing of health care, which was approved by Congress last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
In March, however, a 5.5-hour trial is expected, which will further develop the presidential elections that are planned for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands before the court and will try to achieve the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General for the George W. Bush government.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, has been one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society's group, which has been working for years to defend conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations of law-consuming, the so-called National Federation of Independent Enterprise.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of investing in huge financial resources.
Dinner took place at a Washington hotel several hours after the trial on the subject of the case.
She attended, among other things, also Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate and confirmed support for the Health Care Act.
And hosting?
This is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society for years.
And certainly it's not even about anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct which the lower federal judges are subject to.
However, if not, their conduct would certainly fall under principle C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are directly related and other organisations for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be included in the programme of action."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomase with two legal firms acting in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was rich enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and cowardice towards the code of conduct is contrary to the assertion of several judges that the highest court is acting in accordance with the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Case.
"The judges drank and ate for social benefit together with legal representatives waiting for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in the acquisition of funds through this action undermines the feet of all claims of insecurity, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas were only able to show their criticism of their criticism and showed them that they also combine their judicial duties without problems with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas Ginni's wife is a highly conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the government of President Obama when the first opposition to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan’s criticism pushes her to refrain from taking part in the case, claiming that she was fighting for the law as much as she could now be uninterested.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to resign.
Boeing has received a record order for 18 billion USD
Aerolinks Emirates order 50 two-wheel Boeing 777 power lines with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six flights Boeing Dreamliner to Amman Air, for which it invests more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, most of them have no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50-tons makes a total record of USD 18 billion, it is something else.
The same important report is from where Boeing obtained the order: Middle East, growing gold for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that flights in the Middle East will need $2,520 million over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history about the dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 double-hull Boeing 777.
Sentenced order came from the airlines of Emirates residents in Dubai.
The company Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Air Show announced that airlines have the possibility to buy another 20 aircraft, resulting in a total value of USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that the Oman Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which is proud of much better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six flights exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire company Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines belong to the darker nations with heavy oil.
This means that not only do they have money to pay for aircraft, but they have an increase in fuel prices - most of which are damaging airlines, because it is one of their biggest costs - it is not so crucial because the country itself earns at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders for fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The airline contract Emirates consolidates the leading position of Boeaing on the market with large-scale aircraft and brings to the narrow Airbus SAS that wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominant position with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory will come four months after Airbus’ representatives have announced that they will withdraw their largest A350 aircraft, which is the direct competitor of 777-300ER.
It was due to the customer’s demand for more useful aircraft load and flight, so the manufacturer took time to add more engine power.
Boeing Co's share price grew by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
Mexico's president's sister was defeated, according to all, in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust's Valleyon of PRI, helped drug dealers in the lobby behind the governor's table.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderon, in the violent state elections, lost the governor's office in Michoacán. On Monday, she announced that one of her opponents helped drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results contributed to the leadership in the government elections of the Western state of Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process and especially in yesterday's own elections is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for all of our country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a discussion for radio day after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion research group... they were entertaining the polls, building road strikes... and letting people vote on the PRI order.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when the presidency was lost.
However, planning a rapid return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the election the day before, just very close.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative side of his brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Walleyon as a winner.
The third was set up by Silvano Auerolis, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which has so far ruled the government. For the disbanded and unhappy party, the presidential election in 2012 is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state-owned city of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and offers other candidates for recognition of the results.
Michoacán was long controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It was the birthplace of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán in December 2006 that a military war was waged against dealers.
However, the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, Luisa Marie Calderon's stepfather, was murdered just a week before the elections, and many of the candidates from the elections withdrew from fear.
However, whatever the outcome of the elections in Michoacán looks like for the PRI side, winning the side will help to get a new impulse.
The expected representative of PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Washington Valley and said, "I think this victory might be very encouraging in the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help the eurozone save itself from its serious debt crisis, otherwise a global decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director General of ADB, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European challenges "too unresolved" and said that Asian financial assistance combined with European leadership and resources would help to bring about the long-term deterioration of the global economy.
"We're all in it together."
"So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is in the best position," he said to the Financial Times during a discussion at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Union has been experiencing a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the Italian and Greek governments have retreated.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could be rescinded into recession and called for new emerging leading economies to join and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Institute - would provide the Asian partners with more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what it can," to help the eurozone, because its own economy now suffers from a decrease in exports and the outflow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We face a difficult task and must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a whole fact, because otherwise we could find a job for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as India, have nothing to do with European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, U.S.A., said that it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe for 1.2 billion people in India when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"One day they could find out that the Greeks are going to retirement in their 50s and enjoying vacations on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, likewise questioned why Indian resources should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis threatens to "dangerous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast that in Asia, between 2011 and 2012, 7.5% of economic growth is now facing a "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable developing markets must create "unforeseen spending plans" to protect them from the decline and significant flow of capital from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon regarding possible defence scraps
Minister of Defence Leon Pannett regularly added to the bell on Monday in Congress, warning that tearing automatic cuts in the budget could endanger national security and cause a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing through a battlefield in Afghanistan to civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to continue to reduce the budget by $450 billion over the next ten years, but it is now afraid of a further $600 billion reduction if Congress is unable to conclude an agreement on expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be destructive for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress' inability to reach a budget agreement and hence the so-called build-up would cause 23% of the slowdown and many new projects to be stopped.
"Because of this huge reduction, used in this disproportionate way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy just three quarters of the building or ship. Furthermore, there could be serious damage to other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is so fast, we will also have to send almost certain civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can exacerbate the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Finally, the battle units will be touched, Pannett announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations in the overseas countries will not directly affect this situation, the latter will be adversely affected by major changes in other budgets," Pannetta warned.
"There will also be short-term contractual staff, which will result from the delay in agreed contracts to support the war effort of our people."
"The situation of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and consequent violations of legal and political support."
Both Senator Pannett wrote ten days ago and requested details of the possible effects on automatic shorts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the existence of the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid deterioration of the view of the United States as a world military giant."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Pannett's letter.
"It's not the conclusion that we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen whether Pannett's letter and fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress's approved budget and boost the votes calling for the release of the Pentagon from the list of restricted areas.
Pannetta was as open as possible in recent discussions on possible shorts, even though he himself went to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that he would be released into the thick fight.
At the press conference a minute a week the Minister of Defence pointed out a brief picture of what his resort can wait for - the shell of an army, which will be missing the core.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a munitions-free brigade."
"It'll be like flying without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of separatists, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Pannett said at the beginning of a statement in the Pentagon.
"He will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to reconcile with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
In the Annex to McCain and Graham's Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risk: late response to the crisis, conflict and disaster; significant limitation of the possibilities for landing and landing worldwide; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to end, including those that have already been tested, and those that are just in the early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 aircraft project, which was planned for a new bomber, a new generation of ballistic ponorks, a new coastal combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle, was designed to replace Humvee.
Further development and testing of F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim that it is another necessary step in improving the army that the country needs to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Identify a Lie
The summer view of recent news headlines indicates how serious and readily available lies and deception are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a full handshake for accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
The administrators at Penn State University were accused of guilty testimony when they tried to hide the records that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested, as US President Barrac Obama told the US microphone that the Israeli President of the Benjamin Netanyahu government was a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy all careers and secure the stability of many countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he published information that was immediately erased by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of misappropriating funding from his campaign to try to hide his non-marriage relationship.
And no one will ever forget about the media circus that shot around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski.
It's just stories of cheating at school and at the university all over the place.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers only to make them look good in their own exams.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we meet?
Studies show that you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases in one day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, foreign people lied three times.
The identification of lies, or "the recognition of lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should gain for personal or work.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharad, when a person says, "I have you." The identification of the lie is a serious sector of science working with scientific data gathered during the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about lies have been lost.
Liars look in your eyes.
It's not like they'd stick around, cook, red or shave.
But don't get out of it because it's kind of hard to see and discover lies.
A trained liar identifier can reveal the truth from a substantial building, a small expression in the face, a way of creating questions and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a vast and developing lying recognition sector and it is clear that the discovery of fraud is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can help you very much in today’s difficult world - especially if your work obligations include hiring, arranging interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them pour themselves into caution, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men invent more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "to others" - mostly because to protect some feelings - women lie less often to their partners than free people (although the lies that they say are mostly "unfortunate").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behaviour of the subject.
It's called "beginning observation."
He'll be able to find out later what to compare with.
Note the holding of the body of the subject, his smile, his work with the voice.
You should know if someone is always sticking his legs so you don't falsely accuse him of lying just because he's starting to stick his legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the sequences of false verbal and unverbal behavior.
However, you only take it as warning signals, not as evidence of a lie.
People who lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their thought story, the tips of the shoe can turn to the door, move to the east, change significantly the body's holding or reveal the "left after the conversation" - overcrowded breath and change position when there is a difficult response to them.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that the interview is at the end, just to see what the ulva will look like after its completion.
You can also imagine the subject's language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once crossed and used the last time he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which went through the state-in-the-art search for her body.
Slandering entities can also say in moderation: "I had no sexual relationship with this Mrs. Levinski" or the difficult question is repeated.
The most common verbs are just very subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "smoothing language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... let me tell you the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such a response, we do not know too much of the facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic that could reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills by which lies can be traced.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance of finding a liar and a cheater in his personal and work.
Controversial plan for the construction of an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the American Government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which has dishonored the committees, but has calmed environmentalists - the company with the pipeline has announced that it is willing to redirect the project to make things move again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it moved the planned route through the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will be approved.
This decision was notified by the company at a press conference in the home of the government.
The TransCanada pillar Alex Purbax claims that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipe will eventually be approved, although it will lead to another route.
This notice came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared last week that it was deferring a decision on the Federal Project Authorisation, from which it would not conduct studies of possible substitute routes which could not be affected in the Sandhills area in Nebraska and in the watery Ogalla, a vast underground reservoir of water.
"This is really moving forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological assessment commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have withdrawn any decision until 2013, i.e. one year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play a political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the foreign ministry and expressed his support.
1 700 miles of long tube will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil will protect them daily.
This way will have to be six states.
This project is completely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by workers who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the legislators in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would make the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and Ogalla, the main source of drinking water and moisture.
The current study on the environmental impact, commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry said that the general inspector of the ministry ordered a new review of the whole process of the original study and focused mainly on two issues.
On one occasion, the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008 did not present in the conflict of interest program.
Next, whether the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of turning her fears away from the battalion.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle just rushed into the west of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter so that the fear of it came back.
The "Lady Marmalade" voiced fear of 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorder" and "an increased fear of strangers," her family claims in a complaint filed with the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Last November 10, Kevin Monk, his wife Rosanna, a school teacher, and Genevieve were about to take a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Rosana Monkova sat down in the lobby of their house in the riverside Boulevard and carried along Genevieve.
Rosanna Monková said she stopped at the door for a while and waited for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up."
LaBelle was a pregnant woman who had a heart attack.
"The aggressive tone said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter in the door," said Rosana Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking in a simple way, and she cried out in a loud voice the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water with her and she started waiting for me.
They say Genevieve got hysterical arrest.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle to the mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - threw and had to stop her until her escort, which then dragged her into the waiting car, said Rosanad Monková.
In the meantime, the daughter cried so much when she returned, added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but they had no answers.
Lawyer and singer LaBelle don't respond to our phone calls to speak to the whole cause.
The complaint calls for closer unexplained damages, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken away free of charge and that the family plans to spend all the money spent on charitable organizations dedicated to children with cancer.
"The aim is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an 18-month-old."
The climate crisis has made the economy miserable.
During the first year of the government Maria López Valdez grew unemployment and uncertainty in Sinaloa, decreased foreign investment and with them the economy
The year 2011 is recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which itself calls the government of change. This government has brought with it a great expectation of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have been reduced.
Low February temperatures have led to millions of losses in agriculture, limited the possibility of growth in the state economy, and have an awareness of the decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year.
According to the report of the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded at 582,835 hectares of treated soil, 78.03% of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partial damage. Among the main destroyed fruits are vegetables, corn and games.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state until November. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, unemployment rates in the state have increased during the first three quarters of the year. Between January and March 55,053 people in Sinaloa have not been employed, representing the unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment has risen to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment continued to grow and reached 6.19%, representing approximately 74 000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly on the basis of the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of increasing unemployment associated with various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to the restriction of resources due to legislation approved by the Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally use dollars, it is not easy to make them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes indicated that there is also a demographic factor to increase unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, in the United States, has decreased, however, for reasons of inconvenient entry, and also because even though these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to find work. People are therefore staying and demanding work from our state, and so unemployment is growing," he said.
Untrusted
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening due to the increasing uncertainty that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employed people in the state work without deducting the social security administration.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and uncertainty. In this administrative area, there are the lowest wages from all over the country, as reported by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesos by September, deep below the national average, which is moving at 7,375 pesos.
Abbreviation of direct foreign investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and growth in unemployment, the most significant decrease in direct foreign investment over the last 10 years has been recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment of $630,697 was achieved from January to June, representing a decrease of 87.74% against $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State has invested 17 280 million pesos a year.
Dlüh
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the government requested the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with a view to revitalizing the economy. Local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria López Valdèse, pointed out the government’s lack of control.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chambers of the transformation industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of harmony between the individual sectors, including the state's own governments.
"The evolution of the economy in Sinaloa has been really inconceivable during this year. We must work hard to get back the land that we lost this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, lack of harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully, the next year will be much better," he said.
Low-cost
Loredo López said that events like frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was slowing down the economy, which was not quickly enough to be able to regain momentum, which would allow an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. That is why at the end of the year we felt deeply under expected forecasts," he said.
Redefinition of consignment
According to Theodore Salazara Uriarte, President of the Employer’s Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we note that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan is needed to redefine the objectives and economic direction of the state, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future, which would better govern the efforts of the government.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He pointed out that the current administration had made progress with regard to public policy management.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is trying to be favorable. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg marijuana
The inhabitants of Navolato were sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of suffering for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a criminal offence of endangering health, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army components on 7 June 2010 during a march in the street of Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in the district of El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer went in the pick up white delivery. In the car in the shelf he had a black bag and on the seat of the co-pilot a small bag. The soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man has remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Chamber and the case remains internal within the framework of the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Effects of Crime.
Appropriations due to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be involved in the end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development has stated that, so far construction work has gone ahead, it is now threatening that the government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require more than 11 million pounds per three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. To date, only the Federation and the city have added funds to the work, so it is possible that projects are delayed.
"They're supposed to secure nearly 12 million, and although the year is about to end, we've got nothing at all, and even though we were supposed to get a piece in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started projects and continue very well, but we lack money."
He stated that last year, for the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million non-state administrations.
"The constant thing has already become for us in the previous sixties, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get the funds that would cover what was not finished," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment by the State representatives regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that the request was sent to Armand Villareal, the secretary of administration and finance to speed up the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't got a weight."
The Court approves the "end of analogous transmission" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional appeal brought by the Senate and the Ambassador against the presidential decree, which wanted to speed up the so-called "disaster of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his authority when he issued a decree stating individual steps that would lead to the transition to digital television.
As a result, the appeal brought by the Senate was rejected, because a qualified majority of eight votes were not reached so that the Court could express its determination or inconsistency of the said decree, which remains valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olgo Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring a decree unconstitutional because the regulation of all radio and television issues is a matter which is, under the law, the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel), thus violating the principles of hierarchy and exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Separatist film industry supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the appeal brought by the Ambassador without entering into the discussion on the proposal, which also concerns Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the President-in-Office stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive could not structure by means of general standards measures to prepare public administration.
"I do not think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is owned by the federal executive who has a constitutional mandate to direct the state.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. It relates to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is believed that to remove the change would mean to remove the use of digitalisation, which requires a decision on the matter of public interest. Digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "is also concerned with economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences which the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a whole number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they have been made available by highly specialized technical authorities.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to bring an inconsistency decree to a certain extent involving the power of the Congress to bring it into the administrative area of compliance with laws prepared by legislation.
In Michoacán analyzes the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and the second seats in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent. So far 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "voice by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, according to data published by the Pre-election Results Programme (PREP), there is a difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections of not more than 27 per cent, and this has not yet been counted 879 of the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llandral Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a whole series of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before it was due to expire the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral period and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel mentioned their publication within a specified time limit in the Official Journal Act, with any objections to them.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the head of state in the case of constitutional reform as "inappropriate and illegal", because it has no right to approve or veto".
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice by vote" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that the adoption of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council will allow partial and total counting to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be carried out under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the field concerned or has no President at its disposal; or if there are errors and obvious violations of the electoral results.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all polls will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an express request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition which nominated the candidate in the second place appears at the beginning of the meeting.
The total recalculation of votes will also be possible if, after proper counting, it becomes clear that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an express request by the political party whose candidate has ended in the second place. In this case, the electoral packages in which partial counting has been made will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP there is a difference between the first and the second places of not-ending 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Fire Mountain, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday the ceremony and the atmosphere will take place.
According to the family, it was the Colonel's last wish that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of the Fire.
After having received the highest honors in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuil on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. The family and the closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
On the afternoon of the Colonel's ashes, he arrived in a chapel in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where his family and friends also came.
At 5:30 a.m., there was a dismissal at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, which was organized by his former associates from the technology school and members of the American football team, who was also a member of Felipe Bacio at the time of the graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be sprinkled on the Incinerated Mountain. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "it was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and went to college in Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, yet he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "the husband came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died when he was the best person in his life: flying.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Deputy Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we were relieved of all the misgivings that the governor of Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the six military zones, the Mexican Air Force itself, leading representatives and students of the University of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985, and where he came out in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter that drove. He was also on board the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the officials of this state.
In 18:05, the remains of the Saltilen relative Bacio Cortés (burned) came to be handed over through funeral services to the Mexican air force led by Major Jaime Martinez to the space where his family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on Cadereyta NL
Several hours before the military investigation, the representatives represented 11 persons detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and heads were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was found at 1.5 kilometers from Cadreyt road to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
The people who moved in these places noticed that the chateau with the coffee bar had time since the door opened.
When they looked inside, about three meters away, they noticed the corpse of three people, so they immediately warned the competent authorities.
One person wore a yellow sports shirt and a dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was a man lying also in a sports shirt with white stripes.
About a few meters later, there were other people dressed in red sports dress and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying face to face.
According to the data obtained on the site, all three persons were likely killed elsewhere because no matches were found.
There were messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other and also a number of feet behind the bullets, both on the building and on the door.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained
The National Defence Secretariat presented 11 persons, including young people, who were members of the criminal group, who operated in particular in the area of Cadereyta and who were associated with kidnappings, murders, prosecution and unlawful burial.
According to the information published at the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one detainee was released.

Another attack occurred on 12 November at 6 o'clock. Military personnel were on the run in Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyt when he noticed a car without a SPZ and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they took a look and discovered one gun, a cartridge, and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, about 14 a.m. on November 13th, one of the complicit in the area of La Frauda was detained.
They were accused of illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The President-in-Office of the Government of Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to present him with a new government that will face the crisis that this country is holding over the collapse of the economic disaster.
The President-in-Office of the Government of Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that keeps this country from the economic disaster and which has put the euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorg Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can create a government.
They are expected to represent the government with a complex majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in an attempt to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to create a government, but then his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in just three days, which is much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, which has resulted in the debt being wasted at an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must adopt a strong package of economic measures that require European leaders. Only this will restore Italy's well-established credibility.
In Monti, there is a great pressure to accelerate. Due to the instability of the markets, they have exceeded the interest on Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year limit of 7 percent, the level where Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Employers' Organisation of Confiindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Montim: "We have said that we are very supportive of this government".
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this delicate situation.
Monti’s hopes for success varied significantly thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconho, whose crisis led to the resignation on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended for good results," Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the media, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because so far a number of its members have turned against the government with the technical majority of Monti.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament in order to promote non-popular economic reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has added to the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started a discussion Monday with political parties, committees and business groups, youth organisations and women.
The round will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed president of Napolitan on Sunday, which enabled a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a short decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi was giving up the demise, the interest in Italian bonds had returned to the critical border and were reacting to uncertainty as to whether the new president of the government was making a success.
To save Italy whose public debt is moving to EUR 1.8 billion would be beyond the possibilities of the current reserve of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the general projections that say politicians are giving him time only to carry out reforms and then declare early elections.
Monti said he would like to join politics in his office, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to get Italy out of the difficulties that the country has received because of financial pressure.
Political sources have indicated that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate attempts to join the government and political personality.
Spanish participants in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten go beyond the 50th limit of international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 slowed players scored 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the San José National Stadium.
While world and Europe champions, the number one FIFA monthly rating, have on their account a wide range of Class A inter-election matches, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman's defender, who as the only player played 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday at Rommel Fernández Stadium in the fight against Panama (0-2).
Spanish footballers, who play in the Battle of the Stars and in powerful English first league clubs, have been holding intensive activity on league championships and domestic Cups and high-level Cups in European Cups like Champions League.
In the past, we also need to add experience from the Spanish national team in the complex competitions for European and world championships.
On the contrary, Costa Rican players have very limited options for foreign competitions in the field. For example, Concacaf is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign competitions from Spanish representations has on its own by Iker Casillas, who arrived last Saturday in front of England (game 0-1 in London) on the former Andoni Zubizarreta player with 126 international matches.
Casillas will come against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of matches on their account. Among them the mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
There's a hundred of them approaching Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
Following Xabi Alonso from 91; Fernando Torres from 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos from 81; Andrés Inista from 62; Cesc Fábregas from 61; and David Silva from 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Uman are moving the left wing of Junior Díaz with 48 matches and Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 crossed the 30-game line: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The minimum number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbelo (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches is Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest hasn't even exceeded 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best Spanish shooter is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour at the occasion of the 20th anniversary
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In the exclusive interview for Viva, base Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next week.
We waited for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That's what the baseman and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the course of the tour on the occasion of a 20-year anniversary and on Sunday 20 will be at a unique stop in Central America.
This day will take place from 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the English band The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview that you will find all the reviews on La Nacion's website on the Internet.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans enjoy?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America we have hardly had a second and present experience.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country and I believe we can live here for a few days.
So we're very glad we can bring you our music.
I wonder, because here the group of words adores, fans are experiencing these days very intensively.
What do you say to your rockers?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is that causing more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the past 21 years have been on the horizon for several weeks.
We've had some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope it's what we're getting into for a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love serving it, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rican and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfers' friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going to surf Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, and these are the best places to surf, and so we've learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we've never played here, we have no limits on what we can't do.
We will try to play the best show with various songs. We will try to play some songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You're never repackaging a repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we might have forgotten about it.
So it's more interesting for us to show, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art trails.
When you look back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in a big rock group and that we'd stay in it for over 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and we feel that we can still play together.
We like to make music.
We're lucky we can look at places we've always been looking for.
We couldn't get better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the genus grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which they are represented by themselves.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a move comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common to have five to ten groups from one city to another.
We're proud of it and we're honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some more.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that came into effect in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and have still the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a long time longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think that first we're all lucky that we're still in this world and secondly, it's the fact that we're still interested in each other.
We are all close friends, and this has helped us to open up the music paths that leave every person with sufficient freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we respect each other's music, and I think it might not be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was gradually easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too far because it is very easy to fall into this trap of dwarves and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, you will remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it. You must not let yourself be consumed by being famous, rock stars.
How do you remember another Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something big.
As a band, we were three years old and never released any albums until Andrew Woods died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy as incredible as I was with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, enjoy music or football and many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Chapel will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as advance?
Yes, production sent us videos with a few suggestions and this group liked us the most. That's why we're curious what Las Robertas offers to live and must be very fun.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's words alive?
That's Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He's singing it and I think he's adding the first thing he's gonna do.
Who affects you as a base?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about the basics that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt a slight separation from the grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. And even if this music is still valid today, it is something great because it is music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At first, your music was slightly cloudy and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel that in the new album there are a few compositions that are easier to write, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
In both of them, when Ed played it for me, I cried, and it's really dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs just represent this to me.
I also think you can be a happy man and still do cloudy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he was to be tested for muscle loss, which he suffered in the area of lower limbs, informed his medical doctor.
The 72 - year - old Fujimori, who was sentenced to 25 years ’ imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancers of the tongue, which has been operated four times and are currently under control.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should know why he was suffering and why he was losing his strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want it because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of the cancer of his tongue, weighed 18 kg and added to these problems other disorders such as severe erosion of gastritis, spleen cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and running problems in his legs, the doctor appointed him.
Fujimori has been punishing itself since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, 25 years of imprisonment for the death of 25 persons killed by the murder squad of an army illegally operating in the first years of his government.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, starts a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between both nations and to address the political issues of the region.
Mujica is meeting with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. This is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting with politicians, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program has been published by the Uruguayan President's Office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between both countries," the Uruguayan Presidential Office published on its websites.
According to local media, Mujica will try to hire Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy arranged a list of tax havens for the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community.
Mexico is president of the G20 since November. G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. With that Latin American country, it has concluded an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation since January this year.
The Uruguayan Government has in recent years sought to concrete the tax exchange agreement with a view to obtaining from the "black paper" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) where countries have not introduced all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has strengthened trade between the two countries.
Vosate installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil spells, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of girls with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month into all shops around the world, has been created from the beginning to use all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how stereos are supposed to work without glasses," said a press officer specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game Nintendo created specifically for this carrier", because until now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations already existing titles.
Speaking Nintendo said that in addition to the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and gas game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less convenient users.
Once you have crossed this level, you can get into the "second wheel" on the level games that are more demanding this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or something that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome the most diverse challenges and "do not succumb to optical flaws".
This new Super Maria 3D performance also assumes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not been reached since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into the notes to those who watch the saw and repeat a successful formula from previous works. It rests in the fact that the installer of the vested man will have to go through dangerous abandoned platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in motion, in the environment, in dresses and also among enemies, Luigi will also appear "playy".
Colom approved the issue of Portilla to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to issue former President Alfonse Portilla, who is to be responsible in the United States for the collection of 70 million US dollars.
This ends the process aimed at having Guatemala respond to the request of a northern country that requires the release of Portilla to be able to judge it.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and executive powers and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He ensured that during his term of office, he "did not interfere" with court decisions and allowed all the publications that he had obtained on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious health damage and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move means a step towards execution after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted in order to bring proceedings against the former President who ruled in the years 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and will be guaranteed respect for human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the discovery of 120 million at the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency.
Trinije helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization has created to help children without education to avoid feeling at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinije social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened by social exclusion have been helped.
There are hundreds of jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a balance sheet within the framework of a solemn act, which took place in the former Fabra and Coats factory's production premises and which involved more than 300 people.
Trinije's organization was established in the Triniat Vella quarter in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work facing drug dependence or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andrew was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The varied political representation, during the elections, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by the Trinity.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education advisor Ernest Maragall, and former mayor and current ecological and socialist councillor Richard Goma, participated in the ceremony.
In the big hall Fabra and Coats were also provided by the current Social Welfare and Family Council, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanspa.
Mas said that Trinijo was born in a very difficult time and that today's time also has a number of obstacles, but he added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The President cited Trinijo as an example of how to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There was a ban on the house where giant parties were held
Firefighters own 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday afternoon without putting resistance
It all shows that the nightmare experienced by neighbors of number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday to leave the building that they were illegally living in and where they had organized giant parties that were the neighbors. They left the building from the court regulation without having to involve the police.
After the operation was completed, a lock was exchanged at the door to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be monitored," said the manager.
The occupants who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the remaining ones are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water facilities, and also painted the walls and left behind all kinds of waste, especially bottles after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties, which lasted up to two days and caused other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to the European Press that after the construction was occupied, the markets had dropped by 80%.
The discotheque owner emphasises that the owners of the building had made it uncompetitive, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, where the discotheque is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbors’ charges for noise. However, problems did not affect the visitors of the discotheque, but the residents of the home and especially those who attended the scheduled parties, whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks have grown, depending on the distraught inhabitants of the environment.
The discotheque owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and would forgive her for nine months.
The City Police have also confirmed that over the last few weeks, they have received more complaints from their neighbors about the situation.
The president of the city group of the People's Party of PP at the council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately moved and ended with the problems of civil coexistence suffered by the neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The President of the Peoples explained that only one step was forbidden before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers have reached all the patrons of the building and almost all the apartments and even in one of them has been stolen.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent when it comes to the effects on the civil liability that occurred in the building".
Yesterday the city police also cleaned the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., the police arrived at a building 35 on Mont-ral Street after the neighbors who saw four people come into the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of the publication of proceedings involving more than a dispute over honours
The city selection procedure on 16 gates reopens the debate on the role of Collserol Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the biggest bloom, the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) has already disappeared, this self-government has printed several pamphlets to support the Callserola Park.
The plane defined the mountain as a large metro park in Barcelona.
More than that, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on either north - south, but up (top) - down (sea).
Collseroly's qualification as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with savages instead of Yogi bears.
This was the position until September, when the councilman announced the mega competition with 16 competitions for the same number of entry gates to Collseroly.
The gate, of course, captures the idea of the park.
It's either this or someone's trying to put the door on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and based on a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already as sharp as the two members of this old caste elected to meet in the lift hand.
And that's exactly what this is about, one of the rare similarities between what the three Barcelona architects think and the leading university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection procedure has its own responsibilities.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss also the "mountain side", so the Ildefonse Cerda's statement on green apples was not involved in the end.
"We must come from the principle that the longest Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, it's very accessible.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "doors to Collserola" is "lexical paste": we cannot imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a definition of areas where action can be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayon, with experience from the urban world, qualifies as an "intellectual challenge" with a "some danger".
The danger arising from the "nobility which today represents the project of a public place" after the experience of the 80s, which had in the area of the Forum's "song labyrinth".
The first fear is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something means to take another step already," it is in principle to move on.
"It is important to remember the new urbanist and planning tools, because the current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)) can cause a real collapse."
If we focus more on the question, Modol thinks that the lower slope of Collserol can be "considered as a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "can't end in the trash", even though he welcomes the fact that the councillor offers his jury that he will hit the project from "first moment".
In addition, it understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is like a failure that allows architects to engage in debate, but "questions" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", it adds), which should be created: "Architecs should only be tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that called this game is complex, because in the foundations for the selection process there is a lack of the global vision of Collserol: "There have been 16 selection procedures that deal with all eight mountains - the sea, but there are no remote studies that would be viewed and understood in the area as a whole."
That's why at least he applied to all 16 election procedures.
Otherwise, the design of one gate may affect the concept and definition of the neighboring gate architect.
In his view, the consultant should ensure that the zone immediately above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire area of equipment that would ensure a gas transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed by Jonási Larrazábal, which will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal officer of Cadino Red granted his brother the grace of Mayor Monterrey in the process in which he was sued for alleged expulsion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison, and now he will be released after the legal officer Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the area in which he was discussing the case of an exaggeration in which the brother of mayor Monterrey was accused.
After the assassination of Casino Royale owner Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás had to apply for an economic quota to enable the workers in Monterrey to operate illegally in the betting house.
After the public prosecution, the Public Prosecutor's Office initiated the criminal prosecution of a brother of the Panist Age. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours spent in front of the Public Service Agent, number 3 for property crimes was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
The following 49 days after the second regulation was adopted for the arrest and the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had lost the opportunity to participate or to commit an organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta to suspect that the owners of the Casino Red had been stabbed by one and a half million pesos. However, only a few hours remained in prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city halls of San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that, almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence was gathered to prove Jonah's guilt. Among the evidence is the payment of 1.5 million pounds to casino representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation will be enabled.
This Monday the legal officer of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo Garcia Gómez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal proceedings with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether the damage had been corrected and which of the partners decided to grant mercy. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain hidden.
On the basis of official record 197/2011, the legal mercy of Jonas Larrazábal shall be granted. No complaint shall be made against him in the proceedings against him. It shall not be possible to claim damages or punishment.
After remanding with the legal officer about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The judge’s secretary, Jorge Yanez, went to the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and that his case had been postponed to the archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate release order.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the air traffic accident, where the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation of the incident, in which the secretary of the government of Francisco Blake Mora and seven others showed that the helicopter had hit directly on the ground with full force, without the pilot having a chance to try forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the launch of the plane, the pilot found that the weather conditions allowed for years.
"Parts that appear suggest that the unit came into contact with the site several times, the wings were intertwined into the tree branches 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all the requirements for the carriage of staff.
In addition, he stated that no parts were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the area of assault.
"In the search it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft was hit on the ground as a solid.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 persons, meeting all the requirements for the carriage of persons.
The terrain shows a slope of between seven and thirty degrees.
The Secretary has ensured that at the moment it is most important to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, announced that at the time of the attack, the helicopter of the President-General's headquarters was moving at a travel speed and an accident occurred on the soft steep terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that during the accident it was a regular overflight operation," he said.
At the press conference, SCT Pérez Jácome appointed six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate the appropriate conditions at the start, according to which the aircraft is heading towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico the visible layers were cloudy at low altitudes.
Selected paths:
It is likely that the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility until the Cuernavac Valley.
The location of the attack.
The attack coordinates and the last record of the helicopter from the radar agree, it is likely that there was no loss of control before the attack, nor was there any disruption of the flight's trajectory.
Exploitation of aircraft residues in a restricted area:
The information we have currently available allows us to assume that there has been an attack on the same trajectory and on the other hand.
The design of the aircraft’s remains indicates that at the time of the attack on the ground, the helicopter was stationary.
There was no fire or explosion.
Unfortunately, there was no evidence that there was an explosion or a fire at the site.
The last results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several solid contacts.
During field work, the remains of the aircraft were found up to 9200 feet above the sea, the terrain is tied up, and the altitude goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show pictures where there was likely to be a breakdown along that route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have reached contact with the country in several places.
After close observation in the vicinity of the accident, no remnants of the helicopter were found in the area that was larger than the area of the excavation, which reinforces the belief that the collision occurred when the helicopter was still achievable.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has initiated a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research to discover the gene responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to reveal a gene that causes obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will be able to obtain results regarding overweight.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Unit from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers was set up.
This team supports specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the National Institute of Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) from the National Institute of Polytechnics (IPN).
The research can also be joined by a wide public with or without authorization. People can join IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where every congregation will conduct tests for 8 hours as a youth.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Centre (East Mexico State).
Once data are obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (south from the Federal District) and finally at the Sports Centre Morelos (north from the Federal Centre).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and young people and thus prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to gather data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He explained that anthropometric measurements (weight, height, circumference), blood pressure are measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined every Saturday and genes are examined (it is sought to identify genes that share child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research reflects the concerns of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
'The health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was only 77% in boys to increase obesity and 47% in girls.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is that the country's population differs from other populations from its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African.
He explained that the general genetics of obesity is usually explained as an inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calorie) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will receive a comprehensive assessment of the state of the children, which will determine whether they have any known overweight or obesity.
He noted that even the presence of acantosis on the neck and the forehead suggests that the individual is likely to suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
The information is still confidential, the doctors hand it over to their parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make in order to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedative way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, a full-time session before television and the use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
It also causes a large calorie intake, which is greater consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.
There will be no excuses in Asphalt with UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature
If it was properly cared for, it would not be necessary to correct nearly 200 thousand rains after each rainy period in the Valle de México metropolitan area, Rafael Herrero Nájera, a scientist at the University of Chemicals (FQ) from UNAM, who at the same time added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt rains were adequate, a significant limitation of rains would occur, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Excessives, which he spoke of during the International Year of Chemistry, announced that a laboratory under his guidance develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera is of the opinion that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of the oil, is the collection of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with large molecular weights called asphaltenes, and other with low molecular weights called maltens. Together they supply asphalt with a typical viscolastic character.
The viscoalastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost stable, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to laminate, added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the expert on chemical engineering noted.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemicals observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered by a flexible painting, consisting of six types of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt cartridge, made of small stones in the asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms a stick is asphalt.
When driving a car or creating a pressure, it is possible that the forces in the plate are well spread.
If it was modified asphalt, it would be even better spread, it is considered a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt stick is placed the last layer called the coat, made of fine stone, which is also the sand of the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with vehicle tyres, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt sticker and must ensure the training of the vehicle.
Given that as part of the alloying will be exposed to heavy loads, the coat must have sufficient thickness and attention must be paid to the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that you need to remember. In particular, water has a great influence on the function of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the area is wet, the water spreads inside and it is difficult to get out, it causes all kinds of skin to soften and thus the formation of a mucous membrane.
He explained that during the creation of the candles, as the first dirty film of the coat and until then there is damage to the asphalt sticker. However, damage does not occur at one time, but it is an optional process that should be stopped at the first marks using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the production of candles, and therefore the thickness of each layer of the plate must correspond to the weight of the vehicles and must ensure that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that, as far as as asphalt is concerned, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. For example, there are asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries and which allow us to easily correct the situation without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle to become a new Miss Columbia?
The analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to obtain Miss Columbia's crown.
Valle gets the first multiple of the 14th.
Valle del Cauca failed to reach Miss Columbia's crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna must have been satisfied that she felt at the top of the winners, got a silver crown and a scarf, based on which she became the new first multimissis of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and starred Miss Atlántico, the said department won the first multimission title. Melina thus joined the representatives of women from Valle del Cauca, who reached the winning crown, but finally were declared the first multimission. Among them were Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellina Ayala (1979), Lorraine Álvarez (1981), Rosa Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Giraldo (2000).
The question many are asking.
The result is the defeat of a great favorite that has shown in all previous wheels that it is to become a new Miss Columbia, not for free the Royal Police and the most beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to appoint her was the First Multimission, is that she did not prove her answer to the question: "Which book did you like most and why?", which Martin Murillo Gómez from the literary edition of Leamos.
The candidate replied to the question:
"Read a lot. I very believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in childhood was "Small Prince", a very deep book.
It's a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know, and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors, called "El Ardor de la sangre".
However, this response did not like the term "culturalize" and the second because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
After the ceremony Melina said she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what is going to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can.
One of the other assumptions is that Valle destroyed her favorite position.
The Bogotá journalist pointed out that from the beginning the candidate was the most popular, the most unpopular, and the one who took all the previous prices (the Gastronomic Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), aroused the envy of other guests, shaken the queen, who then set the stage.
It was visible during the first presentation of boats on the Hilton beach and during two screenings prior to the final coronation.
Even though she was shining on both of them, she was known to lack the strength and power that the Magdalena and Atlantic representatives had.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at Canal RCN, believes that Melinda has won the title of the first multimission confirms the fact that a candidate who gets the most titles during the competition does not finally leave with the queen's crown".
In addition, Valle has been more abusive to the media in recent days and it has not been paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just two days before the election, an international member of the Lucy Doughty jury said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the competition Miss Columbia's beauty is not enough for herself, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that candidates were involved in such projects before they entered the competition," she explained.
It is also speculative that Valle's candidate lost points because of her lack of background and fibrosis, which was visible on her ass. However, this is quite contrary to the verdict of the jury that chose her to miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on her ass, which in my opinion was not too familiar, were wearing points until the last day".
In the meantime, a journalist named Guido Hoyos from the magazine Cromos believes that a relative from Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are okay, but they didn't make it in the Vale.
The body was never her strong page and here she chose her tax."
For the reason of this appreciation, which was first given by the National Beauty Assembly, after a survey of the sailors, there was a harsh prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymondo Melina wished not to finally have to give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has begun her year of rule today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that allows her to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the success of Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the inhabitants of Cali, who identified Alfonse Cana's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfons Cana.
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4th last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana", through comparison of fingerprints.
From seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department this week, there were men from Puerto Tejad who worked for 21 years in the field of judicial research.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a workshop in Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days washing his hands to get to a place where dead people were needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle and after he graduated from the appropriate courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science is involved in the study of skin screening, which is hand and foot.
During the week of the operation against that Alfonsi Can, Eliezer was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
There was something big expected.
He went to Cauca on Friday night in a helicopter from Palmir.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead bodies and that he suspected that one of them was a man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so they asked her to take a card with Guillerm Leon Sáenze's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team to the place where she was dead, he did not recognize her for physical reasons.
He didn't have weights, he was dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much more quiet.
But the prints don't.
Along with Galton's lupus, ink and transplanter and light, Eliezer began comparing the fingerprints of the dead with the records from the card.
Her eye didn't fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
That very night, a man from Puerto Tejad was commissioned to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzon that he was really the Supreme Commander of Farc.
Search for a stop
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eleazar González at the press conference of operational services against "Cano" is very important.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Daktyloscopy is accurate science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in deciding crime.
In addition to the identification of the dead, these people help to investigate criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured.
When caught, many delicents present false documents or do not have any papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The investigator reported that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of wall at home because at this place he was more reluctant to extract a treasure full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to collect prints, but in this case we could get a full hand print and identify the offender who participated in several thefts," he reminded.
Fingerprints may also confirm or reverse suspicion of murder.
They recently found a dead man with a bottle of alcohol around him.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and that the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it is not possible to state in a step by step that he was a real killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on fingerprints from CTI explained that the prints "have been screened using chemical or physical reactive substances" from the articles.
When it appears, a transplanter or belt shall be used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a delinquent database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians, whose data are nowhere to be found," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like everything you're shaking, it's not gold, it's not everything you touch.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Refugees" protest in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were pushed to the Zuccitta Square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them waited for an order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the movement Obsess Wall Street challenged the representative of New York on Tuesday, when they tried by court order to get back to Manhattan, where they were expelled in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators were pressuring the Zuccitti square, where they wanted to get to the court order that allowed the "scarlet" to return to their seats. The second part of the movement responded to the cleaning by taking the park to the north of the city where further detentions occurred.
"If the court won't let us go back to the square, we'll sit somewhere else and continue in the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccitti, and that's through the assembly, so peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers of the "Course Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the "enraged" response to the removal of the camp, which he himself ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached a trial where Judge Lucy Billings issued a command that prohibited violent expulsion of the camp and allowed protesters to remain here.
In addition to the "burning" they also took another park located on the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the ferry land in the Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and held up some protesters.
The organization ensures that hundreds of people have been seated on the site, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to express their support and try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccitti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to be held on Tuesday and during which the law of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced demonstrators even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the audiences who were watching the scene, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some policemen were demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from moving members of the movement "Ocupa Wall Street" or from using "laws which were published after the beginning of the strike, or from prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg stated for the press that, given this court order, the city has stopped the reopening of public space and the protesters have warned that local laws do not allow them to return to their states and packages.
The highest representative of the city personally defended the early displacement of Zuccotti, an operation in which 200 people were detained and acceded to, because the protesters "disobedient to the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the premises because there was "a place where people didn't go protesting, but violate laws and in some cases harm others" because "some shops received dangerous letters" and "neighbors were afraid of the quality of their lives".
"The early cleansing was alarming and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interest on behalf of the American working people," he added a speaker who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The representatives of the movement "Ocupa Wall Street" also stated that they plan to organize "great actions" on Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organisations to remind them of two months after the protests took place.
Pamela Anderson will introduce Miss Marie in a special Christmas TV show
With Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, it will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at Home Improvement, the swimmer at Baywatch, the playboy, the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be Miss Mary in a special Canadian TV Christmas series.
The private TV station CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the singing of sentimental songs by Michael Bublé and other significant Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will be enchanting Miss Mary.
CTV today showed pictures of a television program in which Anderson, also known as Internet home porn videos, appeared with his ex-husband, "Mötley Crue", Tommy Leem, as Miss Maria holding in the sand doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on stage Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian comedian who recently acted as a moderator on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peterse are featured in the special Christmas TV broadcast by Canadian singer Bublé, who was married in late March in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisan Lopilato, who is close to the controversy.
Recently, Bubble called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York City a "man".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to household consumption and thus ends the period of falls that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government accounted for material losses of $300 000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is well under way.
After three quarters of the fall, the value of HDP between July and September was reached in such a position that it was possible to turn the page with a definitive validity: HDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan tax year starts in March 2012 - also assume the highest rate of growth compared to the period from January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Companies have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending is falling by 0.9% over the period from January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy stems exclusively from the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it or to rebuild the infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.

Flows were committed to the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors fleeing the debt crisis from the eurozone and the worrying forecasts of the United States. It is a privilege, however, which is at the same time a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is destined for the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony started their weak results in July until September just the yen course.
While markets remain bordering EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is discreet.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts instability in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tens to 100.4 points versus 100.8 in August.
The euro area even reached an average of 100. It reached 99.13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says the savings measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky border guarantees and the uncertainty that has again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "agreement" of the new transitional Greek governments is given to Brussels rather than to the real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, admitted that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment would probably be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new measures would in no way support and reiterated his requirement to issue new elections on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's message does not explain any doubt about his position: "We have committed ourselves to the help of the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The President of the Conservatives went to the EU and the IMF a bit far away. These organisations are supposed to unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needed. At the same time, he stated that he did not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of the savings measures.
The European Commission, which has already seen the impact that Papandreou has had on the referendum, yesterday stressed that its requirements are inexhaustible: it does not unlock any aid unless the new governments and representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Speaker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika will return to Athens "very soon" and will deal with the new government on "what needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek pregnant has a moment to get out of.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen lifts Spain’s position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance".
The Queen of Sofia yesterday recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this tool of cooperation, whose essence lies in "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind.
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Microloans Summit in Valladolid, convinced that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation is "very necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals that are to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, i.e. the amount that determines the threshold of poverty".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsible", stressed the Queen of Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are intended primarily for these loans.
"We've already reached a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The Microloans Summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the aim was to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to obtain 100 million families above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after "what was issued on this journey by the thinker Muhammad Yunus", the queen said and added that a "act of justice and the necessary recognition".
The father described this instrument as a "wonderful idealist who went on his way to fight poverty". His work was met 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly at his loan policy.
The first global summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings, I was able to detect constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, served the title "family head", which she was given in Valladolid as a "poor movement".
The Queen of Sofia arranged her speech by calling on the participants to engage in the discussion and search for solutions and thus to continue in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Ministers Trinidad Jiménez declared solidarity "is an ethical imperative", which all democratic states must drive.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the Balo-byte period, because this cooperation is "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans are "serious and decent policies to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, the governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to become the victims of poverty.
For Spain, microloans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
State secretaries for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to people who are all closing the door. Mayor Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city who "opens their doors to the spirit of solidarity that is infectious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and the President of the Christian Democratic Party of Angel Merkel held the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) Congress in July 14th.
The issue of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it became until the autumn, in particular to be satisfied by the members who consider government policy today towards the Rivers and perhaps to the Italians as lax tomorrow.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the Management Board, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegations abstained.
A few minutes of sheep rises to the conclusion of Angela Merkel's performance and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: it responds to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the chancellor in Europe, "the time has come to change."
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, which is clearly the inspiration of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all the twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: against Britain and the CDU leaders think that we will also take the same position as Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is out.
Likewise, delegates rejected the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the representation of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which would clearly increase the weight of Germany.
The mayor was led to calm the climate within his party, the chancellor made several references to Konrád Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not seek to obtain a conference on "small" European states or on States in difficulty willing to criticise arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe is dedicated to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
It's just not fair.
When she remembered that two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most obedient defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is deception in the workplace?
The support shall be provided by the UMP party and the government of the offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on the subject of the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased tension, but is not less clear from the point of view of the Right President's campaign, the right majority wants to focus on job incompetence.
First, because of budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of their incapacity before they start receiving support in the disease.
Of course, without the agreement of the company, an employee who is sick would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
The measures that threaten to cause a lot of bad blood, but according to Les Echos, could bring EUR 280 million.
Also, the measures that would be accompanied by the following measures of symbolic achievement: to give public employees one day of unrestricted incapacity (to date they have no disability against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the legal majority will also engage in the subject of fraud this time on the grounds of work-related irregularities.
"The controls will be much more extensive and further: if you arrive, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned in a conversation with the RTL station provided on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat inappropriate in view of the truth of irregularities in the workplace.
These were actually the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of the political effort that brought their fruits.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse national d'assurance disease (CNAM - State Health Insurance Insurance) more than €237 million was paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 they presented daily allowances with their €11.3 billion 5% of healthcare expenditure.
Of this amount 46% were maternal contributions and labour losses and 54% were labour shortages, i.e. €6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of health costs.
According to Alma Consulting's study, the French had an average of 14.5 working days compared with 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that conceals certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the sites dealing with the work opportunities of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned responded that they had not chosen a day of incapacity.
Another study, this time carried out by health insurance institutions, states that in 2010, 37.8% of the disability was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are not more prone than elsewhere to incapacity for work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
Incapacitating in the event of incapacity is only a very small part against work in black.
As far as deception is concerned, these are just a small amount.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that in 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity "unwarranted or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled deficiencies for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were counted at 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unjustified" cases for several million employees who had a disability.
A number that represents much less than the number expressing work for black.
According to UPP MEP Dominiquea Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between EUR 9 billion and 15 billion missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and, consequently, more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made this statement before Parliament and added that a hundred days given by his government would not be enough to complete this task.
"To re-establish our economy, we need support from our European partners and a new saving budget plan," the chief of government said when he found his first public speech on Wednesday at the beginning of the debate on vote of confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be from now to the end of the year "about 9%" of the gross domestic product after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The law rejects new savings measures
On Monday, the leader of law, Antonis Samaras, expressed his support for the already approved measure in order to try to avoid the debt crisis, but noted that his party did not commit itself to any additional financial measure.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with the MPs for his side of the New Democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting pollution, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economics and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all the parties supporting the proposed measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word is enough and that he does not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, the commission of experts says
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians were killed.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives on the idea of refusing to die.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and take a decision in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the Government amend the criminal law in such a way as to permit the assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears to be necessary in a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning, experts are quoting a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in the 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada is 10th place, the study notes that "medication of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are informed by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to Canada as a whole, while in the province of Quebec this figure is the highest with 86% of those who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicides, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that they are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicides does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also been in control of all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered as criminal, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation leads to any abuse of the application, i.e. euthanasia or assisted suicide against persons who do not or disagree.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference more than many cases of these seizures in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are attracted to euthanasia
Note that according to an analysis conducted by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will enable people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of old or disabled people are less expensive.
With regard to persons involved in assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that criminal law indicate that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires professionals to be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final comfort already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Benefits of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their awards for the conclusions of the report of the Royal Canadian Society of Experts.
Mr. Pierre Deshamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia at the terminal stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of his life and who would be over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," says Pierre Deshamps, who was studying summary news yesterday.
P. Deshamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report built autonomy of persons over all other values that create the social predominance of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
The medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as "a manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is the sole member of the Royal Canadian Society, is particularly in doubt about the data on the absence of doubts in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and the United States of America.
Jordanian King Urges President Assad to Resign
The lady's talking about "competence"
Syria is still more isolated
Bashar al-Assad officials showed up before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on President Bashar al-Assad's Syria intensified, who, with the support of Russia, resisted them and spoke of the "completion" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership was suspended in the League of Arab States, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring country with Syria, sought the opinion in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first ruler of the Arab state yesterday, who called on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military forces were killed "prevented power".
"If Bashar had an interest in his country, he would have to give up, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordanska, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview with BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu said that the efforts of Turkish mediation under the Syrian regime that had been undertaken since the beginning of the year have not been successfully co-ordinated.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said with an insistence on neighboring Syria, which Turkey uses as far as possible.
The United States welcomed the "enhancement of consensus against Assad and the unfair treatment of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are applying as much as hard as possible" to repression in Syria, Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Human Rights Observer announced, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime were killed in Deraa, south of Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilian persons were killed "by gunshots and concentrated shooting from heavy bullets in the city of Jobbar" in Homs.
However, at the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualm's press conference, he estimated that the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
He also responded strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to stop Damascus membership, which he considered to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "does not withdraw", he added with assurance that "combats against Syria do not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering the "Citizen Protection Mechanism" and is planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé is also in favour of the idea of sending UN observers with a view to helping to protect civilians from repression of the regime which he considers to be "paranoid".
A new special meeting of the League will be convened tomorrow in Rabat to raise its opinion on a plan to resolve the crisis decided on 2 December and to include in particular the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities under siege and the release of the prisoners.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saw yesterday's decision of the League of Arab States as "mistakes", while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but it fully defended support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices for Italy
The next head of the Italian government Mario Monti asked for some time to be able to form his team and start applying a program that will contain "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of experts and employers.
It should set up a relatively quiet cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the appointed ministerial president.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented nervously on the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy pays exact terms" with regard to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that he is "certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as President was initially favourable, but the concern was reappeared after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team of technocrats in particular, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "politics".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to President Gianfranca Fini, the new government will get Parliament's trust by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with a view to re-establishing Italy as a strong article in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's speech stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change with the new government".
The European Union is convinced that despite the economic plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is balanced in the 2013 budget, and calls for a new firm measure.
The head of the business union, Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, who meets with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy again "because a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the introductions, "the challenge to seriousness" and "other Italy", is a "social change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A great unknown time will be his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to defend the early elections, because Italy must place state bonds by April 2012 at EUR 200 billion.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop the detonator that was used for nuclear weapons, announced on Tuesday an American non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency when identifying a scientist.
Last week, MAAE announced its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute, a wide range of MAAE documents would have V. Danilenko (n. 1934) worked three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheljabinsk, Ural, where he was to carry out the production of synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the centre to set up a company producing "nano diamonds" in Kyiv.
His company’s economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was to work together on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the MAAE recalls "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was derived from the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during the major part of its work career in this technology within the framework of the country's military nuclear programme from which it came".
Anti-Muslim crime and crime rose by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes targeted against Muslims rose by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase against the 13% treatment against Catholic violence, 4% of the decrease in crimes against Jews and 14% of the total increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "indiscriminate criminal acts" was very easy to fall into 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were based on the FBI's racial differences and 20% religious differences.
"After the fall of 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and crimes stepped up again," the Human Rights First organization, which deals with human rights, stressed, "the growth of anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," the organization added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as serious human rights violations," adds one of the leading actors of Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these crimes," he adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law is the legacy of the time of civil law struggle.
This rule of law was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The website providing microblogging Twitter has changed its design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of its followers, which somehow resembles its Facebook services.
New offers "activity" and "name" allow you to better and know the activity of other people who follow you or those whose answers ("tweets") follow you.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to watch contributions, whether they sign up for new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP spokesperson agency Twitter Carolyn Penner said.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the bonheur des inités, opens up a wider audience with a more comparable handling than that of the des reseaus grand public Facebook and Google+.
On the network users immediately consider the importance of this innovation in their tweets.
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The action will help me better watch some elements of my Twitter," he sent to @dannykronstrom.
Austria
writing of a gold rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write a "golden rule" budget policy into the constitution to reduce the public deficit and avoid this possible reduction in the rating of Austria by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the very social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt with its 74.6% is high above the criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was reduced by only one degree from the AAA to the AA+, we would have to pay every year for three billion euros more," argued Multi-Clergy and Foreign Minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindellegger.
Austria therefore insists on the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government have strongly requested that public deficit reduction and balance of public accounts be recorded in the Constitution or in the law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (HDP) and starting in 2017, the federal state's public structural deficit will not be expected to exceed 0.35% of GDP every year, while the social countries and the foreign countries will have to show a balanced budget.
The objective is to achieve public debt under the 60% criterion set out in the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong only
The node threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to strike again on foreign exchange markets if only to continue strengthening.
"Let's strike as we did last if we find too much instability" in the exchange course, he explained to Senator Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, only again came to the historical values that the Japanese authorities brought to the intervention on 31 October.
On that day Tokyo sold only for dollars to reduce the value of Japanese currency, which has just won the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since that time has it been regularly supported by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in the dark times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar was once again received on Tuesday under 77 yen and the euro fell under a symbolic bed of 105 yen close to the level that led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, it had a value of about 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This increase in Japanese currency damages island exports, as it exacerbates the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the profits obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they transfer them to their domestic currency.
"Japan recovers" from the damage caused by the March earthquake and waves that devastated the Tohok region in the north-east of the country, highlighted Y. Noda, who fears that this betrayal will not only kill in the eggs of the crucible.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% due to the previous quarter) and this was the first time in one year due to a survey of export growth and household consumption of disaster-related disasters.
But the Prime Minister ruled that the high value was not merely "the national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched its political and monetary council on Tuesday in order to take all possible measures leading to a weakening.
But the director-general of this institution Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that BoJ had previously adopted "appropriate measures" indicating that no additional monetary deficits could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased its purchases of State Treasury notes by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) and increased the ceiling of the amounts to purchases of various securities to float with liquids.
Eurozone:
interest rises, storms fail
The risk of the debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, fall into negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris in 10 hours the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"With new tensions around the eurozone loans that are in trouble, markets with stocks around the world continue to generate only a fraction of recent profits."
"The nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of the infection," explains Terry Pratt, owner of IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7%, which suffered due to the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan as well as the rest of the world has eyes on Europe and the change will continue only in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This relaunching of the eurozone's future does not harm the currency itself, which continues in its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reached at the lowest level from a month and a half ago.
In 10 hours, the European currency has a value of $1,3570 when it goes down by 0.4%.
According to the founders, the currency was covered after the party of the CDU Chancellor Angela Merkela at her congress adopted on Monday a proposal that would assume the possibility of coming out of the euro area for countries experiencing difficulties without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates away from the border 6%
Interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
This morning in Tuesday's yield of Italian ten-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of the South European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
Mario Monti, the head of the future Italian government, made an important request on the market for time to correct the situation in Italy that was threatened by the poisoned amount of her debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in the targeted market outlet when elections to the parliamentary Chamber are held in the country on Sunday.
The gap between Germany and Spain's ten-year bonds reached a new historical peak.
Expecting eurozone growth figures
Statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth in the third quarter of the year by 0.4% due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the number below in the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And after all, it's the fourth quarter that economists worry about most.
For its part, Germany has recorded an increase of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must win over dogmats
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term differences or emotions, then it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is natural that the election meeting should be an opportunity to think about such deposits and about a place that takes on energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development has been causing double demand for electricity from 2050 to 2050, if we don't want a significant part of the world's population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and it cannot be forgotten, however, that it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a view to combating climate change, which is the subject that is currently out of ecological debates.
An accident in Fukushima has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany is left alone in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case of Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which only considers the last generation power plant to be the right building.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to make a decision in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding the construction of one power plant interrupted by the Three Mile Island power plant.
If a German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality will resist it.
The Berlin election is due to the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of electricity on land gas and coal.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt over the next few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of which it collects its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are higher than 65%, or 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, because of the invariability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity bill of 40% higher than the amount paid by the French households.
While in the globalised energy economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintaining industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the advantages of the most expensive electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would result in a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illustrative beautiful declaration of the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay, just as they do not, in principle, oppose this energy, as the public opinion polls show.
Note that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build a sector of 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 jobs.
Strongly exportable sectors attract large quantities of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises that create jobs that cannot be moved abroad.
If France decided to abandon the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would amount to EUR 6 billion per year, which the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant would command the nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while the collapse of its manufacturer was planned?
In solving the energy equation, it is necessary to assume that there is no magic source for energy production, that there is no devil.
The development of low-carbon installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy facilities carried out by the French industrial group AREVA shall testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Office, which carries out uncompromising and transparent monitoring of current nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have a sense of security in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one on Three Mile Island was in normal operation and was without human sacrifice and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of a reactor and unexplainable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it did in the past.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor represents concepts capable of coping with such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider that stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to competitors in the AREVA group and EDF and opening the way for them to strengthen their leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machines control the debate so crucial for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy carried out by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from different angles - the payment of police, courts and administrative detailed numbers policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "country of human rights", which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative challenge, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of Interior (see Libération's list of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, bees and serviettes".
But until now, it's only been split under economics.
It must be said that in this area there is quite a wide correlation between the left and the right.
Right then in 1976, Jacques Chirac made his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left of Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France "could not accept all the world's woes".
The only difference is the degree of greatness
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the hordes of Polish installers in the French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are regarded as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of greatness that we are reluctant to offer to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande restricts itself to banality when it turns out that joint development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economics Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, page 352): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that immigrants accept.
Restrictions on immigration protect growth and employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than French employees by working in sectors where there is a shortage of workers.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not reach French employees and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough for a job offer.
Positive impact on wages
Like the surgeon, there will be difficulties with work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these additions between France and migrants cause immigrants' incomes to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% results in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributed to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalised immigrants among American Nobel Prize holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
In European countries, migrants are also net contributors to social systems on average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that one immigrant will come to Germany at 30 years of age to bring a net contribution to public budgets for his entire life (e.g., a minus expenditure) of EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his desire at the beginning of his mandate to come for the missing percentage of growth "with appreciated teeth".
Those teeth serving to reflect immigrants had a very different effect.
Europe has invented democracy, left to think about European democracy
Democracy is rare and very fragile.
The European continent should remember this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some people could have believed that to definitely triumph over their enemies, democracy would be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most straightforward way possible.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
General electoral law, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "printing tool" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, division and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is precisely the beginning of the political and democracy crisis.
The recognition of the Greek referendum of type yes-will not have in this direction the value of double detection: the detection of the need for a great return of political power, but also the detection of the worrying feeling of his inability, his disadvantage.
This ambition must be thought of in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic coalition have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
There is nothing we can get if we require a number of national referendums organized according to necessity and disorganisation.
White displayed to the European absolute monarch or jump with tied legs to empty nationalist depths: what a choice for citizens!
No, we do not want Gilotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
That is why it is the whole of Europe that is fighting against the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from their inability and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are at rest in transferring sovereignty to Europe - but it is a whole Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each one of its nations.
It is urgent to restore the governance of the European project of democratic excellence.
Because only together will the Europeans be able to reduce their debt burden, rid themselves of market governments and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will be a European decision that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to ruin.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly demanding the European Economic Government.
Wake up.
But think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, it would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution in interest couldn't be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic excellence.
Let's become Europeans to build Europe.
"Unplugged" chip cards are being spread
In the optimistic atmosphere it opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world fair of chip carts.
In 2011, according to the Eurosmart office, it is expected that an increase in global sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, calls with a SIM card) would result in 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable segment is a wireless technology that allows you to pay in bulk transport or cut purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million digital cards against 320 million sold a year ago!
In 2012, their share should still rise (expected 580 million units) and reach about 10% of the total market with digital cards (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC country, Europe is getting a field in no contact payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, there are smaller beginnings: 400,000 visa-free cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million pass mastercards this year.
In order to set up a higher speed level, it is necessary to equip their clients from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed themselves to systematically distributing their customers without touch cards in the future," says Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks testing mobile payment
But this is just the first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They're late."
"But it should come to their true diversion next year."
"For 2012 we estimate their sales worldwide for 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are already getting ready.
The Bank Credit Farm yesterday announced the launch of a test carried out in the city of Cain, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices will provide about 200 clients and employees with free access payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société General announced yesterday that he was preparing to launch an offer allowing her clients to pay their mobile phone without contact.
The terrorist front goes from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicion that there are ties between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, the deputy Algerian minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "no confidence" about it ever since.
"The manner in which both organisations operate and reports of intelligence services show that there is great cooperation among them," he explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help to shed light on the connecting bridges.
After AQMI members were taken from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappings during the operation carried out by special French units.
After the attack, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Bone
The analysis of calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), researchers are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to the Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, which is the cobblestone of Boko Haram, and the other leads to a person who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It's progress, but there's no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active," Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures that have since involved human victims or increasingly more complex explosive devices of the same manner of implementation as the devices used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community in front of Washington has developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems of Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quick success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, schools and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the Haoussa language means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a link has a rapid success.
The sect politicises and demands strict respect for Islamic Sharia's law, while its steps begin to fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the Boko Haram troops became extremely active and multiplied their attacks on the police station.
The government's reaction is as usual still the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of Mohammed Joseph is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its position in the north.
On Christmas 2010 there will be an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will be killed, followed by another in Abuja's capital.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters during his first suicide attack.
And in August, the United Nations local government will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, is worrying all security specialists from now on.
Now, when Al-Qajda of Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and games and Somalis from Al-Shahab's movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in a discussion with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe, he said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "deliver all information".
The World According to the Candidates to the President
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel's aid, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are leading to simplification and ignorance.
Can America's weakened crisis manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
At the hearing of the presidential candidates, the voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated the horrendous statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is already a traditionally strong point of the Republic.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or the help of Israel are intertwined.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened the Chinese's vocation before the World Trade Organisation and their accusation "for manipulation with their currency", which is a portable theme in the Americas that has spread the migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
That's worse if this has to contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost collapsed in a position that "feels" emotions.
He demanded a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last seats in the polls, remains unheard of.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if they fail to meet the sanctions of stopping his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," said the fanfaron.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel's military assistance, accusing Obama of being disappointed in his obligations to this partner.
The company Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates a shameful ignorance of documents.
Recently he called for a strong stance against the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capacities" - obviously unknown fact that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he's ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from the Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy in 2008.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the banished "boys" from Iraq, his excuses about Libya, and thus assign him a weak label.
But the attack isn't easy.
The population is assessing the national security policy of President Obama, who removed Ben Ladin, more positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military intervention that leads to obstruction.
And with the arguments that it is necessary to rebuild America economically so that its leading position can be revived, Obama knocks on the right place.
Nord Stream, new entrance port of Russian gas to Europe
The far-off Nord Stream pipeline, which connects eastern Europe directly to Russia and led by the Baltic Sea, has begun to operate.
It has to add gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated last Tuesday in the launch of the North Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitrij Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have jointly turned the control valve around the control valve of the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
This new pipeline will start to flow to Western Europe every year 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas with the first pipes of 1,224 km long connecting the Petrograd region to the Mecklenburg-Pomorjana country.
The second pipeline to be completed at the end of 2012 will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is a quantity equal to the total French consumption.
And it is already recalled that the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same path.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries protested strongly against the project.
Nord Stream will actually be able to deliver gas directly to Germany without being led by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pressuring Russia to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
The most powerful statement was made by Warsaw when she did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to "the new German-Soviet pact", with an appeal to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means saying it's a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases in support of this Russian project.
But it is at the price of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created gaps between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia has barely managed to impose its vision of a direct link between Russia and the rich western states with high gas consumption, whose deposits are approaching its end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new carpet that connects us organically," said François Fillon at the opening of this pipeline and demonstrated the point where large gas contracts are both politically and economically.
This explains the broad smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in a large number in Lubmin, the gas pipeline.
Building this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete coat to protect it from sea-going shells.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
It was necessary to avoid the mine fields from the second world war.
"For their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
The measures for the protection of fauna and flora were also needed.
The single tube is a long metalhad weighing 242 Eiffelovek, which has never been interrupted by valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
A control area was to be built near Sweden, but the leading project rejected it when the Swedes were only a little eager to see the Russian state company, as it was constantly settled on their coast.
"In case of confusion, we will stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of insecurity, gas contained in the gas pipeline shall be avoided from entering the air.
But this case is considered by the builder to be unlikely, for weights were designed to produce uncertainty once in 100,000 years.
The control of the external gas pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot towed by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This 1-metre tube-shaped device is inserted into the tube and is pressed by gas.
For the purpose of the three-day journey, 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on any deformation of the metal parts.
The remote pipeline was designed to function for 50 years without having to be the smallest repair.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The lead position remains in Gazprom, which holds 51%.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has a residence in Zug, Switzerland, where tax is extremely beneficial.
Gazprom subsequently rented this company for five years by a contract that can be renewed, all its gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will have profits from total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline was provided by 30% of the shareholders and by 70% of the bank loans.
Total labour costs should reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that their costs will be reimbursed, because the risk only takes Gazprom.
The pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy shore with pine forests.
The valves are four and a half feet high, forming an output gate of gas.
Sensors shall measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the gas before being transported to the German pipelines.
From last Tuesday, this terminal takes one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is achieved, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Brand Recorder
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to re-supply writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing at the light of the candle.
The writer of Moleskine is easily recognizable by his black area boards and his sheets of white paint as if they were old.
In fact, the writer of Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo living in Milan will decide to place on the market a new but distinguished designer.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is taken away from the introduction of a new product.
The handwriting is inspired by the old manufacturing technique "moleskin" (i.e. imitation leather) which is used for adjusting the surface of the spoons.
This type of recorder was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has returned to the shape of an old and forgotten object, which has been the icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then has become the leader of the fashion brand.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is remote from hidden production from the first years when only 3,000 subscribers were created.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's hard to put together some art portrait of the buyer, because we're going to take business as well as students or professionals.
The image of the writer of Moleskine is that his owners are people of cosmopolitan, culture and open spirit.
A small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred employees and since 2008 it has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
Its entrants spread to bookstores and through a chain of FNAC stores into small shops in the middle of cities where he was able to raise his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this need for a new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the writer Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their writer.
In August, at the Locarn Film Festival, she also introduced a new record sheet to remind Leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pens, stickers on notebooks ... The brand is expanding throughout the range of carriers.
The success that sparked envy: in the fall of 2006, Mode Modo was bought by the investment funds of SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the proportion of unemployed people with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today it opens 15. Week for the employment of disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is even twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is that exciting?
"No, Mr. Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The steps achieved in 15 years are remarkable."
"At that time there were no percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"No matter how much remains to be done."
It should be said that for unemployed persons with disabilities there are numerous obstacles to their entry into work.
This is the elderly person: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have maturity, and only 10,000 out of 2.3 million high school students are disabled.
And finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are criteria that are particularly complicated to return to employment and which are "the core problem", according to Christian Grapina, Director General of the Tremplín Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses accept disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that are definitely developing, but too slow.
The study conducted in April by IMS-Entrepreneurre pour la Cité found that the managers questioned had "a poor level of knowledge about disabled persons" with "excessive idea of persons on the wheelchair and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the objectives of 6% of disabled workers laid down in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures from 2008 show a figure of 2.6%.
"Now we're moving about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph's organization, entrusted with the collection of fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "accompanied" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with between 20 and 49 employees employ people with disabilities versus 82% of businesses with between 100 and 199 employees.
"Hazard, what a fortune."
Before Tuesday evening (20h45), French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We're not going so far to write that there's been a collapse between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to themselves on the stage stage of Stade de France briefly and well Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard calmed down.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am with Eden and his progress is very happy, and the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," says a French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in the national team's club matches and matches," that's the same thing, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my badge."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "enlighten".
You can't mention the term "rejoice."
To play against Bleus, who has encouraged them for 7 years and in their winnings in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
More than that, because they're "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adel (Rami)", he recalls.
"We crossed immediately."
"Can play against them, it's just pleasure!"
Well-willed Leekens also referred to pride.
"Horse" to beat the "saint" -- Christmas.
"Hrodost" also found in the quality of "neighbors" that France became a very high-level team for something more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he woke up.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 in a plane with French direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will grow big," he said.
"We're just building something, players are ambitious, they're healthy hungry."
"You will realize this for the next match." Including France.
Portugal very self-conscious
The Portuguese spy Paulo Bento launches with great optimism a barbarism against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there was a lack of realism for both teams.
"At the end of those 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. Portugal's football performance, with which he's been driving since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is happy to share in a 90-minute reality.
There is still one match and one match - Bosnia.
With the awareness of Friday's result (0-0) in God's Hell Zenice it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour's weight, but it was not able to give him such a rare goal that would lead him down.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk in itself because we didn't go out naked."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will stand before the audience who should create a hot tub there, even though the game certainly appears as "very balanced", says the optimist, but vividly considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a top," said a 20-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at Euro 2012," the successor Carlos Queiroze relativized.
An indecisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to target and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for the Bosnians who also need to score.
"It's a good result, however, that contains the risk, because we didn't go out," says Bento.
"We will play against a team with great technical qualities and have players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing the Bosnian team right from the start of the maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think."
It's a good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
