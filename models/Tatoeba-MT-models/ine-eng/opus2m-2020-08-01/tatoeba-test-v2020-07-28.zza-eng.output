Mary's rent.
It isn't European nor won't be European.
"It's not me?" "No."
You're right, aren't you?
That's why I'm here.
And I'm gonna have an old man.
That's how she feels.
Tom zey toya niyo.
You don't know what you're talking about?
Analyst needs root.
It won't take long for nothing.
No one's gonna die.
What's the matter with her?
Oh, who's coming for me?
And, by the way, by the way, by the way, by the way!
He's gonna be all right.
The others closed their doors, Jack.
By no means!
Your right foot is full.
It's all right, Tom.
I'll be fine.
It won't take long for nothing more.
Don't I kiss?
He's right here.
What's wrong with you?
It's over.
Awa Tommy was there.
It's been a long time.
Where about?
It's okay, Tommy.
This is Tommy.
But he's gone.
Tom prayed.
I'm sorry.
The amount of time each player has to move in the sky map.
Take your time.
That's what I'm talking about.
We're sweating, aren't we?
And you're an old man.
It was the coldest part of the night.
This topic is not relevant.
I'm so sorry.
That's why you're here.
Is that a savl savl' yu vei?
You're a stranger.
Pizza is bis.
Does Paul have Lily's handkerchief?
I'll be right back.
It's Mary teweno.
I don't know.
Don't you dare!
I'm sorry.
I'll be right down.
Tusnelda is an Armenian actor.
I don't know what to do.
The twins.
You're not left in Tom's room.
You're still going to fall?
It's time for the show.
What about the euro?
You're on your way.
It's not the coldest winter I've ever met.
Come on, Timmy.
I'd love to.
I'll be right back.
I wouldn't believe it.
I don't have a rocket.
Who's that?
I'm sorry, Tom.
From the time of the check.
I'll be right back.
That's enough.
If you don't know what to do.
I don't know.
I don't know Tommy.
You know what?
And your father says to me, "What's the smell?"
I'm not afraid.
I'll bet you didn't.
Don't you think so.
I'll see you later.
Did you send him back to Europe?
I'm not afraid
Tom will be back in the morning.
He's got to go to bed with his wife.
Eddie's week.
I'll be damned if you'll excuse me.
You won't be able to do that.
What, you're hot with this, you're hot with this?
No, you're not.
Who's the fat guy?
Tusnelda is an Armenian actor.
The end of the day.
He's in the middle of nowhere.
It's a beer.
Syanra is a big player.
He'll never see you again.
I don't know.
It's the secret of all being, of course, the secret of all being.
What's the matter with you?
His nose was deep in his throat.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Tom and I know.
It's not too late.
That's it, my lord.
It's egile niyé.
And it's all new.
It won't take long for nothing.
But Tom's a drunk.
Mayé Eriné.
The euro is the only way to get away with it.
And she's got her own house, and she's got her own house.
I'm gonna drink to the bathroom. I'm gonna get a drink.
I don't know.
I'm gonna be fine with you.
I'm gonna have to go.
What time is it?
Don't you know why we're dying?
Note, I'm not crazy.
He is there and is there.
I'm afraid so.
It's very likely that the system will rise.
No, my God, I am not born.
It's just that Tom.
Ez Tomra you don't have.
Candé in good paw.
Just keep quiet.
He came to me later.
Well, that's what I'm talking about.
There's no space left in that room but a rock.
You must love her dead.
It's time to finish.
The euro is not enough.
It's our turn.
We're a cat?
There's nothing wrong with that.
I'm new to Tom.
Is that what it is?
Oh, my God, I'm so glad to be here.
At the price of where?
That's right.
You're gonna drink it.
Is that why I'm freaking out?
Red, made fae'mchered
It's just the end of my story.
He's got a hole in his neck.
Eza is gone.
What's the problem?
No, it's not a big deal.
Mary was hurt.
Tomdo qayte is good.
What's her name?
It's a nebula.
It's okay.
You're done with your feet and your feet.
Oh, thank you.
I don't know if it's true.
We had a funny cry.
And I know what it's like.
You're welcome, you're welcome.
You're welcome.
I am new.
"The date is the date?" "The date is the end!"
This isn't a good idea.
As the snow fell, the snow fell.
It's the first time I've ever seen him.
He's in the bathroom, he's in the bathroom.
You won't know who I am anymore.
It doesn't matter.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
History of the seashore.
I don't know.
It was too late.
It's just that Tom and Mary were together.
Well, you're welcome.
I won't tell you what to do.
Ujad do you want this?
He hasn't been edited yet, so it's a big deal.
- Shut up! - Shut up!
How's Tom Boston doing?
Ice pellet
Let's go. Let's go.
I'm not gonna take that anymore.
Tommy and Boy Kerd.
It's your turn.
I'm just trying to make sure you don't want to.
I'd like to see some germs.
I'm sorry, Tom.
And, of course, it's your turn.
It's my birthday party.
And you're so cool with your hair.
Did you ever drink?
Tommy's payroll.
Take care of yourself!
I don't know.
Where's that?
There's no need to complicate his life.
It won't take long for that to happen.
I mean, that kind of thing.
My son-in-law Qayte is fine.
Tommy was Mary's key.
It's my turn to roll.
Tom's in the middle of his mind.
Made Tomi tommy tommy.
It's my fault, Charley.
It wasn't your turn to roll.
You don't know.
How's it going?
That's it.
It's my fault.
It's so hot.
You're welcome.
It's on the ground floor.
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna show you what this is like.
It's been a long time, isn't it?
What's the matter with you?
Is this the end of the line?
It's your turn. I'll take care of you.
My job.
It's wintertime.
She's got a nice wife.
It's hot!
I'm out of here.
Do you want to keep this secret?
I lost my queen.
No, it's not my fault.
That's not true.
It's summer time.
I sold and bought a peyhesyaya.
What's wrong with you?
I'm fine.
I can't wait to see you.
She doesn't know what to expect in the months.
My tears welled up Toma.
Who's that?
It's okay.
It's too late.
What's Tom doing?
I'm done.
No matter what happens, it's just a little bit more serious.
Good evening.
Qalé is my twin.
Tom Niyo.
Sit down.
Ezi is back!
Tom fucking niyo.
What's the matter with you?
A euro for yourself?
I swear to God, I'm sorry.
It's all dark.
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey, hey!
Tom's dead.
No, I'm not afraid
And he is closer to the well.
Hanni at Nanni Dıleté.
I'll keep you safe.
Tomdo, he's never seen anyone before.
Do you know what Tom looks like?
If they hadn't escaped, they'd have been killed.
It's okay.
I'll see you tonight.
Keynek's got a paycheck.
Tom was taken to bed.
Oh, my God.
I'm afraid so.
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Is that how you feel?
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Dicki's like, "I don't think so."
It's too late.
There are 28 locks left.
He won't mind my dinner.
It's too bad Tommy.
Tom took Jackie's hand.
Are you sure about Tomdo?
What are we gonna do?
That's what I'm talking about.
Tom, this is the new wine!
But the closer we get to the mirror, the stronger it becomes
I'm sick and shit.
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
It's a warm, warm rock.
He's in the middle of nowhere.
Muted
Or am I gone?
You don't know what to do with all the heat.
Have you ever seen Tom grow a cow?
That's not true.
Don't ask me this again.
He's not gonna make it.
No hint available.
I'm sorry, Tom.
His mother drew back with her voice
Is that what you're saying?
He's safe.
The end of the canvas.
You're safe.
Key is Emily.
Do I know where the cow is?
Good and big.
What's the matter with you?
Tom's on duty?
Is that right?
Is that what you're coming for?
Your old Tom, it's me.
What do you know?
I'll see. Are you okay?
What's wrong with you?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm gonna kill you!
Tom's pretty cool.
I don't know what Tommy's doing.
The earth's orbit is sharper than ever before.
Why don't you know what's going on?
This is a joke!
Mary did not know me.
After all, I'm fine.
You're welcome.
It was too late for Tom.
It's about the euro.
Did you know that she's pregnant?
It's high and it's good.
I don't want to see you.
That's right, that's right.
She is so much appreciated by the people.
Tom, I don't know where it is.
Tom doesn't look, does he?
Is that the source of nino?
Tom'o never did.
I'm in Keyaya and I'm in charge.
The key's too high.
It won't hurt. It's cool.
We're done!
No, no, no.
Don't take it easy.
Are you out of your mind?
You're fucking niya, aren't you?
Right - a little, left - a little..., pear pear.
What's the matter with you?
That's Tom.
I won't be late.
She's in love.
Tomdo is here.
You are my friend.
Sweet Tom.
It's not that bad.
Why don't you ask me?
Don't you want to cry?
It's the thickest place in the world.
Tom fucked his ass.
Tom's gonna die.
I'm gonna have an old man.
Oh, my God.
I think I'm good.
Maybe I don't pay for it.
Take it and make a mistake.
He'll be fine at the moment.
This is the van's corner.
That's better.
I've been sold a few peyhesyayas.
It's cancer.
I mean, Mary's been drinking like a baby.
It wasn't my fault.
And it's not like hesker's shirt.
It's Tommy's menu.
This isn't going to work.
I'm gonna have to show you what I'm doing.
My dad would say, "What's wrong with you?
That's why the hot dog was dead.
Did he fall asleep?
Most people don't like it anymore.
I'm sorry.
You won't be less than just a few minutes.
I'm so sorry.
You're a friend of yours?
It's stuck.
That's what this is all about.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'll try my best.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Tom's gone.
You don't even know a cat?
He wants to wake up and cry for help.
I'm gonna be tough.
It's okay?
Mary and Zana.
I don't know who you're talking about, do you?
I'm a good friend.
No. He's hot.
Who's this, what's wrong with you?
Tom's name is Mary.
How long have you been doing this?
It's just a drink.
In the summer.
You're so cool with me.
Is that the source of nino?
But he did.
What's Tommy's dream?
And my name is xu or va.
It's a secret.
It's too hard to rock.
Maya and me.
It's over.
What's the matter with you?
How many keys is that?
I want you to edit it.
"Ez?" "Eh, Ti!"
Is it Tomi's turn?
He's squeezing that way.
No need for an open house.
Are you ready?
What's the deal with that?
My father loved me.
You're welcome.
She's pregnant, she's pregnant.
He's the only girl in the world.
Who's that Tom's aunt?
I'm sorry.
Your right foot hit me.
I'm out of the horse's bag.
The closer you feel, the closer you feel.
Are you sure you don't want to laugh?
I've had a lot of fun.
Is that gonna be so cool?
Tom's funny.
Well, don't sit down.
His wife is dead.
I'm kidding.
I'm sorry.
I'll take my lead.
Is that you?
It's your turn to fall.
You're my friend.
I'm not going to make it.
So take care of her.
Yeah, and zerre.
I don't know about that.
I'm sorry.
That's good for me.
What's wrong with you?
Sewl is Mary's.
What's wrong with you?
You can't take the heat off your ass.
Rock and avan.
It's winter.
His heart is so hot
I don't want you to do that.
This is Mary's friend.
Tom Xinto?
There's a network.
Don't worry about it.
It's just that it's just the network that's going to blow up.
Did you say anything like that?
It's the hottest part of my life.
At the price of ya.
Tom died.
You're welcome.
It's springtime.
That's right.
How's it going?
I'm fucking with you!
Tommie's heart went out to her.
Is that your yeno coming?
Did you get her?
Did he grow old?
You can't do it.
I don't think so.
Is that how you feel?
I'm in the van.
There's a lock on the door.
Made him feel better.
You're welcome.
It's about to fall.
Tom, enjoy it!
Tom, what's wrong with you?
The ercan.
Come on, man.
Zee, what is she gonna do?
What's the matter with you?
Tom's not the fault.
And the key to the bear.
No, it's not.
Get out of the way.
You're doing this, aren't you?
Don't look at Tomdo's keyed.
Tom's client?
I'm so sorry.
It's Tom's daughter-in-law.
Jew man.
Tom, are you kidding me?
You have already seen a locker.
I'm not the only one who's flying.
It's no wonder she's home.
What's the lockdown?
It was a very serious announcement.
It could have been dark.
No such key.
Tom and hard.
It's good to meet you.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
What's the matter?
Tom just laughed.
Serseya, but you're sweet.
My name is Maria Saraya.
I'm sorry.
My sister loved Thomas.
You're ready to go?
Where's our tip?
It's too late to make a move.
Did you get it?
It's about time.
Qayila and I'm fine.
It's not true.
Tommy's gonna be there.
I'll see you soon.
I don't care what you're saying.
It's worth a while.
Well, I guess it's not a day.
Did you fall in love with him?
