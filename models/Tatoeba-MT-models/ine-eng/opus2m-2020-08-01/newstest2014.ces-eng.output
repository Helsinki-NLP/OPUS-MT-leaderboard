Black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying hard to find money to repair cutting off the road network, many start to see solutions in a small black box that easily enters the device board of your car.
The devices that follow every kilometer that the driver eats and which transmits this information to the authorities are the core of Washington's controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renew the obsolete system of financing American highways.
Usually, the gradual design of roads has suddenly led to intensive debate and the creation of the most diverse companies.
The Liberals met with groups of environmentalists and were lobbying for the government to use these small boxes, which would record captured kilometres and perhaps even where you are going – and then use this information to collect the tax.
Tea party's scared.
The US Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree to continue, some states don't expect anything.
They find out how they can move to the system where the driver pays for the miles of the road he is heading.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS surveillance.
This is a real need for our nation.
"It is a matter of how we can choose," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of State Administration in southern California, who is planning to start monitoring the kilometres captured by each California motorist in 2025.
It will change the way we pay these taxes.
That's what this technology is for.
It is therefore the fact that the Road Trust Fund financed by taxes paid by Americans at pump stations is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars eat a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians tend to raise taxes only by one cent.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed a tracking device up to 500 cars to test this payment system within a mile.
"For a long time it seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
The experts refer to it as a user fee according to the number of kilometres taken.
It is no surprise that this idea is like urbanist liberals because taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, for example, which can help limit traffic congestion and greenhouse gas generation.
California designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Schuster (Pensylvanie representative), Chairman of the Committee on Transport, said that he also sees this as the most effective long-term alternative.
The representatives of the Free Market from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will be paid for miles.
"It's not tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Strategy in Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who, in 2011 Congress, offered to pay for a mile away.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project to cover about 10,000 cars.
However, the management of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the population’s component, whose daily life often means harming many kilometres of work outside the city.
However, several states and cities proceed ahead on their own.
The most horny is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the State tax for miles trapped instead of the gas tax.
The pilot project's already finished.
New York's just investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent in freight cars.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with the coastal states of the East (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, does not only have a standstill.
In Nevada, where the facility had recently equipped about 50 cars volunteers, the drivers were concerned by the government’s ability to monitor every move.
"The concerns regarding the monitoring of Big Brother and similar matters were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs the management of the strategy and operation at the Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the United States Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its websites: “It would be very easy to turn these facilities into full-scale monitoring facilities.”
There is no need to build an enormous heavy-duty technological infrastructure that is inevitably extended to the record of daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
The problem is that there are several states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many kilometers the car will be found, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
Hon has brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in the government's aid action in taxing drivers.
She wanted to go into the emerging market to ensure legal liability where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they ate.
But this device that is testing attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only provides a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go unless you follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, there have been a number of major errors.
There are much cheaper and less inconspicuous ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead they will decide to pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of kilometres seized by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, it is hoped that a discreet public will come to this concept, if the facility is able to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to make it possible to pay charges for parking hours in order to provide insurance according to the kilometres involved and to collect data on the speed of other drivers so that drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be willing to take part in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's project document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussion about pay per kilometer is not just a huge problem.
Officials of the Metropolitan Committee for Transport in the San Francisco Bay area say Congress could easily solve a problem with a branched Road Trust Fund by increasing the tax on petrol.
A single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not need a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There is no need for any radical operation when the rich enough to take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
ČSSD negotiates Saturday.
Social democracy is talking and planning a common process.
If the social democrats are confused within a few weeks, they will be sitting at the negotiating table with perfectly tied partners who will put on the table a complete list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
The ČSSD envoys will then either crush the acidic coalition threat, or move on to the flourishing minority government.
After four days of God’s Sabbath, when he was on the wane of compassion, he was first attacked.
Yesterday he was unable to control the political crime and, above all, to bring the proven liar to his resignation.
Only he is hereby approved as a negotiator, the other members of the team shall be allowed until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (OECD).
I apologized to the members of the jury and now to the citizens.
He doesn't lie in his personal life or in his public life.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek after the conduct of the unscrupulous social democracy.
He added that he's not in the post of First Vice-President.
"I'll make my decision on November 10th," Hasek said.
Similarly, ČSSD Vice-President Zdeněk Škromach and Head of Mission Club Jerome Tejc spoke.
He warned, however, that he was elected only two days ago.
Both MPs then declared that they would do their best to make the 50-member club ČSSD sound one vote.
The absurd theatre was crowned by Michael Hasek by saying, "I am a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to her brand and I have respected the decision of the party authorities."
He's got another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he forget, when he called for Sobotk's resignation and his dismissal from the negotiating team, that in August, the UVV turned 57 percent to the fact that Bohuslav Sobotka was the candidate of the party to the prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, produced a powerful army of enemies with the call of ÚVV until next week.
Its opponents have ten days to flood the 192 members of this body's e-mails and the media with the most varied tastes and fam, possibly recall the real mistakes of Sobotk's political career.
The dirty laundry will be thoroughly washed, the signs of dark connections between the Zdenýk Zdenýk Bakal and the Sobotk wing will appear.
The friendly relationship of Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer of the Council of the Humble will be discussed.
There are disputes in the Yugoslav or Moravian Organisation of ČSSD.
The words of the island prime minister and the Sobotk union of Peter Kainnar are warning: "I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not rule the idiots."
If ÚVV met this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will blow their heads up and stay.
And now the victorious chief of the ČSSD will end with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor about problems with OH in Soči: Communication with Russia is demanding
The corners of his mouth indicate an inexhaustible smile and then only deep breaths: "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the organizational team of the Olympics in Soči 2014 is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works anyway," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A number of things are slowing down and not exactly.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information on key things no longer.
Maybe we've spent three months adding to us how to officially label individual villages so that we can do a whole series of things.
We're still waiting and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
A number of things still communicate.
Is there at least an Olympic village already delivered?
But it's no longer a catastrophic state.
A month ago, we were walking through empty rooms.
The houses are worth it.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you need some finished floors?
It's just basic concrete, so it was like a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there's a danger that when we get there on January 26th as a forebear, we'll still feel the glue.
And if they didn't fight, what would happen?
President Putin would you like to push an army there?
That's probably how it's gonna work.
Just so it's not that the Olympic Village = the village's descendants.
They're more at risk of not achieving, for example, the road change, they don't know the details.
Maybe they'll have their way in such a state that we're gonna have to take some holini from the London games.
But I believe they're kind of giving it up.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the Krasbressers will be on their way to the three that they've left.
There's no one to doubt about Martin Sáblík's speedbroker, either, but otherwise it's in progress.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing's gonna happen, I should be flying there by January 26.
We know what houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We've even measured some things ourselves a meter so that we don't just believe the charts.
We're also preparing a whole series of other things, including transportation.
And what does the Head of Mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports, plus I am making a regular agenda for communication with the Soči organizational committee.
Putin promised the ecological Olympics, his plan to hate a huge secret.
Winter sports fans are already cutting a meter to start the Olympics in Soci, while others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, whether they start in February, are facing another scandal.
According to all, the Russians fail to fulfill their promise that the preparation and performance of the game will not interfere with the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Kavkaz, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will die.
The rest after the Olympics in Vancouver had a very high-quality Russian bat, Canadian games were recorded as the most environmentally friendly in history.
It seems, however, that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize the games with "zero waste" has long since taken its place.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered a large structure of construction material in the village of Achstyr near Soči last week.
Thus, the building material, tires, canisters and insulation foams were found in August, and they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have gone missing.
Just for a second.
Last week, the reporters were given a view of the three-foot football game.
Not the only one, in the area of places such as this, described the British newspaper The Times.
On the spot are Russian railways, a state monopoly that builds about sixty-kilometres of road between the airport in Soca and the sports resort.
The company, which already had 280 billion rubles, led one of the close Putin co-workers of Vladimir Jakunin.
In August the railways were banned from having one of the subcontractors set up.
Local residents are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achtyra, they've been driving trucks full of waste for all three days and nights.
According to experts, the waste is contaminated by the local river Mjemto, other rivers and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates soch water flows over the next ten to fifteen years," British newspaper Vladimir Kimaev of the EWNC ecological non-profit organization said.
Illegal compositions are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison: Soci games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing amounted to $43 billion.
Last year's games in London amounted to only 19 billion and the above-mentioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns, if there is enough snow, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working at the exhibition.
Last month one of the employees put his mouth on the protest that he didn't get two months paid.
Many are also afraid how Russian organizers break up with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during the game.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple grew up living with their parents, a new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is somehow connected.
The requirement further stated that two generations would live in the house who would want to live together, but each should have its own clearly separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly connected land.
The architects therefore decided to place each household into one of the master's houses.
"When making a proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several journeys through the exterior of the object, so everyone realizes the presence of others, but they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The home of the parents is at the garden level with an old borović, to which family traditions and memories are weighed.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, which is different from the different final design of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is of concrete, the surface of which was created by panels of tiles, the part where the office is, is rejected white and the remaining elements remain in the clean concrete implementation without any further adjustments.
Many walls of the house are completely exposed, which makes the interior of the house very connected to the exterior.
The home of parents, more accurate kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior to the exterior is abrasive of the side wall, which starts on the garden and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house with the main entrance into the hall and then walk down the stairs into their room.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their construction enables them to lose many natural light through cascades.
This is exactly what the architects were trying to distinguish the house from others and impress him with something unique.
The home of the young couple is arranged as an open space with a kitchenette, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace, it's only a glass wall with a sliding door.

The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely walks on the terrace, from which is a nice view of the Tokyo Gulf.
The single office in the highest stairs is captured in a clean combination of white and black.
The hall is the dominant element of the interior of the house.

Defend academic freedoms, it pays for Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators and seniors in several countries to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've been seeing more or less success.
To the Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the speech of the honorary President SPOZ - Zemanovci during the pre-election period, even received a verdict in the form of a non-invitation to the celebration of the Czech State's celebration.
Here is a list of school representatives who have not been so static and visited Miloše Zeman: High technical education in Brno, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, High Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolina, University of J.E. Purkyna in Ústí nad Labem.
We now meet in Pardubice with the continuation of policy promotion in high schools.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you stayed for example in the office of mayor of a smaller city.
Do you want to join the Heitmans of the ČSSD, who are currently performing parliamentary and heitman functions and as well as they are degrading both appointments?
That's why you're telling people that they can handle both of these demanding functions on the left-hand side.
I know, here's Michael Haška's example, who manages even a few dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly the example of the person you should be driving.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr Štěpánka Frankove, who rather left the post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean function is that you violate the apolyticity of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the pardubic ODS sees your current effect on both positions as an advantage for the University.
But you'll be able to help your own school without being a dean.
I think that the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig will have your students.
So consider your resignation and keep your face down.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that your voters are counting on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovic's bubbles, chemistry doesn't add to it
More than a thousand tons of oxygenated vegetables want to be produced in the coming months in the Slovak Fruit of Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season here began in October and will last about half a year.
A healthy sense of humor here since 1925 is still produced in a traditional way, i.e. smoking directly in large dances.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our workers have been on the move for almost a ten-kilometre route.
Fifteen to thirty tons of greens will enter each of the ten tanks, filling one in three shifts," said the director of the Slovak Frut David Kladrob race.
The feral heads drive directly from their fields mainly from Ostrožska and Breclavska.
The workers of Fruity then clean the vegetables, remove the cookies and throw them into the bowl.
From here the already fenced green falls into six-metre deep pools, where they work tirelessly in white clothes and gowns.
That's what makes the air feel uncomfortable.
The last wet layer of the will is covered with a patch and weighed down by water.
"The green gourmet then matures six to eight weeks for spontaneous milking without any additives to support it," said Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to production under domestic conditions, individual layers of workers spray salt and germ.
He wants to go to the filler line after drying.
It is wrapped in a sweetened left into bags or glasses and is subjected to sterilisation.
Hame supplies oxygenated vegetables mainly to the foreign and Slovenian markets.
It is also reported in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a reporter from the U.S. news service, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to give the German Parliament evidence if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander would not be able to provide answers to questions about his activities.
German Ambassador Hans-Christian Střebele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, who delivered the media on Friday in Berlin, he said: "Although the results of my efforts have been provenly positive, the government continues to act as a fugitive and is trying to criminalise political demonstrations by serious complaints that do not give room for defence."
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government that it would be guilty of the crimes against it.
The accusations raised by the United States Ministry of Justice include spying and stealing of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
The tension between the United States and Germany began to rise when it was claimed that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of Parliament, who runs the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself at risk and completely destroying relations with the United States", this should be done.
Mr Střebele, the Parliament's MP on the German side of the Greens, published on his Twitter contribution a photo of Mr Snowden.
Two German journalists accompanied her on their way to Russia.
Mr. Strebele said that according to the former NSA attorney, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need assurance that he would be "safe", a member of Parliament said.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said that he faced a fierce and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the response of the whole world to his "political expression" added courage to him.
The general public and senior officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the detection of an unreasonable system of public service monitoring.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities "that the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved".
Killing us is sorry, but we're innocent. The Red Khmers are fighting.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Red Khmer hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
The governments of the Red Khmer, which opposed the mixture of Moses and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, have died as a result of extermination, hunger, disease, torture and correction of more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population then.
Tomuto, the commander of the notoriously pronounced prison S-21 awarded the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia a life sentence in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, embezzlement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan fought by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and not knowing what the real extent of the killing is.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and then hit and correct the situation," Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
You really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no power," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered the Red Khmer Cadets "to treat people badly or kill them to resist food or to taste genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" to be dead.
"I would like to apologize sincerely to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Red Khmer regime, told AFP that he could not accept the excuse of Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released from guilt."
"It's not about the second," she said.
"If he hadn't issued orders, his orders would not have killed," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmer are worse than a monster."
He was also supposed to be the "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Red Khmer regime Ieng Sary, who died this year in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012, the court examined an incapacitated process for dementia.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines will pay for manual baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to USD 100 for the storage of the handbag on board during its years.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 per handbag and USD 2 per cup of coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday they said that passengers would be able to leave the whole bottle.
The new fee for the manual luggage is for luggage in the upper spare space, so small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers with the payment wait until they arrive at the gate.
The spokesperson of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the cost of a hundredaire should be encouraged by the passenger to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would hate to choose this fee," she said.
The airlines started to apply the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and put them into handbags hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one way of teaching passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said the meaning of this new fee really isn't getting any more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most reliable customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top spare space is increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the company's website will not be paid.
This means that one passenger in front of Frontier's gate can bring a luggage for which he does not pay anything, while the other passenger in front for the same luggage will pay $100.
O'Malley said that websites and removal procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers will learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier fee for the handbag will not yet be valid until the summer, but the date has not yet been fixed.
Travelers often complain about luggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage is worth money, and passengers who demand this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider another charge for luggage as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of losses.
Most of them didn't agree with the fees for handbags.
Spirit Airlines was the first to apply the manual baggage three years ago and another low-cost company Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only company that also has such charges is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says the air traffic consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring additional charges.
In its December 2011 report, Spirit estimated that the fee for the manual luggage company would bring 50 million USD annually.
Sorensen, former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered about what he saw at the door when the passengers met with the unusual fee of Spirit for the manual luggage.
"The approach to the plane was the fastest I've ever seen in my aviation career," I said.
I've been waiting for the door to be able to see the binding of teeth and jaws.
The plane was full, he said, "and the show went into the brain".
Frontier also uses Spirit to pay for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said that passengers who get lemonade or juice can leave the whole bottle and the coffee will be added free of charge.
Water will continue to be given free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to introduce drinks charges, but after complaints from passengers seven months later, no other leading airline like it.
Frontier’s last move to pay the manual baggage if the passenger does not buy flights directly from this airline, its last attempt is to direct customers directly to its website.
Air carriers pay internet travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each air ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so through internet travel agencies.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who bought via the Internet travel agency only half a mile within the framework of the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the wages by 25 per cent of a mile from the road.
So the trip with Frontier is 1000 miles long purchased through the internet travel agency means 250 miles.
Customers also allow the company to choose its seat in advance only if they purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a faithful customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is starting to collapse and it is losing money.
According to the financial results of the mid-term business partner Republic Airways Holdings markets fell by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter
The company of Republic with the sale of this airline is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
He does not blame hackers for the fall of the NSA's website, but "internal error"
The secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its websites for several hours last week fell due to internal error, not because of the hackers' attack, as some said on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov pages were not available tonight for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during regular updates," the spy agency said in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the accident was caused by an attack by DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server recorders noted that NSA websites did not work for at least six hours, and sites are still unavailable for some users.
Previously, NSA spokesperson ABC News reported that internal sensitive networks of agencies were not "at all" threatened.
The speaker said no hidden information was in danger.
At least one group of online hackers claimed to be responsible for eradicating NSA sites through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood target web sites with information until the servers are intercepted and the site falls.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the meaning of attacks is not penetrated into the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, once named None of such an agency, became a result of the discovery of foreign and domestic monitoring programmes in recent months by the public attention and criticism of the overall product of removing NSA secret files from the agency and their expression by former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the Agency led to earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier’s profit was lost as a result of a decrease in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday a 15% reduction in net profits due to the lower number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and the contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier also published no data on the flight test for its new CSeries aircraft in Montreal, nor did it offer up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with the ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane only flew three times and raised the question of whether the test phase was doing well.
The results did not meet the estimates and the stock of the Toronto Stock Exchange decreased by 8 per cent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen reduced the rating on Thursday from "higher performance" to "sector performance" with the expectation that the stock exchange will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"As we expected most of the smaller shipments of aircraft, we were greatly disappointed by the distribution of profits in the transport sector," Doerksen told customers in the report.
As the pilot program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new CSeries flight orders.
However, if no new orders will be notified in the coming months, we assume that the market will grow towards this programme.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will enter the sub-area of the market, which now dominate Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March and after a few months of delay the first year was completed in September.
However, the number of mandatory orders of CSeries reaches a minimum of 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the pilot flight to be able to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and savings on the costs of this aircraft.
Currently, there are 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 mandatory orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The managers also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is being carried out in accordance with the plan.
"The pilot aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call and noted that the ground test and software update were planned during the flight's departure.
Every producer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate the first year and then focus on updating and we did.
That'll happen during the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of five test aircraft should fly in the coming weeks and shortly thereafter.
Analysts are skeptical, however, that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has assessed its plan of placing the aircraft on the market and will provide updated information in the following months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – although in line with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that entry into service will be moved to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
Of USD 172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier fell by 147 million in the third quarter of September 30th, or 8 cents per share.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged for 9 cents.
Turnout has decreased marginally from USD 4.2 billion to USD 4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that, unlike 57 aircraft a year earlier, only 45 aircraft were added during that quarter.
Clear orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The non-compliances in the aviation division amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, which does not change until 31 December.
"The results of the flight were in line with our prospects, but the low revenue of the orders and the overall market situation disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
The output in the aviation industry fell by 13 per cent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, said that the output in this division grew by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
Infringements in transport amounted to 32.6 billion on 30 September, which is against 31 December.
The distribution of revenues in the transport division has been affected by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The managers indicated that new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, who also announced the revenue of the financial director of Google Patrick Pichettea, decreased by 8.5 per cent on Thursday afternoon at $4.83.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, announced on Thursday a 10 per cent loss in the quarterly profit.
The law on cocaine that warned the mafia before the police investigation is in prison
Bashart Ditta (42) was to transmit information to King Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A peak advocate who informed the drug mob about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
After Bashart Ditta (42) became a suspect in the use of cocaine, the head of the sub-world Neil Scarbrough had to provide sensitive information on the investigation of his drug addiction activities.
The lawyer, whose surname was "Bash" (party), who was criminally celebrated as the best legal representative, was arrested at home in 2011.
The police observed Sarborough (32), leaving three cocaine bags at the lawhouse in Blackburn in Lancashire, which was at dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests where cocaine was found in his hair, his money and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Detta was a regular drug user of Class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he sought information on the arrest of two men in the benefit of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were monitored during the major investigation of heroin and cocaine trafficking in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police held heroin and cocaine in a series of attacks of approximately GBP 1.5 million together with GBP 200,000 in cash, 32 more people were killed in prison with them.
Ditta (42) gave information to the criminals because he feared that his addiction to cocaine would occur.
Today, Ditta, who works with Forbes Solicitors legal firm in Blackburn, was sentenced to a three-week trial by the Liverpool Crown Court for being found guilty of defending justice in two cases.
During his previous hearing, he admitted to holding cocaine.
The lawyer's fall occurred after a police investigation of Scarborough found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two suspects were following him, recording his arrival at Ditt's house, and watching him put 60 percent of the drugs in the black golf glove.
Next, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular phone conversation.
The lawyer came home where he found the drugs, and nine conversations took place between the two.
The court found that Class A drugs were in his hair, money and credit cards and that Detta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but he denied the use of cocaine, and said that he was talking to a suspect dealer because he was his client, and argued that their conversation falls into "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but all were detained and his hair samples were taken.
At the police hearing, he said he was operating the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that his clients were visiting him at home for work.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted significant players in the drug supply chain, some of which he had previously represented to inform them of what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is aware that he must not violate the law than the law representative in the criminal field.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the regular relationship of a client lawyer.
The police investigation was dreaming as much as possible to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, but he insulted her.
With some of his clients he got too close, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused and declared: “If I were a corrupt lawyer I wasn’t, and I wanted to report information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would have done it right away.”
However, after hearing the police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said: “Mr. Detta became a criminal himself from a law representative in the criminal field at the time he started to get drugs from organised criminals.”
Its dependence on cocaine has made it hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organised crime groups who were tasked with collecting valuable information on police investigation.
Legal representatives must abide by the highest principles of integrity and must in public inspire confidence and feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the trap of his profession.
The unit for serious and organised crime in Lancashire has led against Mr. Ditt's investigation, on the basis of which he was also sentenced to three cases of cocaine detention and now to prevent the execution of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the criminal to justice.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and set you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of collaborating for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for 153 years for drug offences.
On his website Ditta arranged an online conversation about himself, saying that his dreamed work would be legally representing clients from the death block in America as guests at dinner would want Mohammed Ali and as motivation for work would indicate inequality.
He was negotiating a government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasala sent against Babish.
In the elections, the people received fourteen MPs, i.e. only a third of the number of social Democrats or representatives of the United Nations.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to guess the descriptions of possible coalitions, Jan Kasala has a man who made the conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Social Democrats and Andrej Babish don't have such a mattress on their side.
This will probably remind you of the first negotiations in 1992 when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"Experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press challenged by controversial media law
"It is a terrible report and it is on the spot to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply preventing the independence of the judiciary from tomorrow," the newspaper quoted the draft law as anti-constitutional.
"This law is harsh and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most renowned independent broadcasting stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be preoccupied because it is an extended government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Keni's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to Star magazine, the bill actually transmits "full control of the media" to the government, and Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "stirred a hard wound", and criticises the bill as "pretty".
The adoption of the draft law comes through a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by the Islamic shooter at the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The anger of the Kenyan authorities turned to the media when it sent a security camera to which the troops allegedly needed luxury goods.
The police director responded that he had two journalists and a leading media employee called for an interview, but the call was delayed after the press pressure.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be tortured by up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings and individual journalists up to one million together with the risk of "exclusion from the list" or can be denied official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to entertain the property of the creditor if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “there is also one incentive to eliminate most of the radio stations.”
It is also noted that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that when they shut up the media, they can do with impunity what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote the journalist of Nation Mutuma Mathia and described Kenyan media as the key source of the system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"When we leave it on the politicians, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of around 532,000 untaxed shillings each month, which is the highest in the world.
It's got to fight, young Czechs know.
Most of them don't even know what interest
More and more Czechs give their money to the side.
However, they don't fit the champions in the region.
Most of the money on the side is stored by the Rakustans, who charge an average of 181 euros a month.
About something more than the Czechs are pumping people into Slovakia.
It comes from a study by Erste Savings Barometer in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the mediators is improving and two thirds of the respondents are planning to give themselves more money.
While the Czechs are almost in the middle of the middle of the Mediterranean, people in Romania and Serbia are still using very little.
For example, almost every other Serb comes home "under the pillow" according to the survey.
In the country this year, the number of those who are lowering monthly amounts increased.
Last year, every month, thousands to 2.5 thousand crowns of 26 per cent of respondents to the most diverse type of bonding, this year it's five per cent more.
The average monthly figure in the interim comparison fell slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among the booster products is pension insurance.
This accounts for 54 per cent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to assess savings for only 36 per cent of people.
On the contrary, the structure of the construction project is declining, as was the case last year, and the interest of the investment funds has also fallen significantly.
You're only using 16 percent of the respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The study also showed that while people consider it important to burn, most of them do not know the results of individual products.
Especially young people under 30 don't know how their money is earned.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best knowledge of the results of their savings, and 73 per cent of those over the age of 50 know that.
In the international comparison of the Erste Česchi group, they lead online banking, which regularly uses 44% of people.
The following are the Slovaks and the Rakustans with a 12% discount.
UN celebrates the new goals of combating poverty
The United Nations is immediately working on a new set of objectives that replaces the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the launch of the "sustainable development goals" to replace MDGs, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr. Ki-mun said over the night at the summit that now is the time to "take a stand for national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process, which is to establish the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDG will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I am making every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision of the goals of sustainable development that are building on the success of the MDG.
Mozambique's security concerns are escalating due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under Samory Machely, the founder's Mosambian president, thousands of people met in the center of Maputa to express their peaceful passwords in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Out of fear of the future of her country, the company changed its clothes for a shirt decorated with the inscription "require security" in Portuguese and joined the site of independence in the capital on Thursday.
After two weeks, reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, of one of the worst flows from the peace agreement more than 20 years ago, have been reported almost daily.
Renamo was once a notoriously well-known uprising, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt again in the country, but recent events have prompted foreign investors and locals.
There is a fast-growing economy because the findings of large coastal reserves of oil and carbon deposits in the northwest can bring investment worth more than $50 billion from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and USA's Anadark over the next few years.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo each other are accused of the resulting tension.
On 17 September, Renamo claimed that the government had triggered the last conflicts by initiating an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional town of Renamo.
The violent attack of former rebels was subsequently carried out when government forces attacked the base of Renamo and tried to kill Afons Dhaka, the leader of the group, told the Financial Times spokespersons of Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government is accusing of launching Renamo's conflicts because it was attacked by soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to alleviate the fears of instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a "scrupulous" who wanted to use "what remained of his strength to try to prove that the government could direct its own decision".
Like Frelimo, Renamo claims they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew when Mr. Mazangy’s words were quoted as saying that the Renamo party withdrew from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT letter said it meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to a conversation, but with seriousness," said Mr Mazanga.
The previous discussions between these parties have been made to calm tensions between these parties, which have been disrupted by a number of flows this year, just a few.
It is a charm between the two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Not one of them is a good negotiator, and not one of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought to change the elections, has already expressed itself that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an attempt to mitigate the movement to gain from the government’s advantage and financial gain.
The electoral share of Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the newest party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza, whose second functional period ends next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"The democratic system does not want more sides, does not want transparent elections, does not want peace, because it does not want to leave the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but he has carried out vicious terrorist attacks on the police station and on vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most of the shipments came to Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometres away from Maputo, but where Beira is a port on which labor companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on when they export coal.
In June, Rio stopped for about a week of use of the railway when Renamo threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to express himself on the question of whether Renamo was repeating his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent flood of abortions.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies exclusively with the government and the president, and that he should be the one who will find a solution to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to the road," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models for the way of life", says the author.
Thor’s stories may show that “hard force cannot be equaled by intelligent beings”, while artushov’s legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of myths would "be too wild for school education, too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscenistic," said Crossley-Holland, who is committed to the careful choice of age.
"I think it's great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been planning this plan for twenty years.
He added that "open-teachers" authors and teachers are in the wake of a "student" message for children as "student".
Crossley-Holland, who translated from English Bishop Beowulf and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Babies, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you leave them for yourself.”
Probably the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended by a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through history, not openly defined.
The old truth is it's better to show than to describe.
Brno's star takes visitors to the universe in a new digital
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last half of the year.
There is a new show here, visitors can dive into new comfortable seats and above their heads came a projection area of an average of 17 meters in the form of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To be a perfect picture, there are other smaller projectors around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the roof of the hall.
"It's twenty-one computers that generate images," said the director of the Brinish starry Jiří Dušek.
Computers will make sure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a good impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty times as much as 40 times higher than that of classical personal computers," said the technology from the starry Tomáš Hladík.
Digitarium can explore an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers are so enchanted right in the middle of the universe or man's brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the starroom plans to predict purchased order and its own creation in the hall.
There's been two rounds since Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly into space, get stuck in the centrifuge, and then see how difficult conditions are for astronauts in the face of space.
The second show is for children and it's called Magic Utes - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of the ostrich whose petro-colored inhabitants lived in a peaceful life until the outbreak of a nearby drought.
The entire digitalium was worth about fifty million crowns, which were paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the constellation from its budget also contributed by small amounts.
The projection area was ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest of the audio-visual technology and computers collapsed," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the star went through two years ago.
According to the director of Duška, between 25 and 30 thousand visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We were studying 11 THlS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis caught more than 11,000 job-seekers, 4300 of whom were published in the daily press and 6800 jobs (62%) on the Internet.
The Internet thus becomes the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the study was first carried out, it accounted for 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), approximately 60 per cent were established.
The advertising of job opportunities in themselves, according to the analysis, is a significant reflection of the current situation on the labour market.
For example, a simple comparison can be made between the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and during the time of the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25 900 ads were published in the same monitored period, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is targeted at the narrower, especially a more qualified group of professionals.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those working, according to the author of the analysis, Pavlín Šłastnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the front seats of advertisements sought by managers and managers, trade representatives, programmers and financial experts were interested.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In today’s press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, but the high level of representation is particularly useful and professional.
Of course, the most frequently stated requirements expressed by employers through an advertising offer are education.
Other areas were the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, a requirement for the knowledge of a foreign language was made in three percent of ads, on the internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of the ads did employers demand an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' occurred in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertising.
Practice requirements are all linked to qualified professionals.
It's particularly about leading production and other leading workers.
In particular, in the case of workshop professionals, the author of the study Jiří Tillner complemented the mechanics and repairers or the manufacturer and processor of food products or the repairers of electrical appliances.
Employers shall also specify in the half of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential beneficiaries.
As the most often required skills in the first place, communication skills have been revealed in the advertisement for a long time.
Employers also require flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, accountability, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New Yorker Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where a solo comedy show was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, various artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the assembled people jokes using the method of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty performances in small clubs and big theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the point that they are too big than to play at the club," Hirschová said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performance of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes", each year's musical comedy performance in Madison Square Garden, on which Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will perform.
Just as this festival expanded, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians attended this year's festival took off from non-traditional channels such as the show in smaller advertising or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has developed his own comedy show at the Comedy Central station with a fantastic football theme on FXX.
Jenny Slate was a member of the "Saturday night live" program, the "Parks and recreation", but she was the fastest to celebrate with the growing series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on" (Museum Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, greedy, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of a decentralised American comedy world.
One of the biggest taps of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he organized a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting is held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he goes through a street between two buildings and he says, "Man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here."
The oil price went down to $96 per barrel
The oil price on Friday continued to decrease as concerns about high stocks were weighted by the report, which showed the strengthening of the Chinese production sector of lacquer by energy.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel during the late morning in European electronic commerce at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, he was down 39 cents, and for the month of October, he remained 5.8%.
The rich stocks of oil in recent weeks have made the price difficult.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that US resources have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production led to a larger demand that showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to grow by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of the previous two weak decades.
Oil Brent, an international oil indicator also used by American refineries, fell at the International Trade Exchange in London by 26 cents for $108.58 per barrel.
Not at all, Mr. Hasku.
We have a unique opportunity to show politicians that they don't.
It is necessary to develop such pressure to rid Martin Hasek of all political functions and leave the mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so flawed.
Martin Hasek is protected by the promise he has made, but everyone and politics in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babis also has the important one, but it is the question whether they are politics).
The better program pursued by a liar is unbelievable.
There's no excuse in politics, there's no way in politics.
Mr. Hashk, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements determine me in it, if you did not - here you see how it is difficult to lie), you will leave politics alone as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and is responsible for her.
Otherwise, you will be viewed as helpless weak, unable to believe words or deeds.
Whether you want to be proud or a missing person or a lifesaver.
It may seem to you that he is unfair when I address you only, but you are a leader and they are only a lost sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to close your ears, reassess your strength, cut the crap out and then attack again, but that's how Partisans or subversives behave.
You're, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court of Justice has blocked the regulation on the procedure for the arrest and search of persons by the NY police department
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the judicial regulation requiring changes in the arrest and search programme for persons in the New York Police Department and dismissed the case.
The second U.S. appeal by the Federal Court said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be postponed until the decision on the appeal by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city violated the Constitution by carrying out its programme of stopping and questioning people.
The city of her conclusion and her regulation of correction had been attacked, including the decision to grant supervision, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Board of Appeal heard arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be dismissed in the event of a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, and that as a judge it did not act on the requirement to avoid the opinion of the company, in part due to a series of media discussions and a public statement which it openly reacted to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics in their program to stop and search people.
It established independent surveillance to monitor major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme for the purpose of testing cameras carried on the body in some areas where the most frequent arrest occurs.
In August, New York agreed to terminate the method of storing names and addresses of people whose cases were refused after the police search.
The oral reasons for the city's withdrawal are sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching persons have criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
In a certain form there has been a halt and search of persons for some decades, but the surveyes under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to the record number 684 330 in 2011, in most cases black and Spanish.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to a minority, wrote a complaint which became a case for a group complaint.
The reform advocates of the arrest and search programme by the NY police department claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police body and may affect how these procedures are used by another police department.
The opponents claim that the changes reduce police morality, but not crime, and that money is being wasted, but they do not solve a wider problem when the police are under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by a few thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not completed the practice of stopping and searching for persons who were constitutional, but reformed the way the police department’s visit to the NY had introduced.
Five shopping malls meet with low visits
It comes from the data of real advice companies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In the Prague Bohnicas the public is opened The Krakov Shopping Centre will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
In the Czech Republic, there are now a total of 90 large shopping centres.
Dissatisfaction is about 20 percent of the average large and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large center towards the locality and the wrong layout, so too much floor or complicated and opaque layout of the passports, possibly the dead places of the center," said Michal Sotak of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the leading retail property department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, there are about five shopping centers with low visits.
Among the main reasons are poor transport availability, low income categories of local residents or market resuscitation in the given place.
Some projects opened almost fully, but their results were largely unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their purchasing habits.
The new shopping centres need to try harder to 'lock' their customers into new brands on the market, entertainment, services and marketing," Samadi added.
The volume of shopping centres is generally stable according to Sotáka, even at some centres, because the tenants were willing to withdraw from the rent and hire some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully contained and that the average content is reduced in this way (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Shantovka in Olomouci)," Soták added.
Trade centres opened in the last two years are being marketed in accordance with Sylvie Samadi very slowly.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for building a project that would serve the people of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinence centres', aimed at the purchase and services of daily needs for residents living in the immediate environment," Samadi said.
According to Sotáka, there is also a place on the foreign market for other shopping centres.
And both for small 'service' centres, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, Czech Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague he sees the space for the prepared shopping centre at the Victory Square, and according to him, they have clear street potential for Na Příkopá and Václavský square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developed, allowing traders to cover and expand into ever smaller cities at favourable rental and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, and their reconstruction, for example, the reconstruction of business houses Prior, which is of good locality," Dita Kubánkova from DTZ added.
In the Czech Republic, 90 modern shopping centres with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of land are currently located.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, from Incoma GfK data.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is on average EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, with the Czech Republic staying about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson got on the phone to check the tip.
The former editor of news News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods "to get on the phone, monitor and confront", to confirm the deceptive tip of a loving relationship to which the then Minister of Interior Charles Clarke was to be involved.
State representative Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey court said that the news of the World caught a false report in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The news entrusted private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to get into Pawlby's voice box and penetrated her privacy, but the court said Coulson had called her and left her voice messages.
"The State Representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing in front of the house and hoping that people are trapped outside, but a person who likes to tell stories to see what they say," said Edis.
He said that NotW newspapers used three ways to explore stories: getting into the phone, watching and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the second one, watching, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about getting stuck in the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he does."
The women about the loving relationship that Clarke is involved were first caught by the NotW News Department when the source, who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby, was said, "You're wasting your time, that's Charles."
A record of the voice reports received from her phone on at least three occasions was received at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records in the computer of the private investigator where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were named "Projects".
During the time that Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her parents received anonymous phone calls requesting information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur, Neville Thurlbeck, and former rapporteur, James Weatherup, were watching Mrs Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, saying: “I got a story that we are going to publish tomorrow and which I would like to talk to Charles very much about.”
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same pattern as in other important characters, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, it was announced that Coulson was confronting Mr. Blunkett for his loving relationship with the married woman, while he himself was seeing the co-indicted Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks objected to contact others for calls between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup agreed to get on the phone.
The detection of NSA increases the public awareness of state monitoring
One day in the late hours of August, the German police helicopter was pushing over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
The purpose of the mission was to arrange photographs of the top U.S. pre-supposed surveillance, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank, to the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV).
The German media claims that the BfV Office hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action led to an exchange of views between the US and German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again claimed in September that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies and thus enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker as an informer, has begun to discover his valuable collection from the United States, European governments and leading entrepreneurs no longer know if they should believe the words of the director.
According to reports that the US National Security Agency has conducted spying in the Brazilian oil company and has gained access to the data available by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, has achieved a general paranoia on state monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop revealed that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel was probably listened to for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly the potential target and the front entrepreneurs.
Snowden reviewed intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY Advisory Service, German companies are convinced that with regard to industrial espionage and data theft, the US is now at the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence that the United States has transferred the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies in the whole of the file revealed by Mr Snowden.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU was lacking certain IT and Internet capabilities and stated that efforts should be made to limit its dependence on the US:
The leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
The German Parliament calls on us to produce a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German SAP software company.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany comes from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The extent and technical propriety of American spy agencies discovered by Snowden is shocking for some companies that have so far thought that the greatest threat from monitoring is China, however.
There is a large turnaround in cloud computing techniques, where European representatives have become more aware that data stored in the United States fall under that jurisdiction and are therefore potentially attackable.
According to a survey carried out by the business community Cloud security alliance about 10 per cent of non-American members after the discovery of the US Prism data-sharing programme cancelled the plans to use a cloud provider based in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP's CEOs, says: "We have this new question for customers that were not here a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German high-level actors argue that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to deny their most valuable secrets and this data must be protected at any price.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is not surprising.
It's always been.
"It has been a key topic for many years and has not changed significantly during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Director General of the Agrochemicals Company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial levels, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
The company leaders generally do not want to boast about the countermeasures that they have taken to prevent the attacker from benefiting.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB drive or leaving an unprotected notebook in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi's car representation, says that it has been a practice for many years to gather before the mobile phone representation meeting so that it can not be used as a listening device.
The German Office of BfV's head of staff advises them to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones abroad due to the risk that smart phones can be denied.
Prepaid mobile phones will then be released.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading global markets in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access," the BfV report warns.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post US National Intelligence Estimate, France was introduced in February next to Russia and Israel in the second row of sponsors involved in the hacker activity for economic reporting, which is right behind China.
A member of the Council in the German risk-free society concluded that, as far as economic espionage is concerned, "they are the worst French".
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal news agency DCRI, said this month in one of the talks: "The services know very well that all countries, even when working together in the fight against terrorism, are engaged in spying on their allies."
Parents of an unaccompanied Georgian boy who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of an unaccompanied boy from Georgia whose body was found inside the distraught combat spirits in his high school gym believe that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a spirit of balance behind the gymnasiums of the high school where he went.
The sheriff's investigators from Downdes County concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old refuses.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said lawyer Benjamin Crump for FoxNews.com, representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and also healthy sense," Crump said.
They feel that it should cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, their son was sent to school and he came back to ask for dead people," he said.
State representative Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unresponsible.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Moore said at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll keep an eye on the fact that they're telling me anywhere.
My goal is to find the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for regular investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original drink indicated that Johnson had died as a result of "suffering".
The second drink, however, according to Moore, introduced another cause of death.
"There are several questionnaires that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that in the case of Johnson's death, if he reveals enough evidence for an order to investigate a crime or violation of civil rights, he would request the FBI and its implementation.
The representative of the sheriff's office in the district of Lownedes was not immediately available for a comment on Thursday.
The judge from southern Georgia ordered the authorities to make available all the videos from the surveillance cameras that the investigators have examined.
A youth’s parents hope that the videos will contain a clue to how their son died.
CDC Centre issued guidelines for children's allergy
At the centre of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), a file of guidelines was issued to help children with food allergies in school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government, which is due to the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergy.
One of the 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC Centre found that food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide for schools with information on how to inform the teachers and staff about child food allergies and how to react to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline – the most frequently used automatic injector of EpiPen – to be able to react to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State law authorities have recently updated the rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children who have allergic reactions.
The child can say, "It's like somebody's staring at my tongue," "I feel like I'm having a hairy tongue" or "Bearing my tongue."
Parents of Intersexual Children can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with an indistinguishable gender arrangement.
Newborn children will no longer be classified either as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to introduce any gender for such children and allows them to identify gender as "unspecified" or "unspecified" on their family lists.
The purpose of the law is to stop pressure on parents so that their child will suddenly decide for the operation for the purpose of determining sex and to fight against discrimination against those who are intersexual.
A BBC intersexual person after many years said, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to stay a slatanine-made doctor, deformed and detected.
It is estimated that every year 2000 children will be born one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
There are intersex, part of the group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of sexual development disorder, disrupting the term for those with atypical chromosomes, sexual jaundice (anger or vertebrate) or unusually developed genitalia.
The intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender identification is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if sex cannot be identified, it is better to use the best available information and identify it instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is carried out, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-specific issues, said that the new German law "looks like a good thing".
Intersexual children are ethical dilemmas.
"Some people are life-threatening, which requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
The definition of sex can be carried out without surgery and can then wait for the development of identity.
The knowledge of how sexuality develops in children is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not related to sex, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These images may occur in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bloating and character, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination enjoyed by inter-sexual and trans-sexual people in the field of work, as well as the level of burden, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit in with any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to be identified in official documents of male, female or "third sex".
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first "unsexual" person in June when she won the appeal so that she could leave the status of "uncertain" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, there will be German passports other than M (husband) and F (wife) and third name, X, for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, according to the report on France, 24 gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this highly Catholic country signed petitions to remove “sex theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic website online has also been defined against the German law and wrote: “With the world being drawn to a new state, when sex is a question of choice, but sexual activity, we are not turning the lines of two other pillars of civilization.”
A mother born from Maryland also said about the Baby Zone that she would rather see children have sex when they were born.
"The parenthood alone is stressful even without other restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said to the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to a prominent river that had two sexes.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a table that could be sewn up and crossed again.
But now many doubt the ethical basis of the operation that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes decide wrong because they do not know how their sex will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
Persistent theory of how to treat children with a gender mismatch was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that social causes and the environment – as their parents raised their child – influenced the genes and hormones of children and created a child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theory became controversial.
The parents of the boy whose penis was damaged by the wrong cut, recommended that their child be completely evicted, removed, and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of change, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he was allowed to return to the boy and marry his wife.
But in 38 years, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these operations became "unsatisfaction with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but an inconspicuous sexual device.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he would never live a "satisfying life".
And so soon after his birth in 1976 Bruce was surgically removed from the external organs and vertebrates and was raised as a girl.
He got female hormones in 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," said ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
In 18 he was sent to a plastic sink.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After I was born, I was sterilized and nobody ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (SDD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its sexual organs.
After learning the truth, he turned back to the man, took the testosterone doses, and let himself remove the dust,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in the organisation called Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Legal Group Advocates for informed choice (representatives of informed elections) living in California, is afraid that the German law "calls for tea and stigmats".
“Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose for the child “uncertain”, she said.
We're afraid he's gonna blow it up for intervention.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decision on the legal sex," she said.
The German law is going to grant it at birth.
It's a battle that a little child shouldn't be carrying on right now.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast nurse who has a daughter with sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "gives authority" to both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen-insensitive syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are bad, Katie's female drawings developed.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a job and eggs.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married, and she works as an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents some space so they don't rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to carry out certain tests and to think about it and gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful baby and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush with an operation that's irrevocable.
"It gives the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and to take away the anxiety that parents are bound by, because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he or she identifies more – and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk ate the whole house of gas: he threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension rose, the fear rose.
The man started threatening to burn the whole house.
Instead, all available police surveillance in the area, as well as a unit of firemen from Mladé Boleslavi and a group of voluntary firemen, took place.
There was also a police consultant who tried to speak up about his irrational behavior.
The man kept threatening to burn the house.
That's how she had to get into the house an intruder that damaged and bound the men.
The aggressor then ended his investigation at a juvenile hospital, where he was transferred to an alcohol detention facility.
Finally, the Hassicians slept in the house with petrol sorbents, which they later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house.
He didn't give a man to the police negotiator, so he got the command.
News: Obama's campaign was considering exchanging Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisor, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton in 2012.
This discovery is the most important sensational book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemanna "Double down: Game Change 2012".
The Times magazine received a copy of the upcoming books and announced on Thursday evening that the presidents of the summit co-workers had organized an intensive group meeting and research at the end of 2011, to assess whether Bidena's release would help revive Obama's lightninging hope of the re-election.
According to the National-Policy Journalist for the Times, Jonathan Martina, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of leading officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head of Bill Daley's White House, to measure what impact the move would have on elections by former foreign ministers will have on Clinton's post as vice president.
The potential change was closely monitored by the secret within the Chicago infrastructure campaign and within the Oval Works.
Only a few of the closest presidential advisers – including Daley, former head of Obama’s campaign Jim Messin and former chief advisers at the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was the representative of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that until they finally decided not to make this move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would "not significantly increase Obama's chances".
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering Biden Clinton's replacement.
"I've examined a whole series of things intensively, and this was one of them," said Daley's letter.
You must not forget that the president had a terrible vision at the time, so we said, "Christian, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "appropriate care", Martin told Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign for the re-election had made a lot of investments to see if this move would be paid out in elections.
"The campaigns do not make such money for elections and qualitative research if something is not really considered," Martin said to AC360.
It is not clear, though, whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about this potential car crash.
While Daley said he didn't think that the president was "conscious" of the potential changes, the former head office admitted that he was "possible", that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama at the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama didn't know about the investigation of Biden's expulsion from the candidate.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British businessman produced the first ice-cream that shines in the dark – for the use of medusa.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a light-emitting palm tree.
He came up with the idea when he read the specialized media deal, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce protein that causes light to light.
This freeze reacts with the language of the consumption – increases the pH in the protein and then causes its exposure.
Chris says the ice is shining when he reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and that's why the more you lie down, the brighter the snow.
Charlie, the founder of the ice-cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (sweet me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but as far as production is concerned, we're at the beginning, so you'll get about 2 g of this substance for GBP 200."
The protein we use in the freezer reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH increases and the ice starts to shine.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween's celebration because it's causing this fantastic glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream that I've ever made, because the light beaming of honey is four times more expensive than gold.
And that's how every hill is worth about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company in Bristol is known for its non-traditional taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold notes.
His next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I would really like to make an invisible ice cream."
In fact, it's impossible because of the fragment of the ice crystal caused by the ice that I make, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of honey, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By number
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
We were able to eat sweets with our sister, stay up for a long time, and present ourselves to our neighbors in the dressing room.
Today, I feel like I've become a caretaker.
Two years later, there was no sugar in my apartment, and this year it probably won't be different.
However, statistics show that I am black sheep in Halloween.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will celebrate most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations.
But what I'm looking forward to every Halloween thing is trends.
According to the NRF, it is expected that 1.2 billion dollars of lost dollars will go to costumes.
This year is the last time in fashion sexy non-living objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; sexy can be like pizza, hamburger and carrot.
As far as men are concerned, I expect us to see a lot of zombies through the dead, and I bet that the spacemen from Daft Punk will pull it into our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and we weren't the only ones in my outfit.
In fact, according to the NRF, the American spends $330 million on pet costumes this year.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As far as sweetness is concerned, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen U.S. company, $1.9 billion is lost.
It's about 300 million pounds of Hershey's table, herring, sweet milk duds and Twizzlers and Clark.
This is an amazing report for 41 million fellows who, according to the U.S. Department of Trade, are about to break our neighborhood.
Actually, we're going to buy it during Halloween, and believe it or not, we're going to consume 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn beans, and yet, according to the National Association, sugarcane around Halloween sells almost 16,000 tons.
That's about 9 billion individual corn beans.
It's a secret I've never solved.
There's nothing more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names such as "Terror behind the walls" and "The house of shock" (House of shock).
In fact, there are in the United States officially dedicated 1200 horrific homes that, according to the American Horror House, earn $500 million, and this includes the amazing photos on which you are horrified and which give your friend on Facebook, and you can't remove them and the person you like will view the photo and write a comment as "beautiful faces".
And finally, there's little about shadows.
As soon as we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a great dynamism (Great Pumpkin) and cutting the dynamism lamp is something like an improvement in the Christmas tree – we do it from a little.
Luckily for us the trend "child in dyna" started with the Pinterest application only last year, so most of us grew up to cut the stick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. People's Accounting Office, U.S. is losing about 106 million dollars.
The diner with a soft spot on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245,000 tons of foam grew.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa in California and try to cut off their dyna weighing almost one tonne.
Announced race series Land Rover
The interior has race seats and six-point safety belts as well as intercom equipment.
The choice includes perfect brakes, service packs ensuring access to Bowler Works machines, logistics support and vehicle storage between individual races.
Drew Bowler, technical director Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants in the races that come to Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an affordable way to the world class races.
We are pleased to offer them this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way of enjoying various race disciplines in Britain and abroad, and that it will prepare competitors for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid.
The development of the Defender Challenge car we have really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February as well as an opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: Two years ago we have an early election
The president of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is looking forward to further early elections.
The week after those last talks for Aktuální.cz said that there is no other east and every government is sending out of voting last Friday and Saturday is impossible blind.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, saying that the life span of the beginning of the election period is estimated to be within two years.
With the objection that the next voter complains of choosing completely different, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not allow his party to lose the voters in other elections as this year (by 2010 there were about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that early elections will take place, it will boost the movement of the UN 2011 Andreje Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The Turbulent situation in ČSSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secreted Lansing meeting of the party leadership, declared that in the leadership of social democracy, either he or Michal Hasek, would remain commenting on Schwarzenberg:
"The leading officials of the democratic party as small boys go to the head of the state to allow them to be converted into the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I haven't seen anything so rude in my life," said TOP president 09.
And towards President Zeman (who met in the fight against the presidential function), he said: "The role of the state head is clear: He wants to strengthen the party."
The first laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was the personal surprise of the elections?
TOP 09 has formally submitted its first draft laws, including the Paris Register of Contracts which had been discussed by the Snow Committees before the elections, but with the early elections he fell under the table.
President TOP 09 in the discussion for Current.cz argues that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, the TOP 09 clearly wants to anticipate similar attempts on the other side.
For example, ANO electoral leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of the idea of establishing a register of the "defeating" movement program of the UN.
TOP 09 now took advantage of the jump - it just blew up the proposal that had already been advanced to second reading.
The Hassician units came to save the lost dog, which hung 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in the quarry
Ruby's little car crashing away.
Three days later, the man who was imprisoned in the tomb saw the man who had buried the dog.
The Hassians jumped across the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The wall was liberated by fire units that came to release it after it was somehow stuck to a dangerous mine in a 15 - foot - above - ground stone.
Nine months later, Ruby ran off after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived for three days himself until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the tombstone Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he fled when he got into a small accident, hotly after his lost dog, they searched and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, about 14.15, a pale-eyed dog caught Ruby hanging on a cliff 15 meters above the ground.
Instead, he rushed a technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station and jumped down to free Ruby, using him to pick up a transport bag for the animals.
Andy Clayton, an expert commander of the technical rescue team, said: Dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
At the rescue, he did not move the brew – he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got the towels.
It was a very unusual departure.
The fact that a dog has been seen is incredible.
The technical rescue team chief Peter Lau said: “Ruby had great happiness during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet at the check-in, and besides exhausting and dehydration, he was okay.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "When I looked at the rescue action, I was afraid."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
The Hassians have done a great job.
What they did was very bold.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The hats were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry didn't make it.
During an interview with the Australian broadcaster this week, this pop star said that for Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004 she sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
She added: "It has been a long time, and now it is very nice to me."
In a statement on Thursday, Jagger's (70) representative said he would categorically refuse to make Katy Perry's proposals.
The representative said, "Maybe you're messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the host singers (singers) who appeared this year on the Rolling Stones concert track.
Her new album "Prism" started this week in the first place.
George Kerevan: Split Europe Gives Scotts a Choice
Next day, another horrible story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This led to the stories of passport checks in Berwick and the rest of the line along Hadrian's wave.
The truth is that Strathclyde's newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – the headlines did not mean it.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they so agree.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continuing dissatisfaction would be a cheap discount for Brussels for anything that the Scottish people really want.
So it's a pretty bad story.
And also so old that it became an exhumation. I heard from the press that "independence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
However, there's one interesting idea hidden in this velvet story.
Why should independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why exchange London for Brussels, especially now?
This is a real European story: a great war plan to bring Europe together has finally come to an end.
The impact of the euro crisis is so-called Project Europe officially dead.
On the other hand, Europe is being influenced by a party dedicated to resistance to the EU or by the abolition of the euro as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany – founded this year – came as if nowhere and has already used almost five million votes in the September federal elections, which from the Bundestag essentially "discharges" Free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats).
On the home floor, there was always a resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The differences dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a commitment to the national economy through the single currency, have led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments having a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, southern Europe has an advantage in the area of domestic production against Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public expenditure – which Germany is offering.
In the face of current budgetary and monetary problems, Europe's small performance is a deeper cause.
As a result of the 'green' energy policy supported by Brussels – the code for support for French and German companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol than it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing expense disadvantage, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even any global freeze of wages would not reverse the sinking of the European petrochemical industry with the US's cheap pedigree oil.
As a result, there is a growing rebellion, especially in France, when the EU is excited.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that will keep Germany on track and allow Paris to stand at Washington level in the world.
Berlin, however, does not need Paris as a sign of political legitimacy and has prosecuted its own economic policy in Europe and has left behind its fate the French economy in need.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, just won the main additional elections and withdrew the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now with 24% of the most popular part in France – a timely warning for British Labourers that they cannot consider that the right-wing is automatically positive on the left.
How does Le Pen’s newly acquired popularity among the white working class come about?
The next year's European elections would like to take advantage of the European Parliament's setting up an anti-European anti-money bloc.
If anti-European parties act well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can be dominated for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
At the same time, I think that the growing anti-European feeling and attitude towards the common currency will be linked and the euro will be lost.
The EU is not disappearing, but the transformation is more of a "European (Sovereign) nation" rather than a "general de Gaulle".
Germany and several of its satellite economies may leave the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where's Scotland?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – it is also possible to announce to Berlin and Brussels when we are to be left behind.
I assume that Scotland would be good at keeping its own currency in a free Europe.
Cooperation with other similar countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise we should take an example from Norway and leave our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland – the most successful political movement – is the unscrupulous economic action in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 due to its opposition to the strikes planned (and implemented) by the Labour Office of Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland were now to choose independence simply to take the economic measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Temporary Puberty: Adults in the Past
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics get puberty before their whites.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it
Experts claim that an epidemic of obesity may be one of the most recent pubertys.
The trend of early puberty isn't that good for boys.
Former CNN Rapporteur Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family problems.
Should a mother be afraid when her daughters begin to grow breast and breast-feeding at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Doctors this week in Orlando in Florida, pediatrician endocrinologist Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time making sure my parents that it was not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kalowitz said.
The visible signs of development, such as breast growth, abstinence on the back and in the underpants and body breath, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift in age when the first menstrual period occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared with the age of 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, it will grow for at least two to three years before the first menstrual period," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem"
The most reliable test of how puberty continues is time.
It is discussed about what activates the actual beginning of puberty, but if growth is accompanied by growth spores 8 years ago, the girl is considered to be "precisely mature".
In most cases, the process will be slowed down or stopped – which children’s doctors can monitor closely.
Faster growth may be a reason for endocrinologist to carry out tests to eliminate serious problems such as cancer or cyst.
There are medical procedures that delay early menstrual periods and prohibit further consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and agility in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding medicines and hormonal therapy depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
As far as medication is concerned, Kaplowitz is careful, but he admits that “depression of puberty can alleviate problems with the behavior of a girl and her feelings that are different from her peers”.
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are worried that they can get pregnant or how they can manage hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a period of 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is still no related file of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are at fault.
Boys – like girls – get puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study in girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which connects body fat with puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics tend to achieve puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, it appears that early puberty patterns are influenced by everything possible from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another argument: Although in boys at a low age there is swelling in the face and on the face, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as obvious as it is in girls.
Other doctors participating in the conference of the American Association of Children’s Doctors (AAP) added further complexity to this topic.
Acne and adhesion of the defense is common even in rabbits and battalions.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real stage of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist from the Goryebian Children's Hospital in Morristown in New Jersey.
Parents should not weigh on their child’s doctor’s instructions on how to talk to their child.
"It can mean the need to talk to the child before you assume," Kalowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who grow up early need to make sure that even if this happens early, this process is a normal part of life.
Hope Konvalink in the role of housekeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Sherečka Nadja Konvalinková (62) showed up for a break in the role of the housekeeper, and she did it very well.
That a favorite Czech actress planned to change her profession and set up a business in the house?
Nadja Konvalink showed up in James Joyce Irish pub and turned into a beer.
I did it the first time in my life, and it just worked.
The boss even offered to hire me and I could live with beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay at what I'm doing today, at the art," she said with a smile from Konvalink, who was a guest at the twenty-year-old running of the Irish house.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to put Irish whiskey in there," she said.
Nadi was also a long - term friend and colleague of Paul Nový.
I'm after death, and I can't cool up in my new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one pancake a day, and I'm trying to keep it," the actor added.
Manufacturers of aeroplanes wishing to have a width of seats, there are large orders in the bet
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, the dispute over the width of the seats in the second class of the long-distance flight took place, which resulted in a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai this month.
The subject matter of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long flights for the economic class – not exactly the ones that would normally have preceded the airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to claims for efficiency for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing says they should decide on this.
The dispute arose at a time when the aircraft manufacturer competes in the sale of the largest version of its two-engine remote aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the 17th to 21st November.
The way in which the rear part of the aircraft is deployed – especially whether it is next to 9 or 10 seats – is the basis of the economic performance requirements on the proposals of new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved model "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out by 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
Major aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertising in professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where it is expected that 777X will gain over 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently he showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed the financials a picture showing three people trapped in a restaurant entitled "Would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in seats of narrower than in regional turbojet aircraft," Airbus John Leahy said.
As the feeding skills change, people are bigger, but the seats in the aircraft have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health data, the average American weight increased by 10 per cent between 40 and 49 years of age.
According to American health statistics, the average American has a 100 cm pass in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seats from the 1950s when the average width of seats of a newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus argues that it has carried out a research that indicates that the extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing rejects the Airbus seat size and says it is not in the power of the aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than on the width of the seat.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to carry out things that they are convinced they must do to be successful," said an expert on the Kent Craver cabin.
They don't want us to dictate to them what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For the passenger there is a major larger space for the arcs, but for the suppliers it is an increasing problem that may affect the results.
In this dispute, the competition for aircraft orders with estimated trade in the next decades is worth at least 700 billion dollars in catalogue prices, enough to raise the tongue of American and European exports.
As the Reuters agency said in July, the deployment of seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
As Airbus and Boeing argue, they reach their latest two-engine remote aircraft proposals by 20% better efficiency than the leading market representative in this segment, model Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on comparing the design of 777X with 10 seats in the row and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in the row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened against the 10-season concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to speed up more seats, and make his aircraft more competitive against our products," said Kevin Keniston, who runs Airbus for Europe for comfort.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in order for existing models 777 are in line with that many passengers are for a thicker spread that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"The forty-five centimeters wide seat would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of view Airbus is a proposal motivated by the threat of model 777," said an expert on the interior of Mary Kirby's cabin, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer air carriers a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Air traffic controllers even carry a measuring band with them to check competition arrangements.
While I'm looking forward to being comfortable, all manufacturers also offer highly dense aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in line, but says he hasn't sold it yet.
Recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin adjustment by offering some of its aircraft wider seats in the streets.
Experts say that without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but can be made from the wave of sales of 777X.
The number of HIV infected exceeded the thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later they were 121 and in 2010 they were 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"On the fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, I believe there is no doubt," said the expert on the problem of AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led the Prague Light House for patients.
According to him, between January and September, 165 HIV patients arrived in the country, and this year they were 176.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of this September, HIV has been confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
In the Central Czech Republic there were 206 infected dwellings.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from South Moravian, 130 Moravian or 116 people from Ústecko.
At least the infected came from the Highland, they were 19.
A total of 88% of patients were sexually infected.
Fourteen people in the past have been infected with blood transfusions.
However, this case has not occurred in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the test, i.e. in more than a quarter of the century.
Six children were born with HIV, moved to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but it's looked beautiful, hard experts
A fantastic film from the universe Gravitation sold some time after the premiere in Czech cinema.
In October, he was seen by the Union’s film distributors of nearly 150 thousand spectators and won over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews of the images positively.
Others, however, find certain inequalities in it.
The Lidovky.cz server asked experts from a number of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some of the nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of the Star and Planetary Brno): I like science-fiction films that I consider to be modern, dream stories.
The film Gravitation doesn't stand out, even though it's a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but it doesn't mean it's bad.
I've enjoyed it a lot.
You can notice that Sandra Bullock's hair doesn't look like she's in a state of weightless.
Hubb's space distance and the International Space Station are moving on significantly different circular paths, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some film viewers calculate the unreal effect and even the whole behavior of the fire in a state of no weight.
According to them, the scaffolds would not have survived such injuries either.
The heroes in the movie Gravitation often get into a collage with various objects and clothes without any major problems.
Criticism has not even been saved.
So the widespread tragedy on the earth's circular path is, according to some discussionants, unrealistic.
She's also wondering why the doctor was sent to the universe to repair the technique.
People are also arguing about "unreal" behavior.
It looks like it's intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Star and Planetary of Prague): I have seen him so far only on a wide canvas, but clearly I can say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to hold to reality.
"More than the inequality you mentioned affected me, how three times is shown a space station with degrading level of technology (the last Chinese)."
"The Chinese will look better by the end of the decade than in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Director of the Astronomical Constitution of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, authors are very successful in trying not to violate physical laws, and thus naturally oriented viewers appreciate that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of movement, said by the dictionary of physics, is quite correct, as well as the view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin columns of the atmosphere and polar stars that highlight polar areas.
Incompatibilities will certainly be found in more detailed examinations.
In addition, when I read comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of the cycle of different cosmic trash on the circular path appears in some scenes to be reversed rather than actually (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employer of the Astronomical Constitution of the Czech Academy of Sciences): Some things the creators have adapted to their needs, but there is no fundamental and in the sky calling for a failure against logic or natural laws I have not recorded in the film and compared to other films of similar focus it is to see that the creators have given themselves concern about the probability of the events.
From moments that don't make sense it's worth calling it the fact that Hubble's space-dwelling distant view surrounds other than ISS.
As a result, there is a marked difference in the speed of each other and the rescue operation could not actually take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the time of the Kowalsk (Cloney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the whole ISS would rotate, so there is no clear source of force affecting Kowalski, which forces both actors to let themselves be at a time when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A new vaccine against nicotine may take pleasure in smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take pleasure in smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life from nicotine dependence.
Before testing on people, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical Faculty in New York says the first signs are good.
"We certainly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all methods available on the market today, but have found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that all current approaches are overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the development of antinicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce the gas flow of these antibodies.
The antibodies monitor all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the chicken from getting nicotine.
In tests carried out by the vaccinated mouse, which was added to nicotine, they continued their normal activity.
But the mice that were not vaccinated "relieved", the researchers said, which is the sign that nicotine got into their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often that sufficient levels of antibodies were maintained, so they turned out to be expensive and not practical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as they convert liver cells to factory for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for people would be completely safe, they could give themselves to children before they would like to try a cigarette, and that would be the case with nicotine.
However, it is much more likely that the smokers would use it to stop.
"I will know that once they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine they will have no benefit from it, and this will help them to get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but they point out that further research is needed.
The tripods deny that she would be influenced by Obed
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be examined by the State Committee for the Monitoring of Corruption.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal rental policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) extended its inquiry on Friday on whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying with several state ministers to rent him at Circular Quay, where Obeid had two restaurants and cafes, which had to be restored without having to participate in the selection procedure after his expulsion in July 2005.
The Committee is now examining the claim that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obei's hidden interests in these properties, on the basis of the evidence presented on Thursday by the former representative of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pressed for public procurement.
The tenants were against it and also wanted more long-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for companies in Circular Quay, which paid Obeidov $2.5 million annually, were renewed without the need to participate in public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competition.
However, he argued that the changes were made at Mr. Obeid's request, which, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, was on the move in government's rental policy.
The review of the calls presented in the IAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Mr. Steve Dunn, the manager who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic of talks during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policies?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obed.
Israel’s military aircraft attacked a target in Syria, the responsible factor said
Israeli military aircraft hit a target at the Syrian port of Láziki on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible administrator of Fox News.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what the objective was, but said it was at least one.
The Associated Press press agency states that the objective was to launch SA-125 Russian production.
At least twice a year before Israel made an air raid on the delivery of rockets in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the comment by Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was agreed that President Szczech was insinuating the disaster.
Heitman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen presented their weaknesses mainly.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has been unable to speak on television the most.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better chance than that of ČSSD designing the Vice-President of the Senate of Gajdóšk, the only one who would have no initial handicap and I think she would have a standard performance.
It's such a good solution that there's hardly anyone in charge to support him.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done, and to continue without disturbing the party.
Alena Gajdóškova could without fear make up a minority government with only a blessing from the President Babi and no people, but with the Human Health Minister Hovork, who is actually a credible social democrat.
This minimum government would have great stability because it would bring about a proper referendum law and would thus commit itself to support the President of Ocamura.
President Babish would finally settle for tax progress because he's smart and he'll see that it's not going to work without her.
People wouldn't be in trouble, because the Caller is the wearer of the best they have, and they wouldn't be in the government otherwise.
The same applies to the UN, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if they do not want to reasonably enter the risk government participation, but provide support, they will also do well.
Let's have the courage of Alena Gaydoch!
Foreign workers with visa authorisation may undergo a "justice" test
As the government intends to extend police actions, the "justice" test for foreign workers with visa clearance 457 is considered.
If accepted, the test will be applied through criteria to prevent the application of programme 457 to fill unqualified jobs, or as a rear door for family and friends moving to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour Minister Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers saying it could harm the Australian neighbours.
“The “voiced declaration of “citizens at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant since the unions demanded a protected labour market,” said the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce should be protected – and I would not see if anyone in this region noticed the response of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday at Sri Lance, where he was one of the officers for people's feeding, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
Where the ‘validity’ criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘nomination is valid for a situation where they are candidates for a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
After previous experience with companies that planned to sponsor a small number of employees, but then hundreds of them employed, companies may also need to justify the number of holders of visa 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka who sought asylum died with a suspicion of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship on Christmas Island this week.
His nine - year - old scared son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by a grown brother who was also on board.
Australian authorities and men rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island where he died.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 indicates that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
Baroness Kramer said the project "links Britain together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was co-operation with the British government on this plan "invigorated".
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase two will lead a line from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which conducted talks with the national transport office of Transport Scotland, entrusted HS2, to discover further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baronka Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that better connects Britain and its cities."
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it brings is huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a connection – across Great Britain will be better connected by HS2 to 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is for Scotland's good news."
In support of the Scottish government, Mr. Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "opportunity" to support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland an immeasurable economic advantage, but it also gives Scotland an economic weight in the overall case of high-speed railways across Britain.”
We are therefore excited to cooperate with the British Government in examining the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland and thus bringing all the benefits and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government plans to do.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British ministers during the following year and the joint decision on further steps.
In conjunction with Barta, inspections and anti-corruption police analysis were arrested
Information about the arrest of Víta Barty began to spread on Thursday evening when the report was delivered by the server First Name.cz.
MF DENS found that the case was taken into consideration by the General Inspection of Security Councils (GIBS), its people were supposed to arrest Barta in central Prague.
It was played in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
However, the inspection shall deal with cases where there are accused police officers, its power shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DENS, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is arrested - leading analysts and informatics Jan Petrzylek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The spokesperson for the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehei, refused to comment on the evidence that the media had to turn to the GIBS in this regard.
Even her spokesperson, Radka Sandor, but she did not want to say anything in the case, she pointed to the City State Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden realities," spokesperson Štěpánka Zenklová said.
It can also be deduced from this incredulous reaction that the event has taken place, but it is in a concealment mode that tells me not to say anything concrete.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Oldrich Chudoba.
The media said that Bart was representing "and in this matter", but since it is hidden information, Bart's arrest cannot be confirmed or reversed.
Some of the media first speculated that Bart's arrest might relate to some police president Petre Lessy.
This was proposed by Bart, together with former VV Radk John, who was in charge of the interior ministry.
The dispute that led to the outbreak between the expremist Peter Nechès and the VV had to resolve even then President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this relationship got to my person.
No one contacted me. I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said IDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became police chief.
He was officially beaten by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but he was Barta at the time.
Bart now was running for elections for the movement of Úsvit, the mandate of the envoy just escaped him close - with 175 votes.
Uzvitu's leader, Tomio Okamura, said he doesn't even know what he's talking about.
"Whit Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate and, as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Uzvit direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who before the elections said that he had given Bart's space to run for Uzvit, because he helped him solve the problem of the executioners.
Wít Barta felt at the court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Škárko.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will still have to switch off their tablets and smart phones during start-up and stop-up, even regardless of changes in the United States with a view to simplifying the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given the U.S. company space to change its procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical phases of the flight if the devices remain in "air" mode.
Travelers can already do this during the most important part of the flight, but many people are upset that they cannot access their electronic books during start-up and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this Decision, which requires US carriers to work hard to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not have a rapid plan to change their procedures.
The Agency for Civil Aviation Safety (CASA) also said that it has examined this notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA currently does not have any specific provisions governing the use of electronic devices on an aircraft’, he said.
This question is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers act in accordance with the safety guidelines obtained from crew members.
The company Virgin, who has already talked to CASA about expanding the use of its ship’s Wi-Fi entertainment system, has been subject to change but has announced that the decision of the regulatory authority is being taken.
"We would welcome if the CASA Office carried out an analysis of permission to use electronic equipment, because we really think it would improve the experience of customers now that we have (a wireless boat entertainment)," the speaker said.
Qantas announced that the current rules would be complied with for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change it in a hurry," he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in the development in the regulatory area that can be useful to our passengers, and we are certainly carefully studying the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind them.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, manual baggage programmes and passenger information.
"As soon as the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, the passenger may allow the use of portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones at any altitude of the sea," the FAA said.
In rare cases, the crew shall direct the passenger to turn off during the landing of the equipment.
The group also recommended that the heavy equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the storage space above the head during take-off and take-off.
With the growing mid-class buds, the Singapore resorts enjoy the flowers
Janani Amirthaling’s gold bracelet, ring and earrings are suspended in the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore so that she can pay her daughters school fees.
“We just bought a house with our husband, and I gave it all my money,” says Amirthaling.
Although every month as an administrator gets $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, he says.
The demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is indeed such that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her transaction, became a third-story stock exchange in Singapore this week.
The stopping of jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amithaling – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Stables in Singapore usually apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above 15.4 per cent of the rate offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, the founders have the advantage that they do not require a person's verification (payment history) or an income document and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that's why how families feel pressure from rising living costs and rising debt to households and consumer debt, millions across the region turning to capital.
After five years of possible growth from the global financial crisis and the financial loans supported by the money-laundering policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium-income are turned into stalls to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted increased use of credit in households mainly due to increased rentals as a risk factor for the credibility of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia.
Malaysia is at the forefront of an 80 per cent GDP record, which is an increase compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economics were also afraid of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which was only obtained this week from the technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"It is important that people with rising costs from medium to low [receiving scales] will try to supplement their income wherever they can," Song Seng Wun, an economist at the CIMB Malaysian bank, said.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are greedily stopping their personal property and taking advantage of the opportunity to change for the sake of their family treasures.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city halls are made of gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest operator stopped in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded up to 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its stationery in recent months.
Growth in the staging sector is so great that ValueMax, a tour operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four routes – but also to Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Yea Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD that it won this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discontinuous believers felt under the fire of criticism for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says that the flag offers not only lower rates than other believers, but also does not directly raise the debt.
"Customers stop objects already owning, and the financing of personal property does not raise the debt of the household," he says.
In the company, the property is increasingly accepted as a means of ensuring short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, not only are people in financial pressure.
The rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax sideways when they stop the Golden Routes or Rolex watches, and they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from every possible relationship.
"They belong to rich individuals who need short-term loans because of their bold trades or investments, or small businesses that need help with solving problems in their cash flow," says Mrs. Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as they can.
Saving package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government insists that the savings package of $325 million for composting health in Tasmania contain firm conditions that will ensure that the government does not waste financial resources.
The Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Australian Union is a "fast measure" to reverse the crisis caused by the ageing population of the island, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years has been decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Ambassador Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems it faces," Mrs Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the request of the patient.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and gray-collar operations, will help to eliminate debt.
Money is also available at free clinics in Hobart and Launcheston, better post-operative care, training health professionals, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are responding to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stressed that the government of Tasmania must require a strict system of proof and record obligations.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the Australian Union's money and to inform on a monthly basis where additional funds have been made available.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will not go to anything "until real reform is followed with a view to establishing a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system".
However, he commended the government for its response to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first brought up in a discussion with the government president in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can relieve public health from critical condition," Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
The federal-speaking opposition in the field of health Peter Dutton believes that today's declaration is only "a plague".
"The reason I'm here is that the Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from our health system," said ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which spends $300 million, and turns out to be a good news.
Mr. Dutton called Mrs. Plibersec to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be issued for higher red tape.
Guillaume Nickoux adapted the new Denise Diderota, which brings an exceptional film riding and making time, but is also more boring than it should be.
They take place in the 1960s in France and tell a cloudy story about Suzanne, a young actress who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When he wakes up, he enjoys extremely cruel treatment from a criminally rejected mother represented and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
The film will never turn into a momentary or sensuality, and that's his problem.
The rite of this story suggests that even the spectators will experience the pain of wearing a wedding shirt.
Skiers want to kill families with children
Syria has destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, the supervisory authority says
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with a poisonous gas, said the Global Monitoring Committee on Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while serious conflicts broke out in the north of the country, which is not far from one of the places where toxic substances are allegedly stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The notice of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came on 1 November,
by the deadline set by this organisation with its seat in The Hague for the destruction or disablement of the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery for the mixing of chemicals for the purpose of the creation of toxic gas and ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction is, in principle, an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, the Damaschek still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
It is expected that this country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons including hypertheitis and nerve gas.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira, which experts speak of as the factory’s headquarters for the production of chemical weapons and warehousing, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights with its headquarters in Britain, was launched on Thursday.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through the network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120 296 people had died.
This is supposed to include 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29 954 members of the armed forces of Bashar Asada, 18 678 pro-military warriors and 187 armed men from Lebanon are to go.
There are also 2,202 government passers-bys and approximately 5 375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that since March 2011, 100,000 people died in the conflict.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict has brought about 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
The Asad units fought in Safir against the rebels, many of whom are connected to Al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observatory stated Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
Fights have put the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in the middle of their mission, have to deal with the chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war in Syria.
A statement from the OPCW Office, which is closely cooperating with the UN, stated that its team is now "satisfying that it has verified – and followed the destruction – of Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling".
He added that "no other control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they weren't able to visit two places because of my security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW authorities stated that these two sites were "decommissioned and ... items of the chemical weapons programme which contained them were moved to two other declared sites that were inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether Safira's facilities were one of those places where OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has approved a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I call upon the courage and stamina that you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission, as this organization once had," said the director of the Ahmet Uzumc Observers in his comment to the OPCW.
Now, in their third year, they stand against themselves in civil war, mainly the Sunni Muslim rebel and Asad's government with its security forces, which are full of members of the Alawites, despite Shiite Islam.
With regard to further development, the chief of the Observatory Ramí Abdul Rahmán said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Láziki.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the judgment of the founder of the Bali bombing
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a bomb attack on Bali in 2002 reacted in a rage to the judgment of the last of the founders who were built before justice and said that Umar Patek should be corrected.
The Patak, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for setting up an explosive device used in the bombing.
In 15 years he could be released conditionally.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other issues of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings against churches in Indonesia on the St.
The complaint demanded an experience, although it could take time for a man named "Demolition man" to be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an expert on the production of explosives.
This decision brought back the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack by Patek and other founders almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Mrs Corteen said: "It should be built in front of the repairer."
I have to live every day without seeing other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when on 12 October 2002 a strong charge was fired shortly after the 23rd hour outside of the parked supplier.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where in just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide assassin set fire to a bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month and was kept alive, three times "dead".
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jama Islami responsible for the massacre – Amrose, Muchlase and Imám Samudru – who were repaired four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others isn't so much anymore.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the assassins in Bala.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but in January 2011 he was finally affected in Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where in a few months later American forces killed former leader Al-Qaeda Usám bin Ládin.
During the trial of the FBI agent in his testimony, he stated that reports of the intelligence services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Ladin in an attempt to re-establish the link between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't volunteer," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel sorry for the sorrow he caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th annual attack, which will be later this year and which will be part of the ceremony in Bala and Australia.
"This year we will see a lot of tears," said Mrs Corteen.
Patek can still appeal to judgment.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological outputs in aircraft (but they must not call from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic equipment "from door to door" – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – for reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the expected new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers don't expect changes to happen immediately.
As soon as the change is introduced, according to individual airlines, the manager of the FAA Michael Huert said at the press conference.
Air carriers will have to report to the FAA administration how their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the training manuals for the crew and the instructions for the storage of equipment in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA indicated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Between the companies that have already submitted their plans, there are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They shall not be activated until the aeroplane reaches a height of 3 kilometres and the master does not issue a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn their equipment off again when the aircraft is down to stop and not turn it off until the aircraft is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic disturbance may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and driving, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been adjusted to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher sea level are expected to meet this criterion.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"As soon as new rules are introduced safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success," Glading said in his statement.
We are, frankly, tired that we look like "watchmen".
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and texting or downloading data will still be prohibited below 3 kilometres above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be informed to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, online game of scrapble type that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, kicked out of the American Airlines plane, because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And the heavy equipment like notebooks will still have to be stored because of the fears that they might hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Phone calls will still be on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones do not determine FAA, but the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may cancel the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, an expert on National Security in Transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered at risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause disruption of the transmission towers in the air," Rosenker said.
The Administrative Advisory Committee established by the FAA to investigate this problem proposed last month to allow the government to use electronic devices more widely.
In recent years, pressure has been developed on the FAA to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat from Missouri, say there is no valid security reason for this ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult because the use of such facilities is everywhere.
Some studies suggest that until one third of passengers forget their equipment or ignore it.
FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio, technical output of the time.
New airlines are much more exposed to electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also constructed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic disruption.
For several years, airlines have offered to use Wi-Fi to passengers at sea level.
Plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
A large majority of airlines should adapt within the framework of the new rules for greater use of electronic equipment, Huertová said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio transmission than in previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimum broadcasts when the page is turned.
But the transmission is stronger when the devices download or send data.
Among those who press to free themselves from restrictions on the use of these passenger devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the aircraft with their electronic readings of Kindle and conducted pilot years, but no problem emerged.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities present any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Operators said he is convinced that the disruption of these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee have stated that there are only alert reports from pilots who should support the fact that such devices can cause air systems to be disrupted, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow the pilots to direct passengers to turn off the equipment during flight according to low visibility devices.
The Group of the Travel Industry welcomed these changes and said it was a reasonable approach for the passenger public, which technology uses to a large extent.
"We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported from a garden area in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on the oil surface in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One baptized was transferred by a helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA in the rescue center until he was healed.
Colin Seddon said: “This baptized man probably migrated from northern Europe when he was caught by a strong wind above the North Sea. ”
According to him, the forces came and the shelter found him on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted with a request for help.”
At the time he was baptized, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain (British trade) campaign was launched in April with the commitment to connect businesses and define what changes in relation to the EU would like to see British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies.
To this end, we have launched the largest and most complex research in which we have asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 leading companies representing UK companies of the most diverse sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be for many surprises.
We have found that the harsh majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want to see how the government is prioritising new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than hindering the long and intensive process of reforming the secret European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopolies to factory regulations – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
It was general dissatisfaction with the single market and the entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – the agreement even expressed 40% of the large companies, which is traditionally the most pro-European society.
Finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most excitable knowledge, although the clear majority wants Britain to work towards a change in the treaty and relations with the EU, which should be based on trade, not on politics.
The finding that companies of different sizes and of the main business groups were at odds shows that the business sector is pushing for a "reasonable change" that will bring back the impact on Britain.
There is a lot in the bet – achieving a change in the Treaty and better agreements for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% when voting in the EU's referendum.
The president of the government should not be concerned: this study shows that British trade supports its plan to renew British membership conditions in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this innovation to mean a significant shift from the current force to Britain.
The better agreement for Britain is possible and since the eurozone is being issued on its way to a narrow economic and fiscal union, it is even more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, this means a renewed focus on trade and fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
John Kerry confessed: The spying went too far!
The United States went to spying sometimes "too far", according to AFP's chief American diplomat John Kerry during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the Minister, the collection of information served to deter terrorist attacks.
"The first recognition from Washington" according to the AFP reported in the middle of a direct controversy on the two coasts of the Atlantic over the scandalous discovery of the collective monitoring of the United States National Security Agency (NSA), whose aim was also the United States.
"In some cases, I admit, as President Barack Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we ensure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the discussion, however, he especially defended modern - day practices.
The collection of information is deemed necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We have prevented planes from falling down, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to be informed in time about deposits," Kerry stressed.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair around American intelligence, which allegedly followed millions of phone calls, broke up in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide resentment, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach agreements that the monitoring would command or significantly restrict.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria starts a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream pipeline building in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom.
"Today we witness the border: the building started at the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the whole European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed "forever".
As soon as the whole project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream pipeline at a reduced price.
Gazprom says the building has to start in other countries towards the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed at an annual capacity of 2.2 billion cubic feet of ground gas.
Hizballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
He's waiting for a decisive battle.
The Lebanese movement of Hizballáh placed 15,000 of its warriors north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the Kalamún region.
According to the still explicit reports of Israel in the mid-air raids at two locations in western Syria, he destroyed rockets intended for Hisballah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army.
Its programme is also the fight against Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said to prevent the movement of weapons to the hands of Hizballah to Lebanon.
The reports of the Israeli Central Warehouses in Western Syria are only being clarified.
Israel didn't comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
The Al-Arab reporting station claims that two stocks have been hit, where missiles have been prepared for transport to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was the rockets of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron Ben Jišaj said that Syria is constantly trying to supply Hizballah with rockets and Syrian flight teaches members of the armed section of Hizballah to deal with missiles.
The SA-8 are obsolete missiles that have been in the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They're located on a mobile conveyor.
Although relatively primitive, with mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide.
They're equipped with a radar that turns off after the fire, so it's hard to focus on.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in the area inhabited by the ruling alawites.
It's a well-guarded area, and Hizballáh has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he's helping to protect the Syrian Shirt community, to which the avalanche belongs.
Now it is estimated that 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help get the army back to Kalamun.
Together with Hizballáh, he also strengthens his troops.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country of Homs.
The battle is to be attributed to the source of al-Arabi for a recent attack on the Syrian Shiite Brigade commander Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hizballáh helped the Syrian army to rerun the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many rebels from Kusajru just went to Kalamun.
Recently it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic were seeking early elections.
As a reason, corruption, money laundering for anticipated purchases and state orders, tax increases and in the last row of government scandals were mentioned.
According to the results of the elections, it can be said that most citizens have achieved this status.
That they did not really mind and that the state that was here (the theft and indebtedness of this state) were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, it would not be possible to explain that 3,413,497 voters did not arrive at the elections, 596,357 voters elected TOP 09 384 174 voters elected ODS as a whole, thus 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52,16% of all eligible volunteers.
Which is the upper half.
When 1 016 829 members of the ČSSD were added to the above-mentioned parties, then the old order (because all of the parties were involved in the "stealing" and the debt of this State) was in fact 64.23% of the eligible votes.
In this regard, most voters have found that they are not to punish the perpetrators of the theft and surrender of this state.
Or do you think that members of the ČSSD who share the principle of the law?
Is there any help?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) were accused of charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) in New South Wales had complained about sexual abuse of children before charges against the child educator Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011.
But before the Commission it was stated that in its opening statement for the Commission this association stated that they had never resolved the case of sexual abuse of the child in their organisation.
The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked where one of the employees of YMCA was accused of child pornography offences and another where a gymnast in Caringbah from YMCA was convicted of sexual harassment of children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, the board's counsellor, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initial declaration by YMCA was also inaccurate when it was stated that the YMCA organisation carried out external audits that assessed this organisation as the parent of the rights of children.
The evidence submitted by the Commission points out that the YMCA organisation was warned that the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year received the second lowest of four possible evaluations.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him himself went down when Mr. Lord accepted, without making sure that the staff knew that they were obliged to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was sentenced to 12 boys who were allowed to work in the YMCA association.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, refused to say that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting children's safety violations to Mr. Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was with the children on his own, in particular watching them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them that he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was under the control of Lord and asked for the training of the safety of children because she was concerned about his behavior, found that Jacqui Barnat, who was responsible for the services of children in the YMCA association in Caringbah, which was the Lord’s supervisor, was “very scary and often difficult to talk to him about”.
The Director-General said that he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt unsure if they should contact their supervisors and report the facts.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had obscured their judgment, so they didn't come up with a problem.
Mr. Hare said that to the Council of the YMCA Association in New South Wales, he gave his opinion that the training from "the case of Jonathan Lord" for the organisation consisted in the fact that the staff "did not give a message", and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow staff to sign agreements on the maintenance of the silence shortly after the indictment was made, the general manager for services to children in YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said that the aim was to avoid interference with the evidence, but was "excessively burning" and misconception.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University said that YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, checking, working, training and staff management.
The hearing was postponed on 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but he admitted that the return is unlikely.
In a nightly discussion on the occasion of his fifth anniversary of his departure from the office, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on different areas of home policy.
Since June 2007, after ten years in the leading position, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussions on British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as a envoy of the Biscay Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of minister, his answer to London's Evening Standard was: "Yes, of course, but it's probably hard to do so, so..."
While in Cardiff, the representatives of the horse training experts gathered to fight for the price of the Year's Horse, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although not yet going to school and only a few months ago did he make the first steps, this boy and his animal pet, Shetland Ponie Toffee, cut three rounds smoother to finally win the main prize and leave 30 sneakers behind with grown-up rivals.
These indistinguishable twins – with the same height – were approved for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition by Sunnybank in Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, stuck his bart towards a happy corner and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around.
Fenton was honored by the jury for its natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for sight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day since then.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee are working very well."
They didn't have great hopes, but they finally left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was just the second time he competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him a phenomenal and totally foreign people wanted to take a picture of him.
A boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales goes in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been leading horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was excited and excited.
He was running through the sand all along the arena and, despite being so small, he did a great job.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farm and got two chickens in care.
Given how he started, he'll be back in the year's horse competition soon and I'm sure he'll be fine.
Every year's horse competition said: "The Fentons are only three, but already knows how to control the pony."
It's a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way in which they conducted the competition.
They're always watching how good teamwork is between ponies and who runs it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the egg.
I'm sure Fenton also helped with some nice clothes, he really fell in there with him.
Too many newspapers are to be examined
Chinese newspapers, which on the title page requested the release of the reporter accused of the conversation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
News New Express has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later on on TV admitted that he had taken payments to invent stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now carry out "full repair".
The order to "correct" came from the State administration for printing and publishing, advertising, film and television in Kuang-tung province.
The preliminary investigation showed that during the period from September 2012 to August 2013 New Express from the Yangcheng Group Evening News issued a number of false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express news was irregular," the manager said in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a cancellation of a journalistic licence".
In addition, he "ordered the Yangcheng Group of Evening News to complete the overall correction of the New Express and recommended that they investigate the responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express".
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles on financial imbalances in the company with the construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his papers were issued on the title page two requests for his release and claimed to be worth his journalistic work.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had given false stories for payment.
"In this case, I have caused harm to Zoomlion and also to the entire media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV state news station.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I did the wrong thing.
After apologizing to Mr. Chen, he issued the New Express letter on the cover page of the apology, stating that he failed when he did not carry out sufficient control of his report.
In recent times, a number of dubious suspects have been reported on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of the amendment of this year's law, which prohibits the authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
A tunnel for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico was found with its own railways
One of the most productive tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico has been found, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities described the tunnel of dimensions about one times one meter as one of the most ingenious secrets they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is clicked to the length of nearly six football games, connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses, where you can easily hide trucks before loading drugs.
The authorities indicated that the tunnel had been closed before it could be safely transported.
Along with the discovery of a tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as drivers, were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the event of a conviction, the sentence of imprisonment from 10 years to after-life.
In Nogales, Arizona, passersby penetrate vast drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth largest corridor in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the Marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which presents a problem in front of drug cartels as soon as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a walk of about 650 metres long equipped with trains that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economy and the Centre propose management.
For example, joint advertising
The new integrated new-room of the economy in Prague.
The economy has taken another step towards transforming the holding of the Centre into its media home.
Since Friday, Economy and the Centre have shared top management.
"The association of organisational structures and the staff of the Union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the common media house," commented the Vice-Chairman of the Economics and Commissioner-General Kamil Chermák.
The Chermak, who will be in charge of the single management, will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the trade was named Pavel Voparíl, which is also subject to the advertising director of both companies Zuzana Tylčerová.
The new head of information technology became Štěpan Burd.
Vladimír Piskáček is the joint editor, with the team as well as the director for the transformation of Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pitts was assigned to the newly established marketing director.
The independent service of corporate communication is now driving Věra Lhotská.
The Joint Financial Director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organisational structure enables us, among other things, to come on the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better combine the content of all the titles issued and, last but not least, to significantly improve the company's commercial management," Kermák added.
The company, owned by its financial manager Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract for the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuální.cz, Female.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Našisto or portfolio of more than two dozen smaller websites.
The company Economy is the publisher of the Economic News, the IHNED.cz news server, the Respect and Economic Weeks and the number of printed and internet B2B titles.
The Czech publisher is the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles for a long time.
This year in June, publishing moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague.
CME will focus on television business.
He'll release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to bribe a thousand people.
He wants to get rid of all the other activities and focus only on his main business, television.
A group that owns Nova TV in Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia employs a total of approximately 4,500 people.
That's how nearly a quarter of people get lost.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will touch the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the foreign TV unit TV Nova, it is not clear yet.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," said the Communications Director of Nova Josef Koukolíček.
According to information from MF DENS, the significant release of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but it should have the greatest impact on the personnel of the CME branch in Romania and other countries.
Both new bosses Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who followed long-term director Adrian Sarbu, spoke during the middle conference with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce in particular the costs of production of its own series, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of the Czech Republic in Prague, the cooling tower was burning at night
In the industrial area of the CHKD in Prague, a large-capacitated tank was burned, according to firemen, apparently a cooling tower.
"The fires had gone out on Thursday, eleven o'clock in the morning, and fire was still on fire this morning," said Pavlín Adamcová, spokesperson of Prague's firemen.
The quantity of air pollutants in the environment as measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and causes of fire are still unknown.
About five dozen firemen have gradually arrived in the area on Colben Street.
"It's about the fire of a large-capacitated tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we're going to dump using tanker transport," she added.
According to the t.cz server, it was complicated to turn off the malfunctioning network of hydrants, so the firemen had to transport the water to the ognodu.
The fire commander announced the second phase of the fire.
There are a total of four steps, the fourth is being declared in the most serious situations.
The chemicals were also put out to check the peace of dangerous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of harmful substances in the air that would exceed the hygiene standards," the spokesperson told the firemen.
British police handed Assange a release notice
The British police today issued a notice of release to founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that 40-year-old Australians had given him a "issue announcement" by asking him to go to the police station and that if he didn't do so, he could be arrested.
Assange, under the British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court suspended his appeal this month against extradition, thus facing the issue to Sweden for charges of sexual crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in this South American country.
Scotland Yard "had given notice of the 40-year-old man who asked him to be delivered to the police station on the day and hour he was assigned," said the speaker.
Assange still violates the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification.
Assange is afraid that he will be issued from Sweden to the United States, where he can face charges of espionage because he has published 250,000 American diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks' website.
The driver was fined 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The driver was fined 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree in Essex was seen on May 27 at Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a bottle of alcohol between his thighs.
At a police court in Colchester Howie, he confessed to the charge that he was driving unwary and unwary.
There were seven points on his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of 90 pounds and an invoice for the accused 100 pounds.
As a result of tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has previously calculated the tax on the profits of the financial asset, but is waiting for Mr Osborn's final decision, which in the 2012 budget presented a 7% charge for the transfer of property for buildings at a price of more than 2 million pounds and an annual charge for buyers who own property within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the real estate transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea periods, which in the tax year 2012/13 reached 708 million pounds, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-West, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber together.
Mr Cook said: “Because of the increase in the transfer of property in high-value households and the presentation of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the property of high-value property is not taxed regardless of the effect of the obsolete tax system.”
He added that "this step could have caused some foreign investors to be able to buy properties in London, if the existing owners were willing to sell".
The leading properties – top 5 % to 10% of the housing market at the price – in the rich belt that reaches from Fullham after Wimbledon – saw an increase of 11,8 % in the record last year.
The prices in mid- London continue to show a steady growth of 5,6 % year-on-year, but have been overshadowed by a flourishing "home market", where, according to a survey by Realtor Savillas, they have experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) increases.
Scientists have shed more light on the movement of the ossuary associated with the presence of a dog
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs thrive on the oasis of more right (from dog's perspective), while nervous dogs have mostly left oasis.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and react to these subtle differences in the movement of the eye.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right side of the brain have a different connection to incentives that stimulate positive or negative emotions.”
We've been trying to see the same thing in other species.
He added that as with humans, even in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left movements and on the contrary, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information on how dogs react to the disproportionate rotation of the oasis of other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching films about other dogs.
They measured the incidence of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably won't take long before we figure out why their eye sometimes goes on one side and on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have seen dog movies – either in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette – in order to rid ourselves of any confusing impulses, and we have also managed to adjust the movement of the oasis and show it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw a non-significant dog move in the right direction (from the dog’s eye-turning eye), they remained completely calm.
However, when she noticed the movement of the oasis mostly on the left (again from the point of view of the oasis-turning dog), their warm frequency increased and the animals were not real.
Professor Vallortigara said he doesn't think dogs would communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, it is thought that the dogs have learned from experience, which moves they must and must not take care of.
He said: “If you meet the dogs and move their tail in one direction, it is repeatedly linked to more friendly behavior and the movement of transport produces less friendly behaviour, you will react on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that findings can help dogs, veterinarians and practitioners better understand their animal’s emotions.
A dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a professor of zoology at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study that examined whether the left and right side of the dog is important.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their head left when they watched an aggressive dog, and right when they were looking at a happy dog.
And in another expert agreement from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “The dog with a robot was more likely to be listed with a dog when he turned his eye on the left than on the road when they were more of a nonexistent – rather than the Italian study.”
The difference may be that dogs in these different animal studies in movies or dogs robots didn't exactly act like dogs.
He explained that she could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"Although in the case of many different mammals, there is evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not an exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it is likely that it will not take long for us to understand why their eyes sometimes go on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys moved a concert in Glasgow due to Alexe Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys group moved the concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with choking.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform on Friday at the Hydro City Complex.
The power of the lead singer Alex Turner made her move.
The group's announcement came after a similar postponement of the fourth performance in the LG arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official websites, the Arctic Monkeys Group says: “After deciding to postpone today’s performance in the LG arena in Birmingham and on the basis of a medical recommendation, the Arctic Monkeys Group must also postpone the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November.”
“Alexi Turner has been diagnosed with choking and unfortunately will not be able to perform.”
The performance in LG arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the performance in the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
We'd like to apologize to anyone who bought tickets for the inconveniences that caused them.

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis appointed for the first time the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are those who choose the pope, so František will establish his first group of men who will finally help choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as the cardinal reaches the age of 80, the election of the pope can no longer take place – the group is thus reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing this report, Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican speaker, said that before the celebration of the new cardinals there would be a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistorium.
"Papez František decided to announce his decision to allow the February Consistency in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said the number of elective cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as is necessary to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals as he wants.
Consistency next year will be significant, because it will be the first after František was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At this point, there are some guidelines for Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have an unnecessary number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which has been tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
"Now František chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that it is "very possible", that these cardinals would ask for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before – it's a complete news.
Valero said that the popes traditionally raised the position of cardinals of the bishops from great places, but František is "full surprise – so we don't know who he is".
GM is downloading some new light trucks in the United States to repair seats
According to the US Auto Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light-loaded Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra cars to repair the fault with manual loading of the valve.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism may be to mount the front seat of the trap.
As a result, seat belts are not in accordance with federal car safety standards for head restraints.
The notice on the State Road Safety Management (NHTSA) website says that "if the rear-end vehicle is damaged, the head restraint does not need to protect the passenger correctly, which increases the risk of damage".
Downloaded models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
GM introduced a supply to the market in June and for this front American car it is the most important vehicle to be placed on the market since the restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the supplier of the problem in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification to the owners of the 16-day government failure, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, rose by around 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its supplies.
The shares at the New York Stock Exchange grew by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
Ugly scream of Obama's voters
I chose Obama twice – I shared the hope of a change
Says Obama's sincere efforts have removed the obstacles of the Republican Party
Obstacles policy cannot excuse the passions of Obama’s websites for health care or attacks of unmanned aircraft
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard this second year.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would encourage and restore hope in me during the cloudy days of my second year at the Faculty of Medicine.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (Trufolast to Victory) and is a memorial of the Presidential Campaign Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finish my patient reviews tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and shows took your breath.
The elections ended with a heavy load and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My associates cried out for joy, and my parents hid the papers they had received.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready to change.
During the submission to the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent of its support.
And this is where I close the book.
Going to the moment is a tremendous awakening like talking out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I put in my first ballot, there really was a change.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the law on affordable care through the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “not to ask anything, not to say anything” after Usámy bin Ladina died.
Furthermore, I am convinced that the party obstructions have returned so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the possibility for the public to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantaná.
But in many situations, when I defended Obama's administration from my colleagues and friends, I have grown to an absolute limit when it comes to the explanation that they can provide.
I felt political despair instead.
The obstacles of Republicans cannot explain the consent of foreign leaders or the influx of unmanned aircraft killing innocent children abroad.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans, nor that it pursues those who reveal the wrong conduct of the government.
They cannot be made responsible for the correction of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process or for limiting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "more unaggressive ... than Nixon's administration".
And the newest cannot even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on the care available on a simple website.
I don't know if something like that could have happened.
Was I supposed to think in 18 years that government power could be in opposition to the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected function obviously does not have a predictable course and our public talks will create an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I mentioned above appear to be largely the result of my own administrative decision.
And it bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unscrupulous alternative and seemed unable to establish his policy and position.
I felt that the second functional period for Obama, released from the pressure of next elections, would fill the hopes that we had ever heard of.
However, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support this week falling below 45% – is more difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the number of promises that have been lost.
This week I read in the book the chapter about how Obama suffered a bitter defeat with Clinton in the capitals of Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are exclusively the opinions of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer argues that the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is at the heart of the interests of the parental leave program.
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say that the president of the government, Tony Abbott, is concerned about the parental leave program, because his daughters can get pregnant and get tired of it.
The banana magnet, which runs a dispute over the compensation of the carbon tax of $6 million, made this claim when he tried to get out of the table of the question whether he was in the middle of interest.
Palmer's United Party may hold up to four votes in the Senate that play a key role in deciding whether to collect taxes from coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that there could be only ministers in the interest and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could have personal benefit from the policy.
“He got into a great deal of interest as regards paid parental leave, because if any of his daughter was pregnant, she would have a direct interest in getting parental leave,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, after recalculating the votes, Mr. Palmer officially declared himself to be the winner of the Fairfax seat in the Sunshine Coast area due to the benefit of 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughter Tony Abbott Frances to Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the elections are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, plug in details into your computer, vote immediately and have results at midnight?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pens to mark ballot cards.
Is it that the results can get out of the way if someone doesn't like them?
In these days and at this time, the use of pens seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibility of electronic voting and has recently made a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the airport in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
The public office is a public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that we can serve the company at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
The scientists have found that they wash your hands and your arms.
The experiment involved 98 people divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an insurmountable role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed her hands after being healthy had a much more optimistic view than the one where her participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" in another test did better than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who were not washed.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not note any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical cleanliness really removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, the motivation decreases, the tests must concentrate much more on further tests.
If we were to transfer the results to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be the most optimistic when we get back from the toilet.
After using the toilet, I don't only have one percent of Czechs and Czechs, but on the road to town transport, it's five.
Most people are also employed in the garden or in a workshop where 85 percent of the people are skilled.
A household pet’s exposure motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent study revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, as much as it is necessary to wash your hands after the hand is given to another person.
In this situation, the hands are capable of 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be in place, I am afraid that reality is different and people are trying to get a little better," commented skin doctor Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two persons notified of the situation, the Royal Bank (RBS) is suspended by two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another sign that the global investigation by the control authorities of suspicious machines with the currency market is increasingly frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in investigating the largest financial market in the world, where each day the owner changes USD 5.3 billion.
These two traders would be the first employees of RBS to be suspended under an extensive investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR manipulation rate scandal (London interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment on the suspension but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our unfathomable observation on this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other bodies," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event indicated that RBS had transmitted to the British Financial Reporting Authority the e-mails and rapid messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position as President of the European Trade with Foreign Exchange at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President of cash trading in Cita, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Not one of these traders was charged with any offence.
In the group of Mr. Usher for the sending of quick news, bankers from Barclays and Citigroup said they were dedicated to this event.
This week, UBS stated that after the Swiss control authority announced that it was investigating suspicious machinery on the market with foreign currency in several Swiss banks, it took action against some of its employees.
At least six offices worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antitrust Office Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Monetary Office in Hong Kong – are examining the claims that these bankers have merged to move with the monetary market.
The notifying people said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also dropped internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
The banks are discussing years of old news and e-mails to find cases of violations.
The investigation reports scared traders in the area, which was one of the biggest engines for generating profit in investment banks closures in recent years, but which was disrupted by the fact that small imbalances limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation when they claimed that with a large and highly liquid market with foreign currency it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but the high position of traders is that it does not necessarily have to be true.
The highly established trader said that despite the significant volume of daily trading with foreign currency liquidity analysis between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms, "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices".
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that this week she missed out on her department for trading with the shares of a trader who lost almost USD 6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader has acted alone and that this problem has been solved," Credit Suisse said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the survey in 1986 to the end of this third quarter, the test confirmed a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This comes from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 were infected throughout the PRC.
Immunity failure has already occurred in 396.
198 people died.
The number of infected in the Czech Republic in the last decade is increasing every year.
In 2002, tests confirmed infections in 50 people, five years later they were 121.
The 2009 investigation revealed 156 new infections and then 180 in 2010.
Before the number fell to 153 last year, however, he was on the other side of the record.
According to the lab, they were 212.
"That the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, I believe there is no doubt," says the expert on the problem of AIDS Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led the Prague Light House for patients.
From October to the end of the year 2011, tests revealed a disease among 39 people and last year at 47, the Head said.
In September, doctors reported 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
Sickness of AIDS occurred in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who really wants to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the centre with memories, churches and galleries, more than he would have seen.
A lot of people are reading from the graves.
The cemeteries slowly fade and gain an intimate view of local reality.
They find out how many people live here, what nation they are, what their faiths are, how large and coherent families they belong, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how they care for their dead.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the United States has ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in accordance with the constitution, which is a fundamental victory for Obama's administration.
By its vote 5:4 the Court decided that the individual regulation of the Act on the Protection of Patients and Available Care – which orders citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or threatens them to pay fines – does not support the constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
The President of the Court John Roberts stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The Court also supported the remaining parts of the Law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which orders States to extend the possibility of obtaining health insurance, would otherwise threaten the absence of any financing of health insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
In order to block this law, 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Entrepreneurs filed a complaint.
During the spring of 2012, each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney, was strongly rejected by the law.
By the word "Mugabe is an ass" he no longer threatens prison, the court annulled the law
Until now, the Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they speak in public about the nineteenth century Mugabe, which has ruled the country since the beginning of the 1980s, and since the end of 1987, they have been standing in front of it.
According to paragraph 33 of the criminal law, the penalty for disregarding the presidential authority was 100 dollars to one year of deprivation of liberty.
"State representatives should not blame people who comment on the president in households or in other public places with burning guilt," the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government has appealed against the decision of the court, informed the British BBC.
Against the law, a number of Zimbabwean wounded, including Tendai Danga, whom the police arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a fight with a policeman at the bar.
In May, he ended up in prison an opposition activist who was frequenting Mugabe's public service with a "cuckling ass."
In August, the prosecutor accused a 60-year-old man of using a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court also declared an anti-legislative law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose declaration will later appear to be false," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwe's law has allowed the person who publishes live information to be convicted to 20 years of the defendant.
"The existence of a law allowing criminalising someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to speak freely," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, a new constitution with wider civil freedoms was adopted in March in Zimbabwe on the basis of a referendum.
A small step away from the dictatorship of one man, the country entered into in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition led to Morgan Tswangiraje's first chair.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and by 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 per cent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only foreign currencies are payable in Zimbabwe.
The proposed economy is at the root of the serious agricultural reform of Mugabe.
In 2000, he redistributiond the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience in walking.
Central banks will keep the swap lines intact
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the American Fedem, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks have put it in their joint statement.
"It's a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the leading international economist of the Bank of London Barclays.
"All the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not, according to my surprise,," adds Vojtich Benda, the chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bond that began to arise in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
Central bank agreements have enabled access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to complete its programme of support for the American economy, which could avoid the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency at the time of the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European Bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will monitor 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) knows personal data.
More than a year ago, I was registered on Tipsport.cz.
But then I didn't finish it because there was someone sitting on the sidewalk who couldn't finish the internet registration.
And because I didn't want to drive on another side, the registration went down, and then I moved, and that changed my address and the number of the civil certificate.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that it didn't work because I had another OP number, an address and that it just didn't work out, and that I had to ask for the deletion of the data and perform a new registration.
So I did so and on 24.10.2013 I wrote on technical support that I asked for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable privacy law.
For that long day, she wrote me technical support that I should complete the registration on the side.
This started the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where they finally wrote after the 4th emergency 25.10. that personal data on my request had been erased.
So one would say that he could do that new registration, and here they started problems again first, it was written to me that my user name was already contained (I don't understand it was deleted - it's not personal data, but finally it was deleted too).
So I used another user name and jumped to me that my personal data has already been stored to complete the registration on the side (how can they have stored something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
To my question, how could it be written to me that personal data were really erased 25.10. and to send an e-mail with that error.
I did this (about 3:00 yesterday) and I was told today that I had registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that that's why I didn't do it because I used the same name and date of birth.
What if I've been in touch with technical support for a week and I've decided it's still not going to work.
And what if the truth is what it claims (if it is not) could not be registered with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the intended e-mail and phone number and the world's wonder, I found out that I had sent an e-mail link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
It's probably because Tipsport weighs the registration on e-mail and phone number and data just didn't determine what it claims.
So I gave this back technical support that they're just lying (either intentionally or unaware of what they write), because what they write is not true.
I have reported several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. So "false" registration simply has no effect on this.
Tipsport has written me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but by being reregistered, we can't verify your statement.
And the communication's over.
The respect repeats the same sentence that the registration is valid on the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not fail.
So if I'm going to sum it up, Tipsport is not only that he didn't delete the data he claims, but he's still lying when he claims it.
Worse still, it's easy to prove how they're lying and trying to make it look like they're wrong on the client's side.
By the way, after mentioning this issue on my personal blog, things got a little moving and e-mail came from Technical Support that the matter was being referred for verification and will be informed (after a week of urgency and consultation and alerting on the same mistake).
In the subway on the Bridge plays music
The transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music project in meter.
The first vestibule, where the played instrumental music is constantly playing during the metro operation, is the Bridge of Line A on the exit to Václav Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček introduced his new two albums, a band and three singers
Texter Michal Horáček brought not only his completely new two-CD Czech calendar to the hall of the Colin City Social House, but especially in the order between us singers Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondr Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Mateje Benka.
After the opening intro and the sheer study of the late musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of how they last played in Kolina and in the theater and the entire town looked like an electric current.
"Otherwise, there were two types of carts in the Colin, with which I came into contact," he recalled.
He also reminded President Zeman's cousin.
"Maybe we could take a tour after the Zakolanes or Dúbravce at Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the scene and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new music.
The calendar also made Josef Mánes, who gave it on the eagle, about ice hockey, but once again he didn't know how to meet in those places and we're scandalizing who doesn't jump is not Czech.
There's also one song from the Czech calendar, but we're not playing here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang out of this album for him to sleep very well during the day, sing at night and accompany him to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers then accompanied the band in the composition of the keyboard, cello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vocalists sang together a little reverberating To the heart of the site, which immediately opened its eyes.
"I'm glad the song caught you, which didn't surprise me in the town of Kmoch," Michal Horáček responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapk, I was introduced to Františk Segrad, originally by Richard Müller rewarded with a huge applause, Hanu Heger again reminded the composer of his father's love of Lid Baar and with Horace's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of the Baar American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocába again recalled the composition of Sebastian, then Segrado sang the beautiful composition of Prague by Járda Svobodo, a jealous relative and former Kolinák.
But it was already a conclusion, applause at the stand and an addendum in the form of optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
One more supplement was prepared for the playlist, but the fans didn't look up.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček his books and even packages from the legendary LP and took pictures with any interested ones.
Berdycha with Štěpánka will complement Rosol and Hájek
At the final Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav returned to four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukaš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they go to the field of rivals in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The finals are the third Czechs in the last five years.
"We know that we're going on hot ground, that it's gonna be wild and we've always got to focus on our performance."
"Let's go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell it the best," said Štěpánek, the winner of last year's final score with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama how to bomb Syria.
American team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis were just suggesting how Syria's bombing was supposed to look.
Without any unnecessary misdemeanour, threats, and millions of statements, they sent planes, you hit the target and came back.
They would not allow themselves to be sidetracked by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole operation and no longer express themselves.
The exact opposite of confused and grand, unsubstantiated acts of Obama's Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying of the attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't be fooled by their claims that it was bombed "syrian base" or "deliveries for Hizbaláh".
Recently, I wrote about the fact that while the U.S. aid to secular rebels in the country remains only at the rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And just a fresh delivery of Russian missiles issued at the port of Latakia became the target of an Israeli invasion.
Clear message.
And note, Israel once again bombed the Asad regime, not the rebel, although it should be according to popular Internet theories.
The U.S. government has appointed 2 members of space units, probably Delta Force.
It has not been known until now that they were marked during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
Heroic death is known to be the death of two former SEALs members who were protecting the CIA area in the city, according to me, they were members of the secret CIA team, which was created by former soldiers.
It was long speculated what SEALs were doing at the consulate or even elsewhere in the CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any event, the information that the CIA has its office in Libya protected by clumsy nests (right to one such SEALs died after a minor attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two unknown heroes.
They were part of the American team in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi they volunteered to join the attack and, together with five private contractors, they spread their way to the CIA area in Benghazi.
Obama's administration is disappointed that during that attack, that command was not officially and completely planted and that it just bothered what to do.
Commander of the team, so without orders, they'll probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country is acting not on a one-time basis, but on an ongoing basis, American teams, CIA agents and private contractors are quite interesting.
And given that nothing has been officially acknowledged until recently and that it is now just some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the United States, even though it's half the way it's trying to kill terrorism in Libya.
Although it would be much more helpful to resolve the state situation.
The last place in the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago the media almost sang Iranian air force for cutting American drones.
Little is known, however, how Americans protect their drones effectively.
Of course, if they happen to discover their drone in the airspace, nothing can be done about it.
However, if Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in the international space above the sea, when perhaps the first sharp attack of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew over Phantom to visually verify his weapon without registering him on the radar or simply observing it, and then when he suddenly showed up at his home and called on an Iranian pilot to return home, he did not repeat.
It's not surprising that Phantom is a pilot of American production, but he remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Plzeň can still win, promises Rectoral
It's a little paradox.
While his team is largely not successful in recent times, the defendant or depositary Victoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that has led him back to representation after a year.
He's also got gunshots, he's running an activity, and after the move on him, he's been hit in the Teplic race.
Victoria scored in the last two wheels against Slavia and Teplís after victory, but finally she took one point out of these two duels.
František Rijtoral believes his team is breaking up with Jablonc.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we're going to beat the Apple at home," says František Reuters.
The team is carefully preparing for a hard fight with the Northmen who play aggressive football.
It's all about fighting with Jablonc, the coach is good at preparing us, as we always draw a lot from the video discussion of the game of the opponent.
"I believe this will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech fan representative at the Doosan Arena.
The last fights didn't come out as you wish, but Victoria's defenseist's word of crisis refuses.
So it goes into football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," my advocate of the West.
Victoria's team will rely on fans' support again.
"It's Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe that we will repay them for their victory," adds the Rectoral.
Jana Pētová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really about a step, it's about a big leap - a leap back a few years, and that in memory, into my childhood.
It's a reminder of what it was like to have no worries and just come from school and wash dishes, go out and do tasks.
Even though these "obligations" were mostly just theories, the desire of parents.
The practice was completely different - coming from school, throwing a bag into the corner and running out.
To play ball games with other kids, to jump pancakes.
Then, at Helen's show and her boys, they're gonna have a rare Christmas party for Grandma's birthday party.
And then, after a few warnings, finally wash it up, pour it out, in the winter put wood into brick stones and do tasks until after sowing under the lamp (or rely on the partner and instead of the tasks of writing the beloved verse addressed to the school lover).
Breakfast in the morning of the homemade strawberry marmalade (from the real fruit, not the jams that are being sold now, the contents of which were not lying next to the strawberry) and drinking it with tea from the dried herbs that Mom and I had so much love to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when we were recording songs from the radio on the tapes that were in the voice in the old cassette after Mom.
And then we went through those tapes on the screen, and we always played the same song, our favorite one, and they got a syphony.
Or we've been calling through the table using the drawers that were connected to each other - and when we're on the phone to better listen to each other, it was necessary to clean your ears thoroughly, then the host was a sirka + vata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live in such a way that we lacked nothing.
We didn't need any iPhones, iPads ba even mobiles and notebooks or brand clothes.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "adhesive" in the dress was beaten with homemade shirts using SAVA.
From electronics, we had enough to satisfy the mother of the above-mentioned cassettes and the maximum walkman we shared with our sister and we used only on the train on the school trip.
We've come to play more interesting with Aunt Hop or Man, don't be angry, or how I've already brought "only" out.
By the time I was a little older, we had a video player under the tree, and I'm sure his parents had been watching him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't play with us for a long time.
My younger sister put a stork into him, because she was so beautiful to pop those cassettes, she tried to see if the stork would fall.
Unfortunately he fell asleep, but it was his last set.
Well, and he's got this adventure today, poor guy, on a plate from his dad all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a kid, she was screwing up the video and she thought she was overplaying the recipe and didn't lose it, so she can't burn it until today.
I remember how we all managed to communicate, agree without a cell phone, a computer.
Together with our sister, we had an appointment with Grandma's granddaughter when we met again next year at Grandma's -- and that's how it was.
We've met.
Promise me you'll see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village ran out, built snowflakes, drove on snowflakes at church on snowflakes.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past few days.
Of course, we heard the sister before every dinner the Notorious well-known saying, "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, it applies today, but you certainly don't have a chained soap in the lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when Dad in the garage "worked" at a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay with Mom on the floor, washed our feet of brick stones, opened the door and looked at the flames and listened to the crackling of the wood that slammed out of the stone.
We were close - really - we didn't count how many friends we have on the social network, we knew how many friends we have, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write messages daily through different chats, SMS.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where they are marked by black corners caused by black and white photos.
And if I didn't happen to know how many photos I had back then, it's always a year of shooting.
I see that even though we didn't have enough listening to our scissors, and in addition we had our brother's pants with two bigger numbers, no one had a problem with us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back on that step forward - into reality.
By 2013, and I'll wait for what modern age might come up with once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of me now are for a young generation of teenagers, at least somewhere "a hundred years after monkeys" and I think that many come to think that this "precipitation" period is not going to come either.
I'd like that!
Google, Samsung and Huawei companies charged for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of missing Nortel, filed a complaint on Thursday for infringement of the patent against mobile producers including Google, a company which has been tendering in the framework of Nortel’s bankruptcy.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, complained to the U.S. District Court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for the violation of the patent.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of breaking seven patents.
The patents include technology that helps to connect the terms sought online with the relevant advertising, the complaint is the core of Google’s search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on the Google Android operating system, which is strongly competing for mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011 Google made a $900 million price offer for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent fight, Google received $12.5 billion from Motorola Mobility, which was partly motivated by the Motorola patent group.
"The allegations of failure in trying to obtain patents that are the subject of a dispute, Google's patents have broken and continue to break," the complaint states.
Rockstar seeks an increased compensation for the damage caused by Google because it considers that the Google patent is violated intentionally, as the complaint claims.
Miloslava Cepková: November smile
She came out of four degrees of Celsia, which we're not used to yet.
At first, the smile was put off by the one who was still giving up as a defense against the pleasure of the friendly environment.
This made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to give up on the public.
He was honest at home only the days when she was a grandmother and had Elinka or Adíka grandchildren around her.
And of course when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless business skills courses.
Now they're really good at it.
To keep her closest to her.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like wearing a mask.
November, no other month can do that miracle to make her really smile, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt enters the office of the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursí made an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day was only a difficult marriage of political unrest in Egypt.
Islamicist Muhammad Mursi promised "new Egypt", when he was officially introduced to the office as the first freely elected president of this country, after Husni Mubarak, who was met 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a building built with a view of the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are trying to improve tomorrow, new Egypt and the second republic," Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer who studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who, after most 84 years of its creation, had been an illegal organization aimed at acute attacks by individual governments.
When Mursi arrived in a small car colony shortly after 11 a.m., hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met before the building court to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential event Mubarak's period, transport was only briefly stopped so that the project column could normally be moved along the road connecting the city centre to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Mursi, funnyly referred to as the uncharismatic "reserved pneumatics" of the Muslim brotherhood, grew rapidly from his victory and his Friday speech, which was intended not only to present him as an Islamic candidate, but also to all those who want to bring to an end the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi said dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to judges in a wooden covered chamber where he made an oath.
The Mursi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to deliver an inaugural speech.
While he was watching, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The present was the military commander of the Polish Marshal Hussain Tantavi.
His income was accompanied by a scandal of “armies and people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as the centre of secular education and later became a garden of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrír Square, a place where a revolution was born that ended last year by the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and solemnly promised that he would again seize the presidential power of his office by the military council that had taken it from the issued leader.
But I agree with the formulation of official oaths before the court, rather than before the parliament, as usual, he has voted in favour of the army, which suggests that the fight will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrír Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In ghettos there'll probably be police specialists, they're supposed to calm down the tension.
In ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should be involved in the future.
They'd spend up to half their careers.
They'd keep an eye on the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to the reduction of tension between people from poor places and people from the environment.
In its proposal for the reduction of security risks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs shall calculate it.
According to him, improving the situation in the country would help mainly "fast-track social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 poor houses and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
He lived in them for 80,000 people, mostly the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on dosages, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a vegetable.
According to the experts at the trouble site, a hundred arrived in the meantime.
The relationship between their inhabitants and others is strained.
In a few places, anti-Rome marches took place.
The extremists were also joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the inside, it's hard for the police in ghetto areas to maintain security and order.
The basic condition is "the consistent application of equal access to the rule of law".
But without a detailed knowledge of the place and people can't be reached.
A specialist would go for walks in a ghetto where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd keep an eye on the order in the trouble area.
He would also know locals, so he could better solve problems or offenses.
"Thanks to tied confidence, specialists will be more easily able to prevent the whole series of illegal negotiations," the interior said.
Specialists in ghettos would get extras, 500 to 1,000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into the problem areas should be protected from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million kroner).
Czech Republic pays 15 per cent, funds 85 per cent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is scheduled to take place by 2016.
The authors were inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded sites is not even higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roman settlements," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, it's not clear yet.
The answer should be an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also matter how much money the police will be able to release each year after the project is completed.
According to the draft draft, the first selection of police officers will complete the internment in Slovakia.
This training should cover five tenths of the staff each year.
The most suitable candidates will come in.
There should also be special training for police officers who will act in ghettos.
According to the authors, improving the situation would help mainly social housing.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the representations of the inside, three categories should be.
The minimum standard would comply with the exact rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would have social housing that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan that would bring together social workers.
They would have to keep the accommodation order, take care of their health, send the children to school, re-qualify and actively look for work.
If they were trying to join, they would go to a higher standard of living.
The permeable housing system should operate within 30 years until the next generation is "in a pro-integrated environment".
The model of social housing prepares local development and work resorts.
They've got to move it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: The top of the coal - one of our youngest soups.
The coal peak is an imaginary hill 3 km south-east of Bruntall.
Together with a few others, the document of the collective activity in Low Jeseník is recent (geologically) in the time.
The last eruptions here were still at the beginning of Thursday.
In view of the greater distance, on the top of the hilly peak is an imaginable white baroque church of Miss Marie Help, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden tape cap.
The hotel that stood next to the church didn't last.
Shortly after the church was completed, it was planted in a row of four July, about 1 km long.
The crossroads at the top of the Ukraine are already the third version, the original one standing here after 1916, the second one, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden plastics that have been made by local artist František Nedmelel.
He used different types of wood in the Low Jesenika area.
Similarly, the cornerstones of the mountains of this area form an interesting geological exposure.
Each stop shall contain the name of the sponsor.
The peak of coal is the rest of the young fox.
Although data from radiometric measurements are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
He is therefore younger than the Big Red (age 3.3 million years) and older than the Venušina soup (age 0.8 million years).
Soupka was born with an explosion.
She threw out a large amount of sophisticated ashes, along with fragments of the tops of the floor, which were obtained by burning red blood cells.
At the end of this phase, it ran on the surface of the lava - today it is a layer of steaming cauldron up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw red, brown, and black tufts.
Their layer is strong up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the crack wall.
In the tufts there are imaginary vertical pumas up to 1 meter. And the second eruption was married to a lava mine.
At the end of the operation, the lava flowed out of the pond, which today forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of the stork cadre.
The most common type of soup is the juices in which the casting of the soup ash with lava flows is arranged.
Because they're actually made up of species, they got the name of the stratovulcans.
The original corrugated leather was gradually subjected to erosion.
But he was threatened until he pulled up a mountain in the furrow on the south.
The most intense exercise here took place between 1953 and 1962.
The tufs were added to a concrete that was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The effort has been made to stop experts and the public, thereby maintaining this unique place.
The problem, however, is the evaporation and small consistency of the mountains, which quickly winds up, break down, and dry down.
The break's going pretty fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, it is a warm, south-oriented swivel ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Thus, repair is problematic, but in time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are kept in a number of important locations.
At the top of the hill, you will get a green tourist mark from Bruntál, if any from Slezský Kočov.
Carmakers can use a free parking lot at the beginning of the July alley, where the short course begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a kitchen villa with a garden and pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts on Orechovce.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in return and the tenants had to move away with a small distance.
So Ivana was quick to look for a replacement home for herself and her older mother at the time.
She got a tip for the apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the other side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of a vast forest park and the overgrave on the other side inspired me," recalls Ivana for the first time.
At first, I thought it would be provisional for three years.
"Today we live here for more than thirteen years and not only because of progressive reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
At that time, the mother and daughter moved from a 15-inch apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not simple, things were stored with friends, and the step-by-step arrangement lasted almost a year.
The new apartment was in general good condition, but had to make the necessary adjustments, such as painting doors or changing windows.
The previous owner broke out of the core, but the owner was the most inconveniently resolved and extremely large front, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
The connection of two rooms has created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used to identify individual zones and join the Sadrocarton room, which allowed for a new location of lights.
The first step she decided to take after a few years was to remove the bee in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room got on air and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding green.
Another step towards partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor for laminate.
Ivan didn't know about the bathroom.
For years, I picked up the residence magazines and looked for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I made a recommendation to the young architect Kamil Douder.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivan says.
Thanks to the refurbishment of the bathroom, it has also been possible to adjust the available pres.
The architect linked the room to the toilet and the bathroom and replaced the two doors with the open wings by one moving which saved the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also sufficiently free.
Quality coatings imitate sandpaper, there is also a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet spray in the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamil Douder continued.
Within the order How the dream is built was a quick, but fundamental change in the living room, which was also shared by architect Martin Čeněk.
We had to get three functions, dining, living, and sleeping to the space that created a combination of two smaller rooms, without helping with the classical principles of optical division, such as semi-trailers or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a breach of the openness and unity of space," explains the architect.
Originally managed to separate the sleeping and living area.
It was enough to turn the back of the two sofas and place between them a peaceful box made of beads.
The dining area clears the shades of the floor and paint.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, an architect used a quality marble, a moving door revived with a pattern.
The kitchen corner shall, if necessary, cover moving panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergenic marble floor has a number of advantages opposite to laminate: soft soft spotless surface without spasm and better sound insulation.
The system of distortions and insights from the sadrocardon highlighted colors is an example of how space can be worked in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it would be happy.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," Ivana says.
The paper from the graph with the motive of flowered magnesium is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To a warm energy tone, architects chose a white, which was the result of a modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books have been stored, among other things, into space under no umbrellas.
It's all within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled away.
In the reworked interior, the contrast of the new with the older ones works perfectly, for example, with decades of the old crystal mirror and with the quality artistic objects Ivana collects all her life.
Last time the kitchen came in.
The boxes were previously placed on both sides, and the owner seemed a bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and changed their location.
The accommodation in a simple design is made on a contract, the white surface slightly softens the perennial surface.
They were dressed in a small space thanks to the invented solution of the washing machine, dryer and washing machine.
The view of the small kitchen brought a full glass wall over the work desk.
The unique graphics with digitally printed motif is attractive, and is also excellently maintained.
Ivana picked out the flowers of magnollies that remind her of the favorite neighborhood she lived in for years.
Now it seems she's happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small tub and a washing machine, the new owner chose the neutral shade of the cover.
The large shower corner has a glass door of Ronal.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from which functions and facilities would be in harmony.
The interior we brought together in material and colour and tried to make it elegant, cozy, not too crowded.
"The further condition of the task was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of daily necessities," Kamila Doudérová adds.
The Supreme Court ruled: Untimely complaints can be made.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petra Untimely may also be sued for possible criminal acts that could have been allowed before the August resolution of the Constable.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which relates to demonstrations in Snow White.
In the case of former members of the ODS Ivan Fuksy, Mark Schnaydra and Petra Tluchore, on the other hand, decided that they cannot be punished for any criminal offence until they gave up their mandate last November, said the spokesman of the Supreme Court, Petr Knotig.
By this decision, the Court rejected the proposal of State representative Iva Ištvan, who wanted to continue in criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they received a payment in the form of luxury posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not having any problems in adopting laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered these posts can continue to complain.
With Vít Bart also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's advocate, Oldrich Chudoba, who represented her also in the case of alleged corruption of the VV Members, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said, "Yes, I represent the client in this matter too, but in view of the protection of hidden facts, I cannot continue to comment on it."
According to the information, the case is handled by the General Inspection of Safety Bodies (GIBS).
The server said Barta could have bought hidden information from the police.
According to the first-serving server.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the function of Bart was allegedly attempted.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of Vita Barty and Peter Lessy is not related.
The spokesperson of the police president Eva Kropáčová has refused to comment on the fact that the Prague City Office is taking care of the case.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden facts," said the spokesperson of the City State Office in Prague Štěpánka Zenklová on Friday.
The case of Bartov is being monitored by the dark plaintiff, and its words do not directly imply that the case or criminal proceedings are conducted in a concealment regime.
Reporter News managed to catch up with his wife Víta Barty Katerín Klasno in the morning in front of their apartment in Prague.
She just loaded her suitcases into the car and left.
She refused to speak for the whole event.
On Friday morning at Bart's detention, the leader of the Uzvat Tomio Okamura movement expressed himself.
According to his words, he doesn't even know what's going on in the case.
"Whit Bart was one of many candidates of many parties to our candidate, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Úsvita direct democracy of Tommy Okamura," he added.
Welcome Bart, who in recent early elections in the Plzeňsk region has failed to run for the movement of Tomia Okamura's direct democracy, is known for its corrupt cause of the payout of the Members of the public.
In April 2012, he was unjustly sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Later, the judgment was changed and Barta was acquitted.
I want a contract in NHL.
I'm still thirsty, thirsty and excited.
For Prospala she was always in the family's first place, so she wanted to be fully subordinate to her 38 years.
Either he gets a job abroad and he's still gonna get his career extended or he's definitely gonna end up with a hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says a hockey player who is still looking forward to the offer.
Despite the fact that he's a well-declared employee who never misses anything.
Despite the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice and can also beat the players.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he says decisively.
Maybe he's waiting, and it's supposed to be New York Rangers who failed to get into the season, and they also have two injured defenses -- the attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
How does your arrival to the Rangers look?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on the paper, it's not worth the deal.
I know an article in the New York Post magazine came out that they should sign me, but that's all.
It's never been added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Didn't they even call you from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
That's where it's about getting into a situation where the deal really comes in.
When you need to get hurt, or someone can't do it, and the manchaft doesn't run.
There's a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get this contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, aren't there?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a chance there is, don't you think?
Of course, that's always the chance.
The other thing is, you always need two sides to do this.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
I'm sorry about the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to fall apart?
I have that expectation since July 5th when the NHL opened up the market with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
No, I'm not. I'm going to Tampa for kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
He's given that I'm a father and a husband, and that's what's happening.
Right now I'm not a hockey player - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm gonna play my dad and my husband and I'm looking forward to it.
It's been two hockey games for me and my whole family on Sunday when we can go support our kids in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in the warehouses for full coverage?
Yeah, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 matches for knee surgery.
And too much and too much fun.
One day it'll get to such a stage that all the goals, the winnings and the plays won't make you what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever work you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could ever see except my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL just because it's NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Because I'm a hockey player, so first of all - except for the family - it's also a sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My children, so sorry, our children - my women - grew up in the States, started going to school and so on.
And we would be very happy if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're gonna do is there's a whole lot of options in America somewhere else.
We should offer them such a chance.
So you're planning on staying in America all the time?
We'll practice it as we do.
This means that in summer we will be in the Czech Republic on the Deep Sea and around the Czech Budějovic.
And in winter again in Tampea or where our steps will take us.
It's perfectly perfect to be still warm.
I've had great happiness in my life.
It can be said that I went against him, it became a lot of strength and denial, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But the hockey team offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That we and our wife can choose where to live.
There are many people in the world who want to be able to choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long in your life will you be willing to work hard to train and wait for an offer?
Yeah, so that's the question I can't answer.
Today, I still have it in me, the herd, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have on the NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna stay there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say that you're waiting for this season to be designed and then you decide what to do?
I'm at a stage when I've been going from day to day.
The Director-General of the ČEZ recently announced that the construction decision of Temelín power plant 3 and 4 was delayed at the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State energy concept and by agreeing to the Contracts of Difference Government.
These are the reasons why CEZ's current leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to majority shareholders.
However, a qualified manager should make recommendations, not hide for him.
Grandma: I only rule with Saturday.
Andrej Babish is beginning to calm down that his movement of the UN will not have time to learn political leadership in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create something at all.
The President of the United Nations has approved this in the debate on the Law, which will take place tomorrow.
Trade and marketing ŠkoFIN takes Abrahamek
Its competences include product and marketing and enhanced cooperation with business partners.
He replaced the Man of Shantoru with a function.
For the last 14 years, Abraham has connected his professional career with the car sector.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, then in Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for Alfa Romeo's brand and dealers for seven years.
His last position was the company Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the car division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was born in 1992.
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles Airport due to the shooting.
At the Los Angeles International Airport, they were shot this morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly it was terminal three.
The Reuters Agency with a call to the California media claims that the men of the law shot an armed man with a gun.
The Los Angeles Times, with reference to the police, indicated that there was a gunshot in which two to three members of the Transport Safety Authority were injured.
How many people have been injured in total, and if there are any victims, it's still not obvious.
The Hazics are talking about events with a larger number of injured.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The aim was to be Russian missiles for Hizballah.
The Israeli military aircraft allegedly bombed the military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With an appeal to the unnamed U.S. government, CNN television announced this.
The Israeli press reported on the explosion in the reported missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack on it.
The Israeli army spoke on the CNN's question refused to comment on the situation.
"We do not speak to foreign media reports," she said.
According to the US government's source of missiles and related equipment, Israelis believe that they could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement of Hizballáh.
The AP Agency, with a reference to another U.S. security factor, informed that the target of an Israeli raid on the Syrian territory was Russian SA-125.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the purpose of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defence system.
Satellite images of the attack area but according to the DPA agency showed Russian-type S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they saw the SA-3 battery including the commander's radar radar to monitor the missiles and their targets.
The recorded missiles are reported to have reached 35 kilometres of Israeli television and could carry a weight of 70 kilograms.
Israel has already bombed missiles inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP have reported.
The Israeli army never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would attack any shipment of weapons destined for Hizballah or other terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recruits in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel office now expects its annual basic profit before tax to be shifted between USD 325 million and USD 340 million against USD 305 million to USD 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, it will represent a twelve-to-seven-percent increase towards a record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
Director General Graham Turner said that Flight Centre created eight percent profit in the first half and that the second half began to grow rapidly mainly in Australian and British travels outside the service.
"To date, our 10 countries are profit-making, and several are targeting record annual profit before interest and tax," he said.
Here belong Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest profitmaker.
During the second half of Australia, a company with recreational activities grew up, which compensates for a slightly lower domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain, Flight Centre managed well in the recreation sector, while business customers lost less.
America’s trade has recovered during the season and is expected to bring the third in a series of annual gains.
Flight Centre's stock was 3 cents higher than $38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to Petrograd
Environmental activists detained from September in Russia due to a protest against planned oil extraction in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrograd.
She informed the AFP agency about this today with an appeal to the international greenpeace organisation.
At the same time, it claims that the original charges against her activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International found out from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women, detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil platform in the Arctic, were transferred from the correctional facility in Murmansk to the Petrograd prison," the organisation announced in a statement.
The reasons for moving detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, the planned move was.
Ecologists were first accused of piracy, which threatened them for 15 years in prison in the event of conviction.
Last week, however, it was announced that this accusation would replace a lesser exaggeration, which threatens the lower sentence with the upper limit of seven years of imprisonment.
Greenpeace, however, pointed out in today's statement that the government's piracy charges have not yet been dropped, as they promised.
That means that detention is now charged with two criminal acts.
The Strong Investigation Committee announced last week that the charge of piracy is being compensated for the charges of extortion.
However, when thirty prisoners were imprisoned this week before the committee, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new accusation was brought against everyone," the AFP quoted from Greenpeace's statement.
Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil station in mid-seven.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship that sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, everyone has been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Under the conditions of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
According to AFP, the Executive Director Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo today stated that the move to Petrograd will facilitate meetings held with families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that conditions in a new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he warned.
She asked for help from King Willem-Alexandra of the Netherlands one of Faiza Oulahsen's detained activists.
In a handwritten letter, published today by Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch called on him to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It claims that Malik has a large share in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is partly part of the fights also in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare game, a 19th - century novel, a romantic poetry, and the modern British Beleteria will have to be studied in English.
The test will also include ‘hidden text’, in order to give reasons for further reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a language examination and will be invited to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue new bases for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first items to undergo a radical change.
For other key items, the changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Offqual Office, which oversees the graduation exams, will discover changes in the structure of the graduation exams, along with a new marking system and a smaller amount of projects for students.
In his speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that he has a "wide consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society" and that it is necessary to insist that the graduation test be "more demanding, more ambitious and more stringent".
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison of school in Australia, mathematics is spent on average 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics, the coalition sources have indicated that a higher emphasis on this subject in the result sheets is likely to encourage schools to provide further training.
The training plan will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Prime Minister Kainar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the elections, the long-standing dispute between the two wings fighting for influence within the island of ČSSD was completely resolved.
It all came to an end when the Prime Minister of Ostrava Petr Kainar turned to court for the non-democratic formation of candidates.
The perpetrators, however, did not want to express themselves too much so that they would not further damage the party before the elections.
Now, however, the voices of the voters have been counted.
The management of the island ČSSD so immediately on Monday evening called the prime minister of Ostrava to step out of the side, and will obviously press on to lose his function.
Peter Kainar wants to keep fighting.
What's going on in the disputes, and who's on her side, he described it in an exclusive interview for Dinik.
How do you perceive the outcome of the elections?
ČSSD must have counted with a much better result.
Did it hurt her that before the elections they had resolved in the media disputes inside the party?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which ČSSD is now.
It's the party that has its internal problems, it's internal sick, and people think it's not all right.
In the elections, they made it clear.
What are those internal ČSSD diseases?
I think the ODS has been going down for some time, and things like this are now, unfortunately, being played in social democracy.
It's like lobbies, affecting people who used to expect their vantage points to be found at the ODS, moving to people in the ČSSD and affecting them.
It then relates to the fact that the police go after the island magistrate's offices and collect computers.
This shows that ČSSD is not only composed of people who would want the good of all others, but most of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two unrestable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a premonition of what is happening now in Prague.
The Haske's wing gradually held its position so that the election could lead to a situation that weakens the Sobotka's wing.
Man is in politics in a situation where he has to compromise at times.
But everyone has some internal frontiers when the compromises don't go, and that's my case.
Originally, I didn't want to run into the camera, but when I saw the whole thing inside, I agreed with Lubosh Zaoralak that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen the Sobotk wing as the Prime Minister of Ostrava.
The Haske's wing, however, gave way to it.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, not Mikhal Haška?
Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and to some extent about visas for the side and this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I didn't hear anything like that.
Michal Hasek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
It's a fight for power regardless of everything and against the states parties.
According to me, what Michael Hasek has now done in Prague has ended his political career.
How did you realize that the island leadership of the ČSSD on the candidate did not approve you?
The political parties are based on a competition that will take place as one of their members.
This competition should be based largely on program visions and on the ability of those people to fill those visions.
Of course, however, there are also people who do not have the ability or the vision, but the political party is for them an elevator to the money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start getting ahead of themselves because they break the rules without screwing up, they break the party's statements.
They're doing their own business on the political side of the mafia, and I think the laws of the Czech Republic are breaking them.
It is more important for me to be aware of this problem than to take into account whether any Cainar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect their views.
That is why you have submitted a motion before the elections to the court for preliminary action against the form of the candidate ČSSD in the Moravskosleskie region?
The current ČSSD Executive Committee in Ostrava reaffirms its power by the fact that organisations which do not suit it can cancel, aim to establish a new organisation, gradually dismiss the uncomfortable members of the party.
For example, they wanted to expel Richard Bednaři from the deputy club, but he filed a complaint against it and then they chose to cancel the ruling on his expulsion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party’s position through the court is the last option, but at a time when the other ways and control authorities within the ČSSD have ceased to function, this is the only option.
The strong leadership of the island ČSSD in front of Ambassador Adam Rykalou is to call you out of the prime minister's office.
It's a public secret that this post has the honor of Mayor Poruba Lumír Palyza.
That's right, Adam Rykal and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me out.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then for those votes they strengthen their power in the side.
When I get back to the past, everything that might have happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the Bazala Stadium was just a excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could label me a man who gives money where he doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought a property that had strategic value for it.
So how do you see it with your stay in the prime minister's office?
The circuit committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in ČSSD.
But I think it's like when a thief yells, "Get the thieves!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I see no one in the island social democracy who would initiate and prosecute, sometimes against the members of the party, the emergence of as many developmental things as industrial zones or the expansion of the scientific and technological park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I don't read it except to prevent the others from being sold to places they're looking for.
Are you going to try to fight them again?
Because if this republic is to function well, then the political parties must also function well.
I find it hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively drive the state if they can't even drive themselves.
So I don't think I'd leave the ČSSD now, because I think that the one who causes cancer on this side is not me, but those people who are trying to get me mad.
The Olomouc opens in the historic center of public clausty
The organizer of the Hollow Christmas Markets and the Winter brewing Paul Sálaný stated that the preparatory work at the castle was launched on 26 October and since Wednesday it has been in operation to add to the production of ice.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The castle has 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
The brucellars and the surrounding will also have two benches with a punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, expanded the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire floor of the podia is shaken so that the brewers can easily read," described Burned.
Olomouce Streets are already commemorating the coming Christmas.
Last year the centre for repair of the Lower Square was installed right before the main hall entrance at the Upper Square.
Repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the year, so the ice area could return to its original location.
For the first time, people were able to break down just before the councillors in 2009, when there was a lockdown in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, part of which is a rich cultural programme, will be launched at the Upper Square a month before St.

The brutal murder of seniors in Zlinsk will be re-solved by the regional court
The Court of First Instance dismissed the accusations of a five-year-old Slovak and a two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the guilt.
They are threatened by 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or with an exceptional penalty.
Speaking by Peter Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had annulled the regional decision and returned the matter to the hearing.
The reasons for this led the judge to refuse to comment that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the accusation, the young man had been beaten in his house for seventy years.
The senior died of a tragic death.
According to her complaint, her men were scratched, and buried all over her body, as well as with a metal object, probably a gas gun, and put about three tenths of the wound in his head.
A man has suffered serious injury, such as a fracture in his liver, a stroke of the brain, or a bleeding in the brain that he is at the site.
Young people from the house may have taken about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the Regional Court, they were the only, in addition, only indirect evidence against the defendant's breath traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of legal instructions.
In more than ten cases, the smells from the scene of the crime and in other cases coincided with the defendants, however, the police began to treat them as material rather than smells.
In addition, there was some doubt as to how they were dealt with.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was not proven without any doubt.
However, the Court found that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found relatives who thought he was probably falling down and injured himself.
She did not even notice the death of a loved one.
After a few days, the criminals contacted broken doctors who discovered signs of violent death during drinking.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime that relatives have been doing.
There's no DNA on the scene.
A young Slovak lived in Uherskogradišk.
Now he is repudiating the penalty of 8.5 years, which was confirmed by a powerfully breaking Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was an organized group of six young men who are aware of the corrupting influence of gold.
Loupes took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the assassination of the senior in Slopné.
The youngest of the defendants charged with the murder of the senior resident in Uherska Hradištka.
He was released by the court in August after 11 months.
The sweat begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was picked up by the builders who were going to rebuild the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages in order to reflect the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Winter End
The Saxophone Great and the legend of Wayne Shorter's jazz scene will be held next Wednesday for the 18th year of the Winter Struna Festival.
The shorter will be released on 6 November in the Grand Hall of Lucerny together with its quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia is added to Shorter under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
In the Shorter Adjustments for Symphonic Orchestra, Pegasus composer from the news album Without A Net, as well as his senior composer Lotus and Prometheus Unbound, will sing.
Although the 18th birthday was celebrated this year in August, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert in the autumn starts his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the music world over sixty years ago.
The number of interpreters he collaborated with goes from Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
He also met with Czech musician Miroslav Vitoš and Vienna's cousin Joe Zawinul, with whom a new style of fusion was being introduced in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
He's been dating Wayne Shorter Quartet for the last 13 years.
Like the afterparty after the festival, there will be still a spotlight club night, which will take place on 9 November at the Roxy/NoD club.
Along with the charismatic singer Andrey Triany with the foreign audience, the Manchester Trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who brings the electric formation of Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
The ladies and gentlemen forbid UEFA to publish sentences for the judge.
Dagmar Damkova, president of the decision-making committee of the Czech Football Association, stopped publishing sentences for the courts.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which it has mentioned in the Legal Journal.
Otherwise, he'd be threatening the FAČR position.
The lady also refused to tell the footballers where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Plšna, but the other members of the Commission are odugud, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6,” Damkov said in response to criticism, which broke after Plzen last time playing twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
So even though FAČR has stopped publishing sentences for the judge in recent months, Damkova assures the judges that they are proud of their mistakes.
"Trust me that if the Commission finds out that the judge has made a mistake, his delegation will limit him to any fight," Damkova said.
The reason why penalties are not published is according to the Dam's ban on the European Union football.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and the violation of strict penalties."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published restrictions, but I have received two very important warnings that if we do not stop, there will be severe sanctions," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If information continues to be published, the Commission could lose money from UEFA on education and decision-making.
"And you are very important to us."
"Without them, we couldn't fill out the program at decision-making," Damkova added.
The Bart's detention is related to Januske and Behem: Are they behind the mission?
The President of Public Affairs of Vít Bart was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, he was also detained by the head of the anti-corruption police analysis and IT committee, Jan Petrzylek.
Detainment related to the mission of the lobbyist Romana Janouška and former Prime Minister Paul Bém (ODS).
Information about the senders with whom the server Novinky.cz confirmed a confidential source to the Czech press office.
Listened to the phone calls Janouška and Béma, who published the Young Front today last March and in which both men address each other "Mazanka" and "Kolibrík", show Janouškov's influence on the steps of the city under Bem's leadership.
The Journal then stated that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BIS) was set up, two years later, and was avoided by the ABL Security Agency.
That's when he owned Bart.
Server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petržielek was working before his entry to the anti-corruption police for the BIS.
To the anti-corruption agency that subsequently took care of the mission, Petržílek moved to the same time they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I can't at least confirm anything or say anything," said Prosecutor Michal Muravský of the City State Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that the case was being monitored.
The case does not want to comment on an inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for a new civil law
As of 1 January 2014, six of the ten companies are intensively prepared for the forthcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporation Act.
Only eight per cent of the company’s respondents indicated that the issues related to both key codes in their company had not been addressed at all.
It comes from an investigation by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, who has found the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching deadline for the effectiveness of both key codes, only now a number of managers are becoming aware of the significant impact they can have on their companies’ business.
The biggest changes in private law over the last 50 years are, in our view, affecting all citizens and businesses in the Czech Republic.
For the sake of policy-making, the business sector has lived in uncertainty for a long time whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually happen.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to move to new rights for their companies without any complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil.
Of the 61 per cent of companies actively involved in the new laws, 26 per cent indicated that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
A further 35 per cent of companies from this figure are going to take the necessary measures at the earliest possible time.
In contrast, every fifth company with the re-registrations has not yet been involved, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and no problem can be assessed.
Only eight per cent of companies admit that the issues associated with the registrations have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue relating to the new civil law is the maximum number of companies in question to conclude new contracts (21 per cent), followed by the settlement of trading conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the inventory of property and liability for damage (ten per cent).
One of the most important news of the entire codification of the agreements is the unification of the amendment of the agreements only within the framework of a new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in civil and commercial law will disappear, resulting in more transparent contractual law for citizens and businesses.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment will offer a lot of news with emphasis on greater freedom to organise relations," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukaš Poddaný.
In relation to the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the most relevant topic of the problem of increasing the responsibility of statutory authorities.
The following are topics relating to changes in the calling and running of the rolling stock (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal framework means the strengthening of obligations and possible effects for the statutory authorities, in particular in the event of a company's loss or acquisition.
"In practice, this means that if members of the company and members of the company do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the company's dangerous decline, they may benefit from the performance of the function for the last two years," Spačil added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop Cartier's style as a living language

Travels through the bay, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat almost every weekend hundreds of patients
In West Africa there are not too many doctors; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates at the CNN Herdin Prize in 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the top ten candidates in the 2013 CNN Prize.
The winner will earn $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
All 21 years old Georges Bwelle was watching his father fall into unconsciousness again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in an automobile accident near the main city of Cameroon in 1981.
He was first treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread into his brain, and there he developed a hematoma that affected him all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave home at five in the morning, hurry to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants is in Cameroon.
For comparison only, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the doctors of Cameroon could visit, many could not afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health care expenditure in this country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
They can't enjoy their lives because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team did 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor of cervical surgery in a central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded a nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose weekend members visit rural areas where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have been helped by their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday he and 30 people rush into delivery, attach themselves to medical needs and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
It's not always a good time to accompany them.
Suddenly the vehicles must press through the river and the bay.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted as real heroes: host, song and dance and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages medical care is really free of charge for celebrating and Bwelle – with her wide smile and unsweetened energy – is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day the team starts treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on every trip," Bwelle says.
They're coming to the village about 60 kilometers away, and they're walking.
During each of these weekends doctors provide various health care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, hypertrophy, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get glasses or glasses or birth certificate for free – a document that requires school, but which many loved families simply cannot afford.
Tonight, the team is doing a simple operation under local narcosis.
The surgery usually takes place in a building school, at a hospital or at home; the patient wakes up after the operation and goes to the recovery site to free another patient.
With the light from the generator, the operating room and Bwelle's hygienic equipment, and his volunteers, they're working for early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but rural musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
"To stay up and keep working, they play drums all night," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team is heading back to town, tired, but proud of its work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 operations for free last year and realized that their assistance could mean a lot to locals.
One man said he'd be able to work again after surgery.
"This will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he works for private clinics around Yaounde at night.
It says that this second job is financed by around 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when he's actually sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia the second year and working as a volunteer for the Bwelle Group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to get money for the organization so he can do these campaigns.
For medical and medical students, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get home.
"Dr. Bwellem we thoroughly washed our hands and removed blood clots or held his tools," says O'Malley.
As a medical student in the second year of America, you will never experience it.
Voluntary students will usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they get to Yaounde, Bwelle provides food, transportation and study.
"No doubt it's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the inhabitants of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle's constant stress is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives, fulfilling the promise that he gave to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I mean my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To mock people, to ease their pain – that's why I'm doing it.

Minister Holcát restored the role of the main sister for the Czech Republic
The main sister for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalised to have the nurses of their representative within the structure of the Office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I respect the work of my sister, and I think that the care sector deserves to be given due attention by the ministry.
In carrying out this mandate, not only is there a high level of professionalism, but there is also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I'm happy and with all my responsibilities, I'll try to promote the steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and charming sisters in our health, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us too much with their approach to patients to perform their duties with all empathy and help us in public view to improve the image of the sister," says Alena Schmidová.
The newly appointed Chief Sister for the Czech Republic, Alena Schmidová, on the occasion of her appointment, also stated that she would like to take care of the various aspects of her health position and would like to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, teachers, other non-medical appointments and doctors.
"I don't really want to separate the appointment of doctors and nurses, but I see them standing next to me, each having its own competence and together with other health workers are a busy working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that arise when I have a sister's appointment, I perceive these inconveniences and I intend to share in their solutions."
They include, for example, the simplification of medical and health documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the sisters are exaggerating and wasting their time, which could and should be more devoted to patients," says Alena Schmidová.
Other areas to which it is intended to focus include improving working conditions, seeking ways to improve team and management of healthcare providers, adjustment of skills and labour law issues, such as compliance with the labour law or non-transference of sisters with insufficient numbers at the time and place.
We often hear anonymous rumors, which are not documented in a specific case because of fear of a possible position, where there might be a violation of the rules.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the Czech Principal Sister could in this case serve as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such complaint and a specific case to allow the competent authorities to check," says Alena Schmidov.
Mgr. Alena Schmidová studied High School in the field of Health Sisters (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Karlova in Prague in the course of the course of the course of nursing - teaching (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, it has been acting as the Head of the Department of Health and Other Non-medical Sectors and Qualifications for the Education and Science Committee of the PRC.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bed in the interior department, further acting as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also 8 years old as a statutory deputy director.
From 2004 to 2009, she acted as the main sister of the Czech Prison Service.
She published several specialized medical textbooks and articles in professional journals, devoted herself to teaching activities in the field of medical care.
He is not a member of any political party.
Don't make me hate you.
The writer of Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes the new novel Wind, darkness, presence.
That it is not a remote link, it suggests the number of parties comparable to its most famous part of Houstina (Peter, 2001).
For Salon Kahud, another prominent Czech writer of the day - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it, so I wouldn't get caught up in hate.
To see around you still new and new clones of human foolishness, young organisms affected by blind self-esteem.
I don't even talk about us, the views destroyed by powerless pleas, the interlocking soul and the opposite overlap of the ideologicals who are trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little selling whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a little digital camera and filmed my legal friends, surprises, and hidden services.
I've been through this.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from my life on this planet.
I don't like going for walks, and then tonight I'm at the book-reader.
You're talking about the feeling of death, hate.
Was there something that affected you in the past, or are you just gonna be old like us all?
A breach occurred a long time ago, about ten years ago.
There was no name at the time.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see another lonely circus, everyone in his own tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I participate in this vast, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the production of an incomprehensible future.
Those restless, breath-taking complexes of life, when every stone is the direct legacy of our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, when another generation of beings emerge by way of experiment-omyl, which in billions of interactions per second creates some superlative, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you view your writing as a transitory process, or have you started completely from scratch?
A conversation, or better spoken dialogue, which leads to the right and left half of the brain, sometimes flows into the cold and forms in the book.
As the period of peace is covered by silent sleep metastases of wars that may arise one day, so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I've been feeling like my life's veins are growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'm gonna get stuck.
It's a file of questions that formulated the brain, and it puts them into layers that are stored in the darkness "under the level of consciousness".
Neocortex, gray brain cortex, asks for older evolutionary services, goes to the ancient brain tree's wings.
He talks to the sledgehammers, he asks for snakes, he looks for an answer in a bird's flight, he raises his sight to the clouds on the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heavens above me.
At last, the brain is asking the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the eg metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This wood is logically and emotionally exposed and growing with trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is constantly exposed to variable presence, trying to name and understand its environment and decode important messages in an unfathomable effort.
Sometimes there are problems with overload.
Analogically - as you would "fall" PC, from the language emulator program and translators from foreign languages, you would be involved first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts you ended up in the dark green publishing biosa screens, in the basic system that runs functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between processor and operating memory, etc.
For someone who hasn't understood what this is about, I'm talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You often mention her - why exactly do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a hole.
In the context of the functional mechanisms of our thoughts, feelings and behavior - there will be a spring.
Here's a good feeling of Nietzsche: "He'd been looking into the crash for so long when he looked at it."
The real feeling is that a person is lost if all hope disappears, mentally "death" and a new quality occurs.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll give you an illustration.
Once one fell into the shade and warmed up, ran for days, months and years, he kept warm and read, and those books taught him how to swim, so to live.
He's become a melter.
Perhaps someone will help me with some of the words written by me, as they once did with Hrabal's texts.
To what extent do you think of a reader, of a specific person who will read your text?
The one who can't say anything meaningful, one calls it consciousness, another super ego, but I think it's the best thing Arthur Rimbaud described in his friend's letter:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in word and sentence formulation."
Since his early youth he has read books of ancient Czech stories, sailed in the darkness of Captain Noma, running along the Stindles in the dark streets.
After all, after all the imagination of the authors and their message, it says: "The sun is clear to the worlds of other Karl Hynka Macha."
What if the book's out there?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back of the mirror that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they're accidentally contacting me on the street and thank me for helping them with their book in some difficult life decision.
Books are actually "life" or better called "worlds".
They are encoded into the characters of letters, they bear experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we wake them up to life, we let their roots flow into the brain.
It's actually, in its own way, something forbidden in God's way - awakening more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
This is the fact that DNA is stored in spells - according to old demonic books, we are allowed magic.
After the book has been published, as it has been, a series of copyright readings awaits you.
I remember you ever loved reading.
Are you going back to it with joy, or do you feel that way after years?
I'd rather tell you that today.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic signs - they're invincible, they don't notice themselves too much, they have friendly expressions, you don't feel lonely with them.
I give an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope he is still alive) was one cornered bookkeeper (named after June), a happy buddy and a good girl bull.
At one drink, he introduced me to the individual articles of a series of readers of my book, Houstina.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown a broken, read copy of my book.
I've been in a desperate state for a few hours, and I've just been in the middle of a broken morning, and I've just been in the middle of a man's cry.
We all stood there and we kneaded and we drank with our dick.
Then the young blonde man couldn't stand it, and he jumped his head out of the window into the snowflake.
It was on the ground.
We ran out into the night landscape and pursued a happy stream of sensers, the pain of the soul of landscapes, and the fate of the fallen owners - they went out and moved like wolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and substantially different from those before.
Does it also apply to the wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind the Rivers and the Mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of the human healer the words of one old Russian baja: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog lying on it. There's a trolley on it.
Horror, fear, mystery.
It's never happened, but we all know it somewhere.
Maybe we've been devilish in hell a long time ago and we've been trying to figure out what role we're going to play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on a free stream of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
The vast and unmistakable, similar movement of continents on the planet affects our desire from such a depth and in such a wide extent that it completely surpasses our perception - and thus, of course, we are doing exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded with dopamine, endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to get married, die in defense and get new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a breakdown, and we're gonna get a feeling.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - biological robot is already full of various disorders, it's standing on the coast of the ocean of unawares and in the hole of a dusty cap caught waves of the wind.
I have to write so I can be human.
Obama Gets Away From Health Care
After criticism, President Obama withdrew from his frequent and ambitious promise yesterday that "if you like your health program, you can leave it".
With hundreds of thousands of notifications of statements from the Republican suppliers in recent days, the president has been accused of misleading the American public.
Yesterday Obama broke his original promise.
"A great majority of people with functioning health insurance can leave them," he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of what he called "a riot in the media" about statements, Obama called on the Americans who received these notifications to search for new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 per cent of the population who have bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Care Act.
"I say this to those Americans on a level: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in his statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who is overseeing the implementation of the Law on Available Care, said that the Internet market was "poor" since October.
"I am disappointed and angry like all the others," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sebelius, who had caught this sentence, spoke yesterday to the council sitting behind her at yesterday's Committee's meeting, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who was concerned about whether she herself should be involved in Obama's care programme.
More than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the "architect" of the Law on Available Care did not voluntarily give up the government of sponsored insurance and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which now forces millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the proceedings, and according to the most diverse sources from the agency and from the background, there is already a hand in the handle.
The transaction notification should take place in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for the LTE network, i.e. before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
This was released under the Sazka Telecommunications brand to increase the frequency for the LTE network.
And for a general surprise, by that time the taste of the company had not penetrated into telecommunications.
But Sazku is now running a very experienced telecommunications dog Robert Chvatal.
He began as a marketing chief of Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovenian T-Mobile and was last head of the Austrian side of the same operator.
Sazka's playing a few karats at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she's admitting she wants to start virtuals at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in auction, it will be able to move already existing customers from its own virtual operator into its network.
This would probably not be desirable under the normal circumstances of Vodafone, but according to the economic news, it could be part of much more close cooperation between both companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from a competition agreement between O2 and T-Mobile operators who will fully share their network.
That's how water phones need a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in a trend on the LTE network (as a newcomer may have a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to be allowed to auction at all, or it will not interfere with the extraction of only a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone with Sazko can be shared over the network.
Vodafone lets Sazku into its 2G/3G network (respectively a newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing companies to quickly start the network.
The kit will begin to build a load network of LTE, which will be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be happy.
Then Vodafone could lose money as a provider of a fixed internet or cable TV.
What about Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovenian O2 (Slovenian branch is a daughter of Czech) immediately obtain a fully valued operator with still good profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mole that's gonna wait for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would get Kellner behind the O2 and very likely in co-operation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that networks will be shared.
The auction could finally be successful, but probably not enough with the high amounts that the state budget is looking for.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárk.
Or two titans of the Czech business against the global economy.
Will the Czech TV ever go around without signing?
In the age of President Zeman, it is not difficult to listen to complaints that gather the documents of the opposition of the castle family.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Durdík has not been documented so as to sign it.
The truth is, the editors have stopped driving.
However, the cases described do not answer the question, from which such a tendency of some journalists to landowners is taken - whether it is a response to the direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of a lack of empathy.
And now that we are assuming general perplexity, the question cannot be answered as to whether the change in television conditions is not the result of other unscrupulous power interests that have not yet been given an opportunity.
The truth is, in developed countries, people say that no attempts to interfere with the broadcasting policies will occur.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there would be no complaints to the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this stage of civilization yet, and we don't have this situation.
But maybe in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of an untransparent situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings affects itself.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: the presidents of the country of force
It is almost a rule that, in key circumstances, there was no head of state in such a way that it could fulfil its state obligations.
If T. Masarik were physically and mentally younger in five years, the end of his presidential period and the events around Munich would have been a little different.
We would probably not win the war, but after symbolic resistance, flight could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could rush to London immediately and not work there for its legitimacy.
And most of all, he wouldn't have a cotton nation until today.
Benes wasn't a stateman, and he was still in the state of Munich, but in the war, he started going up the hill and in February 48 he was on his own.
Being on something better, he could have gone to exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their puppies.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They chose him by saying, "Mr. President won't get into the situation to decide."
But he had to, even though the big decision with Hitler's neck knife was probably not in the office.
The head of research František Moravec said in the last days of March 1939 that everything should be done so that the occupation he knew on the exact day did not come to the Germans so smoother and with such gain.
The Senal president and the rescue government did nothing, but they didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human concern of Gottwald had him fix his summer allies, as Moscow had ordered him.
The Svoboda man was definitely unable to participate in normalization and had to sit down, which is quite selenial.
That Husák was a powerless and sick depressed elder of the event in November 89, but that's the only deposit.
Havel was lucky he hadn't met him in the office in the last few years, was saved by the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his duties make him think that thinking processes are no longer what they used to be.
And now we have this.
The head of state and the commander of the armed forces look like they look and we don't know everything.
Luckily, now there is no danger of the Republic's external threat.
Or maybe it's a threat, it's just not like that.
Then the question is whether it is not exceptionally ( historically) good that the President is not quite at the helm.
It's not normal.
Can we not once again elect someone acceptable to think and to be healthy in this country?
Remote planets, black and white movies or a little fantasy about alien life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter would play icedy.
In the concept of his quartet, which will end this year's annual festival of Struna in the large hall of Lucerny on 6 November, which is all related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophoneist Wayne Shorter are the current feelings of musicians.
According to his tasks, two generations of young colleagues have what they just enjoy.
They approach music as a fully improvised chamber affairs and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is freshly 80-year-old Shorter - the extraordinary composer, the wearer of nine Grammy, a former associate of Miles Davis and today's most apparently living jazz saxophoneist - does not like to explain.
He doesn't talk too much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my 80s, I felt that it was best to let my life be a surprise.
"There are too many people planning everything and then they're disappointed when things develop differently," says Shorter.
How the mowers from Thailand raised the markets of the Paris bar
Maybe you're on your knees, but you don't know that you're going to dream about half a kilo of it every year.
For example, it's broken in the can.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and you have also taken care of a unique experience.
The offer of butter was arranged as the first in Paris on the food card of his company at the beginning of October, Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the bar Le Festin Nu.
Bar, whose name was the inspiration book William Burroughs Nahý lunch, would find in the 18th fashion district near Montmartre a visited tourist.
With a fresh avocado, baked red peppers, apricots and eggplants, guests can taste not only different larvae, cows or watermelons but also four.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (to avoid damage to the body wings, to avoid bending legs or to avoid damage to the eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it's common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the progress menu will immediately state several reasons why to consume just the butter.
The first is the ecological benefit, because the production of moisture is much less expensive for our planet (for finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, moisture is an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," said Daviron to the Reuters station.
At the same time, the young chef does not stop his profession, he simply sets out to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, a feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating new experience," he explained.
Far from everyone would probably get a glimpse of how a brooch of finely decorated peaches consumes, but the response of Paris bar customers to served moisture is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics eventually taste, even though they start with the smallest systems and finally choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyás: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction has been facing a steady decline in the volume of contracts and the state is not committed to addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Economy programme was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the measures have been implemented, will reduce significant amounts for heating, but also for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Every billion invested will bring the state more than 2700 newly created jobs.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the State, there are significant package and multiplication effects, which are also one of the most important growth measures.
Therefore, the association of business in construction in the PRC does not, in principle, agree with the Government's resolution and calls for such steps to be taken to allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be identified within it.
LAW, 1 November 2013
Dog shrunk the blanket, the president buried and finished the beers
President Miloš Zeman left a motorcycle hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed and went to the castle in Lánech.
What's her health condition?
In his unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that the American spy "was too far away"
John Kerry pointed to changing the U.S. defence position with regard to his monitoring programmes and, in his unprecedented recognition, said that in some cases the spy "was too far away".
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also acknowledged that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a "autopilot" in view of the alleged detection of NSA's spying activity, which was revealed by informant Edward Snowden.
Public information caused a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said through video-connection at an open government conference in London: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government have really learned about some things that are being done out of neutrality, because this was the possibility, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of cold war and then of course 11 September."
So he became the first highly established member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. spy had crossed the border, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases it went too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and explain it to people and is now conducting a thorough review so that no one will feel that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA's efforts to do good and that its monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves. ”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill and throw people into the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from being blown up, and people from being repaired because we can already learn about these plans ahead.
The chairman of the Senate on European Affairs said on Thursday that US lawmakers are going to Europe to respond to the concerns of foreigners who are concerned with alleged American espionage, and convinced Europeans that they must continue to join their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participation in counter-terrorism organisations because they were disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important for Europe to remain on a single ship with us, and in view of the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, he said in a discussion with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee on European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism despite their involvement in NSA programmes.
The media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, although the Agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the incomprehensible metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery was quoted as quoting documents from Snowden that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other 34 world leaders.
The national news director James Clapper defended the spying of the allies as necessary and said that he was one of the two sides on the common issue.
In the middle of the call, Murphy said that his office was planning a parliamentary path to be carried out this year and hoped that members of both sides and chambers would appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators who intend to engage shall be published in the following days.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to help improve relations, he added that they would also be prepared "goodly changed educational measures".
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people as far as spying programs are concerned, which they have been using for years.
"As we adjust our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize that we are not the only ones who carry out spying here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is planning this weekend towards the Middle East and Poland to respond to the inanimateness that has already led to the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the U.S. monitoring activity.
Australia appealed to stay in Thai prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment on Phuket Island, when she wrongly claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released for bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially accused by a national court on June 15 on the island of Phuket of guilty when the Thai police said that a taxi driver along with two other men who had just detained her was attacked in early hours on Sunday, June 10.
However, the record from industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The P.D. on Phuket had a two-day interview with Bamford before she found out that she had an accident.
Prior to the trial, she was held in a local police station.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in the correctional facility with a low guard on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being put in jail for adult women.
He is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who in the case of his daughter asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had “extreme concerns” about their daughter’s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult time, but we hope that it will return to us as soon as possible in safety," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 bakhts.
Reports from Australia indicate that in the meantime she spent her vacation in the recreational area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to court proceedings which would increase her sentence and lead to imprisonment for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian employee Michelle Smith's travel office in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix a deranged image for tourists, which may have been a liberating verdict.
I made a joke, "Got out of the broom"?
In the defense zone, there was a crack and no one caught him.
In addition, the escape changed after a fast forward call.
Jaromír Jagr thus scored against Tampea on Wednesday night, then on Thursday night 119th winning goal in NHL commented on social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobod called the Director of the Czech Dragons and asked him if I shouldn't be interested in advertising on their most modern Pendolino train!" he wrote at the beginning with a hit Jágr.
I think we're kind of much alike.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish my night training so I can't get any faster.
"I'm afraid he could then call the Defence Minister and want to make an ad on a hitchhiker!" added the smiles.
In addition, New Jersey signed a second victory in a row.
"And above all, you've noticed--the treatment of Maria Rothtro is taking," the Jagr said.
Place of invitation of the candle goulash
The political elections were more than the winners brought a bunch of defeated.
It is not only the parties who did not even get into the Constable (e.g. SPOZ) but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally ČSSD because of their internal breakdown.
Politicians, instead of Christmas candles, served us on the weekend of the election gulavas.
The move of Andreje Babi, which promised the voters to change the current political style of the government, was a leap.
The break-up of the election result and the break-up on the winning side record political (for) Mr. Milos Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, which the President Zeman publicly supported, did not even vote in the parliamentary House.
The President, however, has lost strategic momentum in front of other policies because of the unpleasant event, but he still has several ways to get it back - for example by selecting the future prime minister.
While ČSSD takes the chance to get the first chair in my eyes, businessmen Andrey Babish are approaching.
The electoral development has so far been far away from the rapid and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD-supported communists, this development is only a better report for businesses in the Czech Republic and the economy.
Due to the vocal resistance of the UN to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the ČSSD, UN and KDU-ČSL coalition (a total of 111 MPs).
In view of the collapse in the ČSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations may be enough for the ČSSD.
The Minority Government of ČSSD, composed of "non-zemanovs" in the City, is probably not going through.
In addition, any government to which ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats who can lead to another conflict on the side sooner or later.
So I'm asking myself, "Can't we make another early election on our own?"
Other elections would already be more of a referendum on the force of the UN's volition mandate.
The ČSSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, the significant increase in revenue tax or the construction of the state bank are to be hoped for under the table.
The ČSSD, UN, KDU-ČSL and Úzvat agree, for example, on support for business, medium fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on support for the employment of disadvantaged persons, on the reduction of the lower VAT rate on the selected goods.
Third areas are the most common in terms of social policy and state size.
But now the UN has a proposal, so the program is the most likely coalition of the UN, the ČSSD, the KDU-ČSL would be more involved in transport.
From my point of view, it's a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything that's still moving in the economy.
