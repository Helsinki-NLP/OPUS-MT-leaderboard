Members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they will be “associated with maps”
Some of the CHA is intimidating the recommendation to change the name of their position to "Member of the Wells Parliament" (MWP).
This recommendation was based on plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament Wells.
THE entire political spectrum is concerned that this can cause laughter.
One CHA of the labians claimed that his group was concerned about the Roma from Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wells: in the Welsh word "twp" it means "unreasonable", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
A.K.A. from Wells said that his group was “not satisfied ” and offered alternatives.
One of the oil conservators said that his group was "unprecedented" about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "map".
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing legislation to change the names, noted: "The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves."
Since 2017, the Wells Self - Control Act has given the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the name of the assembly in Parliament was widely supported.
With regard to what is called the CHA, the Commission proposes to call them members of the Wells Parliament, that is, WMP, but MWP has received the largest public support.
Of course, the CHA offers alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement can cause problems for the head of Elena Jones, who has to submit a bill of change for several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
THE final vote on their new name will be held when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the election announces whether to change the country’s name to “North Macedonia. ”
The vote was organized to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that their northern neighbour's name is a claim on Greece's territory, and repeatedly opposed Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to holding a referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say that changing the name is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's calls are silent because Harlem's churches are experiencing difficult times.
“The old people I was talking to say that there was a bar and a church here before, ” says Mr. Adams.
Now there's nothing else."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"Today, people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the local hospitality where they go regularly. ”
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the leaders expect, and “early or late they will be found where they started. ”
The churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the saints who remain nearby.
“ The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white, ” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches close, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will be their descendants.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St.
The Korean white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community that held the rites near the center of the building was granted the right to property.
Saint Martin went to a black community under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotts of fragmented traders on 125th Street, Harlem's main trading street, and they didn't want to hire blacks and raise them in service.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to restore it and set up a carilion.
Presumptuous David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the Carolion "poor bells".
An expert who played in the Caribbean in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “unchangeable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first in the world to be played by a black-skinned musician Dionysius A. Lind, who turned 18 years ago to a larger carilion in the Riverside church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, in Saint Martin, he had no replacements.
What's happening in Saint Martin over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and subcontractors, some of whom were engaged by church leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
In July, the Council, a governing body of the parishioner leaders, wrote to the yeparchy that was concerned that the yeparchy would "try to hand over the expenses" of the council, when the council did not take part in the recruitment of the architects and subcontractors sent by the yeparchy.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the parishioner.
Acula was traumatized by a 13-year-old boy who went after the Lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. at Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been dating friends for nearly half an hour when he heard the boy was crying for help, and he and the group flew to him to get out of the water.
Hammel first thought it was just a thrill to get a lobster caught, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've had a taste!
They have made me taste.
As soon as he got to the boy, he found that his key was completely broken.
"I called out to everyone to get them out of the water, saying, 'In the waters of the shark!'," Hammel added.
The boy was delivered to the Children's Hospital at Radi in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that made the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Jails, in a briefing for the media, said that a few weeks ago the shark was spotted in this area, but it was found that it did not refer to the dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had been injured in the upper part of the skull.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities closed access to the beach at Ponto, Casablanca, to Swami, Ensinitas, for 48 hours.
Giles noted that more than 135 sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams using cosmetic islands similar to those in universities.
As part of an enhanced exit to the British cosmetics market at the cost of 2.8 billion pounds of sterling (continues to increase when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods decreases) increased cosmetics islands will be protested in 11 shops across the country.
The investment in cosmetics is that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the police space that used to be used under television, microwave ovens and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they said they would double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will get more space: there are brand zones like those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the cosmetics range of Boutique: now most of the products presented will not be protested on animals, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the retailer of Fragrance Shop's perfume protests his slots in two Sainsbury's stores: the first slot opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second opens in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small shops forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Kupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like universities, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl discounters using more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's opens Argo's departments in hundreds of their stores, also opened up a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that this increased sales of food and also made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to update the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals department failed.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but she ended up arguing about how to divide the revenues from monkeys into supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who would be able to give advice.
The range of brands presented to us is called to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones was "stranged" because Holly Willowby made the deal worth 11 million pounds of sterling.
The Light Dragon Star Peter Jones is "scattered" because TV show Holly Willowby has come out of agreement with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is 11 million pounds of sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowbie doesn't have time for the brand of home clothes and Truly accessories.
The business was linked to the Goop Gunet Peltrow brand.
The 37-year-old leader of this Morning's program announced his entry into Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones' Light Dragon star to the story when she finally got out of their profitable business for life to focus on new comfortable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Jones was "stranged," when a golden girl from the television showed up at a busy meeting on Tuesday at the Johns Business Empire headquarters in Marlowe, Bakingamshire, that her new deal worth 1.5 million pounds of sterling means she doesn't have enough time to dedicate it to their joint brand of household clothing and accessories True.
This business was linked to the Goop Gunet Peltrow brand and had to double Willowby's stock, which is valued at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowby reported in Instagram, coming from True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his homes for rest.
The source reported: “Truly, no doubt, was Holly’s top priority.
He was to become her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to get out of business shocked all the interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, almost a day before the launch.
In Marlow's headquarters, full of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of this morning leader, one of Britain’s highest - paying stars, could have cost millions of firm investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes) and created further delays at the start.
This can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowbie and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willowbie and Capp created True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as the head of the government in March.
The money was spent together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV company.
Willowby will become an ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Anthony McPartlin as leader of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source, close to Jones, said last night, "We won't be commenting on his affairs."
A rough conversation, “and then we fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism he received from the news media for a comment that would be considered "unpresidency", as well as for a very positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
"Why did President Trump go on such a big deal?"
Tramp said, imitating the voice of the news leader. —
I didn't go any further."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have gone into the deaf.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "response" from the United States for its first steps in disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the United States continued sanctions aimed at supporting pressure.
While giving a talk at his meeting, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results: the completion of the missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American military personnel home.
He also protected his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave as presidents, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle of the hit stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the islands, hundreds of deaths
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboka population have been affected, the national disaster has not been declared, and this is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they are not seeking international aid, so it’s a bit difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although "Save Children" is gathering a team to travel to Palau, it is not known whether foreign personnel can work on the spot.
Mr. Soutopo, representative of the national disaster management agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Pala to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unrelentingly unscrupulous in its nature.
In the province of Aceh, caves are built from the tsunamis, but they are not typical of other shores.
The apparent absence of the tsunami warning siren in Paul, although the warning was effective, probably contributed to the death.
Moving between many Indonesian islands is not just the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lomboca for the treatment of earthquake victims swims to Pala, but at least three days later it is possible to reach the site of a new disaster.
President Joco Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure on the basis of his election campaign and has increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the lack of funding created problems for Mr. Joco's administration, which is planning to be converted next year.
Mr. Joco is also concerned about the duration of an interconfessional enemy in parts of Indonesia, where Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The police called for people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "Research at the early stages now, but I ask everyone near John Street in Birkenheid to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially the taxi drivers who could take something off on the video recorder, to contact us, because information on these videos can be very important for our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenheid and was found in the house.
Today, in the second half of the day, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask where they found her this morning.

The statue of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from "historic rewriting"
The withdrawal of the statue would be due to the destruction of many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England, which were carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Creek's proposal "the stupidity" and "the attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “In view of the current debate on the withdrawal of the statues, what the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would be a target was inevitable. ”
An iconic war during the English civil war did not take place either by Romwell himself or by his command.
Likely, Cromwell will not be worthy of sacrifice for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of the sculptor William Hamo Thornichroft is a testimony to the moods of the 19th century and part of the character's history, which many think is still worth respecting.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many who are probably more likely in the late 19th century than they are now considered to be the protector of the parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Is such an idea entirely accurate — the subject of the ongoing historical debate?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be noted and respected."
The killer pig has killed a Chinese farmer to the point of death
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the name of Yuan, was found dead in blood with a broken artery next to a plumber on the market in Liupanshui, Guycheau, reported the newspaper South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In China, China, on May 30, 2005, pigs are about to immunize pigs in pigs.
It is reported that in the middle he went out with his twin brother from the neighboring province of Young to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the door of the lodger was open.
The brother noted that there was a large shed of blood in the piggy.
The forensics expert confirmed that the 249-kilogram cabin had taken the farmer to death.
"My twin brother's feet were in blood and were turned into blood," said a twin brother named Wu, quoted as Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera showed that John entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Joanna or his twin brother.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent its attack on people.
It is reported that I am the seven Yuans and the administration of the market are discussing compensation for his death.
Even rarely, however, cases of pigs ’ attack on humans have been reported earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and injured a man in a fatal injury.
Ten years before that pig weighed 295 pounds [295 kg], she kept a Welsh farmer pressed into the tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After his own pigs were eaten by a farmer from Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to the CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a "triger".
"They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect, ” he said.
The remains of the Hurricane Rosa bring widespread floods to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is deteriorating, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had wind speeds of 137 kilometers per hour (this category 1 hurricane) at 5 a.m. on the east of Sunday and was 620 kilometers south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, it begins to form a moisture that moves east to the west coast of the United States, and when it approaches the Gulf of Lower California as a tropical storm, it begins to push a strong tropical humidity north to the south west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm [25.4 cm] of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the nearest days, a tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching rainstorm will create strong floods in the southwest.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm [10.2 cm] of rain will cause dangerous floodwaters, garbage streams, and the possibility of desert shifts.
Strong tropical humidity will increase the number of rainfalls by 5-7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwestern region, especially in the vast area of Arizona.
Raindrops are possible when conditions are severely deteriorated because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
We urge you not to go to the desert of the footpath, for there may be tropical floods.
The heavy rain can make the canyons blush, and the thunderstorms and dust storms will be brought here.
The approach will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of wastes can exceed 1.25 cm, which can cause insurmountable waste streams and shale roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical torrents will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and at night on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
The strong rain will go over the For-Corners from Tuesday through the middle.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. territory can be observed, as the Arctic is getting colder, but tropicals remain quite warm.
At times, this results in a sharp drop in temperature at short distances.
A fine example of a sharp drop in temperature in the central U.S. can be seen on Sunday.
It's almost a 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Mouns, Iowa.
During the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and expand.
It is expected that a large area of central and eastern America will be warm until October, and the temperature from southern levels to some parts of the north east will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long - range weather forecast, there is a high probability of rising average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have observed the Brett Cavano case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of the candidate for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which was probably in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted the planned programs to report on Friday's latest news: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Fleke, on the F.B.R.'s one-week prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavano was drinking it and trying to get her clothes off at a party at the senior school.
In his emotional testimony, Kavano said that he was 100 percent convinced that it was not.
It's quite likely that more than 20.4 million people watched this Friday, as Nielsen's research company reported.
The company calculated average audiences CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to obtain numbers on other networks, which also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems with measuring the number of people watching TV in the office.
For comparison, this audience of size is similar to an audience that looks at the playoff game or Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose leading show of thought strongly supported Cavano’s assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the day’s hearing, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, recorded in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to representatives of Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central character of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he was going to vote for Cavano, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS recorded how protestors were shouting at Flake when he was trying to get on the elevator to hear from the Court Committee.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes, while he was being lashed in a straight air at the CNN.
"I am standing right in front of you," said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority over many women, and you have no authority over them."
Fleke reported that his office had published the application and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more to the hearing committee.
All cables and broadband channels broadcast directly hours later when the Court Committee had to vote on the candidacy of Kavano to vote to the Senate in full.
Fleke said he'd do it, only if he knew that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which a democratic minority requires.
Flega was partly convinced of the discussions with his friend, Senator Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kuns and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Fleke’s election had an impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to appoint the Kavano candidate without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of "games in politics" around Brexit
In an interview of Sunday Times Prime Minister Teresa May accused her of criticizing her plans for leaving the European Union in "politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview that came next to Teresa's interview on the first page of the paper, former foreign minister of her government Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Checkers Plan on Brexit, saying that to propose Britain and the EU to collect the fees of each other "absolutely absurd".
Shooter at Wade Sims: Police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspecting the death of a player at Louisiana State University
The police arrested a suspect in a gunshot that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for murder in the second grade, said the Baton-Ruz police department.
The authorities published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to an affiliated CBS radio station WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they had Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was awarded a deposit of $350,000.
The Coroner's office of East Baton-Rose published a previous report on Friday, which states that death is the cause of a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the Special Unit for seeking refugees from the state of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Lab, the South University Police and the local public for the aid of the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “earnestness and desire for justice”.
She was 20 years old.
The 198 cm foreward grew up in Baton-Ruz, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
In the past season, the average result was 5.6 balls and 2.6 pickups.
On Friday morning, basketball coach at Louisian Will Wade State University said the team was "lost" and "astounded" by Wade's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," Wade said.
Volcano Throws Ash Into Mexico
The dust that throws out the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Natural Disaster Warning Center called for Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater began to operate and 183 gas and ashes were registered in 24 hours.
The center has been tracking numerous noises and currents.
The picture in social media shows thin layers of ashes on a lobe of cars in the areas of Mexico, such as Chemielko.
Geophysics have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 45 miles (72 km) to the southeast of the capital after a 7.1 - ball earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police met with Catalan separatists before the polling year for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors who are taking their stand for independence met with the Special Police Department, and thousands of people joined the protestors' demonstrations to mark the first year of Catalonia's vote on division.
The proseparatist group in the masks held by the specialists cast them with eggs and a powder paint that created dark dust clouds on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used a stick to stop the attack.
A few hours later, a group of independence supporters who were scandalizing "Let's not forget, let's not forgive!" met with supporters of the country's conservation who were shouting, "Let's live Spain!"
According to a local press report, fourteen people were helped by the mild injuries they suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1st referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which is marked by Catalan separatists, the tension in the region that wants independence remains high.
The voters decided largely to vote for independence, but the appearance was low because most of those who opposed the division were boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in a violent battle last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polls throughout the region.
The independent groups spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but another route was forced.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy that they can vote, but now we’re in a deaf corner, ” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory of the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties that stand for independence failed to preserve the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary expulsion or imprisonment for their participation in the referendum and further declaration of independence.
Hoan Pugh, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a protest to support the police on the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who is in a search engine at the end of last year, announced that next year he will be fighting with the European Parliament.
"The status of the candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
London: The men were arrested after the car went into the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after the car went into London several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Crecent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noticed that the door and the house were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was fired from the Arbelat.
Hit Mengy secured Lvivington's victory over Rangers with score 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Mengi in Lvivington became a winner
The high-ranking Lionston class shocked Rangers and brought Stephen Gerard a second 18-game defeat as the manager of the Eibrox Club.
The Dolly Menge hit proved decisive: the Harry Holt team rose to one level in a second from "Hibernian".
The Gerard team didn't get any victory in the Prime Minister of this season, and next week it plays with the Harts leaders, from which it stands at eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will be admitted to Rapid Vienna on Thursday under the European League.
In the meantime, Lewiston continues his invincible move to six games in the division, and coach Holt has not yet suffered defeat since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
"Livingston" misses the chances that the guests are missing.
The Holta team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they were killed, because their straightness creates Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but he hit the door, then Alan Litgou broke through the door after he pushed and took Craig Halkett's hit along the door he made his head.
The masters were satisfied that they had allowed Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
A decisive target was killed.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Lionston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson took over Mango, who took the ball and killed him from the criminal center.
At this stage, Rangers were dominated by ball ownership, but the protection of the owners of the fields proved to be unbreakable for them, and the doorkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not concerned.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike Kelly.
The impact of Scott Pittman on his feet was reflected by the Rangers, Allan McGregor. Litgou struck through the door in another standard combination of Lionston.
The ships were constantly flying into Lvivington and constantly neutralized, and two applications were rejected after the Halkett attack on Glenn Midlton, who had been replaced, and by the game.
Livingstone phenomenon: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and the Lewingstone result.
They all played very well together, and they continued to surpass the expectations of this eastern trajectory.
Their style of play and composition has not changed after returning to the highest level, but it is necessary to give Holta the right way to mobilize the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played great, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the guidance of Gerard, but now they are not very close to those standards.
They didn't have enough of the last ball -- only once they broke through the defense of the owners of the fields -- and it was something like an awakening for the Rangers, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdogans received in different ways in Celenia
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They raised some issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kelna to open up a huge new sword.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
From the security point of view, the police did not allow 25,000 people to meet in front of the mosque, but many of the President's supporters appeared close to see him.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many Kurds among them — also forced themselves to hear, condemning Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the inconsistency of the guest, whom some German Turks call a hero and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: a bicycle driver died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the crossroads of Bestuud Street and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area in the southeast of the city about 10:15 a.m. after British standard time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died.
This accident happened a few months after another biker died after he ran out of his adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday accident.
The London police reported that they were working on establishing a man to inform his closest relatives.
The road is banned and bus routes are changed, and car drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Trapped in Disorders
Six prison staff were injured as a result of the men's incarceration, the prison administration reported.
The confusion in her Long-Lartin prison in Woostershire began at about 09:30 in the British standard time on Sunday and still persists.
To stop the disturbances initiated by eight prisoners and located in one wing, a special section called "Tornado" was called.
The officers were given medical assistance in connection with the slight facial injuries they received at the scene.
A prison official commented: "In order to resolve the incident in the custody of Her Long-Lartin, specially trained prison personnel have been involved.
Six employees received medical help in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their length of stay outside the castles can be extended."
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was sent to the station after the arrest.
In October last year, a special police department was called into prison to stop serious disturbances in which prisoners were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floodwaters.
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remnant of the Hurricane Rosa are heading through the southwest of the desert, creating the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flooding on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest estimates of the National Hurricane Centre, in the Mogollon-Rime area in Arizona, it is estimated from 5.08 to 10.16 cm and from 15.24 cm to 15.24 cm of rainfall.
Other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of rainfall, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, the rain of Rose can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although the oceans are a very serious problem, some of these torrents are likely to be useful because the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitoring Centre, some 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in force at the maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km/h from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km/h.
The storm is meeting with colder waters in the Pacific and is thus weakening.
Thus, it is expected that when a tropical storm strikes day or night, the hurricane will cause a drought in Mexico.
The number of wastes in some parts of Mexico may be significant that poses a significant risk to the oceans.
"The total number of rainfalls from Lower California to north-west Sonora is expected to range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will continue through Arizona and arrive late at night on Tuesday morning at South Juta.
"The main danger expected from Rose or its remains is very heavy rains in Lower California, North-West Sonoria and in the Southwest of the American Desert," reports the National Hurricane Centre.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening floodwaters and waste streams in the deserts as well as droughts in the mountainous region.
An attack on Midsomer Norton: four people arrested who were intent on murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspecting murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with a knife wound.
The early adolescent was found in the area of Ex-Axelsior Terras in Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 a.m. at the British standard time on Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remained in stable condition.
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Aveon and Somerset reported.
The police are asking everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says that the Kavano "tolerated arrogance and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and insulting tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp said at a meeting in Wilingo, West Virginia.
Tramp said that Kavano was "suffering and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the suspension process.
Kavano witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, inseparably and emotionally rejecting Christine Blaise Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual violence against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing of the charges brought against her.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "the American people saw the lightning, nature and courage" of Kavano.
"The voice of Judge Kavano is the voice of one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, the lawyer with an unparalleled experience of the state service," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president repeatedly mentioned Kavano’s expulsion when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans in the middle of the elections.
"In five weeks there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t run, but I really run, ” he said. — Matt.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the democratic mission was to “resist and prevent. ”
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavano's candidacy will take place no later than Friday, CNN told one of the Republican leaders.
Hundreds of people have died of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of victims increases
At least 384 people have died, many have been washed away in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunamis on the island of Sulawesi, the country’s authorities declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in Pala on Friday, when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) in the sand broke down on the shore, beating many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunamis occurred after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 balls.
"When the tsunamis were threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach, and they didn't immediately start running away, and they became victims," said a briefing in Jakarta Sotopo Purvo Nugroho, representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency (BNPB).
"It wasn't just tsunamis, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on the dry," Nugroho said, adding that before it hits the shoreline, the tsunamis passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To save himself from the tsunami, some people went to the trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerophotos published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been torn down and destroyed, and bridges have been surrounded by water.
The raids in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is at the end of the long, narrow bush, could contribute to the strength of the tsunamis, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage “wide - scale ” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without a message.
Nugroho noted that the victims and damage could be more than 300 km (190 km) along the shoreline north of Pala in the area called Donggal, which is closer to the episcopal of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn’t get any information,” said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross, and its personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot bigger," says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a broad criticism of the fact that it did not report that the tsunami had hit Paul, although officials said that the waves had come at the time of the warning.
In the amateur frames that people shared in social networks, it is evident that a man on the top of the house is making crazy warnings about the approaching tsunamis on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall fell to the shore, taking the building and the car with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the reality of the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a serious power outage, which has broken the connection around Pal, which has complicated the coordination of rescue operations.
Military personnel began to send cargo from Jakarta and other cities, reported the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other essential items.
The airport was opened only for help, and it will be closed by October.
President Joco Weidodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Workers of the World Vision organization from Donghala have well reached the city of Pala, where they are hiding in brisente tents located in the court of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, Mr. Doseb said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that workers of foreign humanitarian aid with great experience would not be allowed to go to Paul.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel abroad can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared to be a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the provincial level, ” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but this status until it's given."
The second night had already fallen on Paul after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found were still expected to see their loved ones become a miracle that would impress these clouds to bring about natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers received a woman who lay under a stone for two days along with her mother’s body.
Hendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian National Paraplanning Team, trained two missing paraplanners to participate in the Asian games that were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanners who fell into the trap at Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
"As an elder in the field of paraplanism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after the news of the destruction of Roa Roa, which spread among the paraplanners community, he desperately sent a message about whatsApp to Pal’s rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were recorded only with one gray pencil, not with a double blue pencil.
"I think that means that messages were not delivered," he said.
Stealers took $26,750 while filling the ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who ran a ATM at Newport on the Levee, reports a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarty in the news.
While he was busy, another man ran back to the Brink employee and stole a bag of money to fill it.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of suspects.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police in number 859-292-3680.
Canyye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced a change to Twitter, he wrote: "Before officially known as Canye West."
The 41-year-old West was sometimes called Ye, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place earlier this morning at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album to Yandhi.
On the show he replaces Ariana Grande's singer, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the author of the show reported.
It was not just a shortcut to the current professional name, but the West used to say that the word had religious meaning for it.
"I believe that "it" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you,"” told West at the beginning of this year, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy Radio.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyon, which means "one," was cut to just Yes, it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanya is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name of Leo and Brasser Lav.
Former Westa's colleague, JJ-ZI, also experimented with the office and large letters.
Mexico President Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador promised never to use the army against civilians.
On Saturday, Lopes Obrador promised to “never use an army to suppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot a peaceful demonstration in the area, killing about 300 people, while the left student movement began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free State universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
US should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount that they spend on research in this field, considers an investor and practice in the field of Shi Kai-Fu Lee, who was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the SI, although the U.S. has no formal strategy in the field of the SI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become the No. 1 for innovations in the field by 2030.
"The initial SSI research budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the SSI," Li said.
Double funding can double the probability that the next major achievement in the field of SI will be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The State of China: the Silicone Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the Sinovation Ventures fund that invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Mello University, he worked on the SHI system, which won the best American player at Otello, and was later CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee noted the previous U.S. government-led technology struggles, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win state grants, says Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he remarked.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities to work on the ISS.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase its efforts in the field of HIV.
"I think the Green Card should be offered automatically to the candidates for science in the field of SI," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Art Intelligence of a New Generation in July 2017.
The National Fund for Natural Science provides funding to people working in academic institutions, like the National Science Fund and other U.S. government agencies handing out money to American researchers, while the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Intelligence Centre to involve partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee from the Art Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Research Fund, he is now investing in the research of US$100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create the Commission from the national security of artificial intelligence, did not take any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted on a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia", which will allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's membership of the Euro Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has put a veto on Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments entered into an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement said that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote on the referendum, and the boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether a minimum 50% voter would be reached, which would allow him to consider the referendum to be effective.
The question in the referendum paper sounds like, "Do you support NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
The name-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should be paid to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that she could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they support it to make it decisive.
There will be two thirds of Parliament's votes to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations had been received by 1:00 p.m.
However, only 16% of the polls in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 accounted for 34%, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots in the urns.
"I have come to pronounce for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Chosenman José Tanevski in Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko gave their vote on the referendum on the change of country name, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and set a table in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kvardark said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can address others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes NATO membership will bring much needed investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority voted for, as more than 80% of our citizens stand for the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the vote.
He noted that the result of “yes ” would be confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is the most necessary event.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote for.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the appearance should be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government from the start of its work in May last year.
Look, Serchio Aguero from Manchester City goes through all of Bryton's defense and kills the target.
Sergio Aguaero and Rahim Sterling went through Bryton's defense and brought Manchester City to victory with score 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal at the 65th minute of the match looked like a funny simple.
The Argentine attacker received a passport at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Briton defenders and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He walked around one of the guards, then ran a few more on the edge of the Briton.
Then he made a pass on the left, seeing Sterling.
The English foreman made the first touch on the fine to hand over the ball to Aguaro, who with his right butt let him go to the right of the door, causing the defeat of the Bryton goalkeeper to Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guard.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he killed the target right now."
But the initial advantage of the blue sky in this match of the Premier League was to provide Sterling.
This was a 29-minute goal.
Aguero got the ball deep on Briton.
He sent a beautiful penetrated belt along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touch-ups and then made a Sterling Pass in the direction of the remote stanza.
The Forvard of the Sky-Blues threw a ball into the door just before he went off the border.
"Citys" will meet Hoffenheim in the group stage of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rain Neccar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to take her eyes off Rokis
Since the Washington Nashionals team was out of playoff, there was no significant reason to wait for the round start.
But Shercer, who tends to compete, expects to go out on Sunday to fight Colorado Rockis, on condition that Rockis is still having trouble going out to playoffs.
The Rockys at least have the wild card for winning the 5-2 match over the Nashionals on Friday night, but they still want to strengthen the title of the first division.
"Despite that we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to leave the ball knowing how viewers are doing here in Denver, and another team will probably play at the highest level I've seen all this year.
Why would I not want to take part in this contest?
The Nashionals still know who's going to be the first painter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're tending to be Shercer.
The Chertzer, for which this is going to be the 34th start, took a pizza session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, usually the weekend.
The Washington right has a result of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs at 220 2/3 inches this season.
The Trumpet Meetings in West Virginia
The president repeatedly mentioned the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano when he spoke about the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the mid - term elections.
"All we've done will be put on the map in November.
Five weeks from now, one of the most important choices in our lives will happen.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so wherever I can, I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're firmly set up to restore power, using any means, you see vanity, greed.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who need to go through to get power and control, they want power and control, we don’t want to give them. ”
The democratic mission, according to him, "to resist and prevent."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad and ugly, ugly and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator-Democrat Diane Finstein on behalf of him who caused the audience to hear loud dissatisfaction.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get a document?
Uh-huh.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Liberian party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant to those who express their thoughts.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it almost turned out to be a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of those Members of Parliament who have been informed that they are not happy, and this is because we express our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was almost the same because she was determined against anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, is ironically similar to that of those who did not agree with former leaders.
The report on the meeting of Nottingham East Laborists said on Friday, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee for my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labourers were the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kind, more soft" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been realized.
It becomes increasingly evident that there are no differences in views in the Liberian Party, and each opinion is appreciated by the position that it is acceptable for the party to take the lead.
This began shortly after Jeremy became my leader, and colleagues with whom I once thought I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether nationally safe or the only EU market.
When I speak in public — and it doesn't matter what I say — this is what follows a series of social network attacks with calls for withdrawal, the central policy convictions, I'm told I shouldn't be in the Lao party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues because I've been told that I'm usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily flows of sexual or racist attacks but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “untrustworthy” or changing the rules of selection, the party is narrowed down.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been asked not to go out, not to say so loudly, so that "all was fine."
But that's not what I came for.
I joined the labyrinth 32 years ago as a school student because because of the lack of attention on the part of the Tetcher government, my class in high school has been getting literally distracted, since then I want to improve the quality of government services for those who need them the most, whether local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was disturbed by my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: under the conditions when the country goes to Brexit, which would harm households, businesses and state services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
I actually have another message, but not for the Notingham Momentum, but for my voters, both members of the Labour Party and not: I am proud of what I am serving you, and I promise that there is no danger of calling me back and no political advantage will make me act according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrose": unbeatable "Eir" rises up
The last two attempts may have distorted the outcome, but, no doubt, Air earned a triumph in today's great entertainment match to the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, it's the only unbeatable team of ten.
Finally, excellent protection and improved ability to take advantage of opportunities gives Peter Merci’s hosts and coaches the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been testing our games today, and we're still invincible, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, "I see the right "Eir," they'd better use the odds than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, carried out by Frasie Klimo, led Eir forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Guza, published by Verrows, allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo reinforced Air leadership through the Penal Service and immediately before the break, made and implemented a solo test, which gave the 17-5 account for Air.
But Melrose had a good time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was made by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which was brought out of the field on his nose, and from the Eir Restoration, they rushed forward with the experience of Stafford Mcdawell, which was realized by Climo.
Captain Air then had a yellow card, and Melrose again forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt under the hot pressure.
The masters returned, however, when Stroan Hatchinson received an yellow card for the arrest of Klimo without a ball from the criminal court line, McFerson made a tachydown behind the Air petition.
Klimo made an attempt that he did almost every time after the start, then Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong in the box and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt by the master's team.
It looks like a still-playing star set for a new career in a restaurant.
It looks like Ford Kiran's still playing star is set up for a new hospitality career, which can be concluded once it's known that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC television series, a script he's writing and filming with his former comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the future of the ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Aragingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan would like to enter the "prominent restaurant business" of Glazgo.
"Our Sea": internal matter Bolivia hopes that the court will find its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
Public buildings hang the ocean-blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are painted by the currency: “The sea is our right.
We have to get him back. ”
In Bolivia that has no way out of the sea, there's still a memory of the loss of a shoreline that went to Chile in the 19th century's bloody conflict through natural resources, and there's a desire to swim back in the Pacific.
These hopes now are probably the strongest in recent decades because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of review.
"Bolivia has an impulse, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result," commented Roberto Calsadja, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many sufferers will observe the announcement of the ICW's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a decision for Bolivia that will force Chile after decades of fragmented talks to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign way out of the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion next year, also puts great hope in the decision that will be announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision for Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little change.
The United Nations authority based in the Netherlands has no authority to condemn the territory of Chile and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
What the ICJ's decision, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case was "not difficult", said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia’s case has not been resolved, and the last four years have been able to promote rebuff.
"The question of access to the sea was used by the Bolivian administration today," Zarate said.
The warrior rhetoric of Morales undermined the remnant of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not been able to exchange messages since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations from Chile and the opportunity to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit, ” he said.
Kalsadaya also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the maritime issue as a political militia.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind. ”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the U.S.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Rei Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapon first before it can trust Washington.
Rye took the floor on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the summit in Singapore by the leaders of rival countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the way to re-launching nuclear diplomacy, which entered the deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Ri says that faith in the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the U.S. Declaration on the End of the Korean War will once put North Korea on its knees is a “implemented dream. ”
Washington is afraid to accept a declaration before Phanayan takes significant steps in disarmament.
And American President Donald Trump wants another meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that the Pyrenees take seriously the refusal of their arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
In Paris’s fashion shows, the latest trend of massive main clothing is on the main street of your city.
If you want to increase your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you've found what you need.
Valentine's and Tom Brown's designers demonstrated a number of eccentric oversizes from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the stage of a brilliant Paris fashion week.
Very impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and the designers have already sent their memorable creations beyond the stage.
Valentino's got an extravagance runaway hat with a wide range of beautified feathers that covered his head with models.
Among other accessories, they're decorated with a precious stone of a cave, a hat of a witch and even a hat of an ananas, but they're not to keep their heads warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very soon before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had protected lips and were more reminded of Hannibal Lecter than of a high fashion.
One creature resembled a underwater swimmer with a tube and eyeglasses, another appeared to be a piece of frozen ice that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Overside hats came into fashion thanks to La Bombi, a salmon hat with a width of 60 centimeters that they saw on everyone: from Rianni to Emily Ratazkovsky.
The cult brand, which stands behind a very impractical hat that was seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace another creature: a Solomonian beach bag of nearly the size of a model in the bathroom that carried it.
The sum of the yellow-red rafia with rafia and white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera collection spring-summer 2019 brand Jacquemus in Paris's weekly fashion.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "The next summer I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the impact of the designer is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is mandatory for the world's citizens
The independent schools of Scotland support high standards of education, and in 2018 the results of studies that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields have been re-enacted.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools, which aims to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and make them the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in the language she understands, she takes it with her mind.
If you speak to her in her own language, she will take it to heart. ”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s exams, we see that independent schools lead languages in the rankings of subjects with the best grades.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher A.
Data gathered at 74 NHRC schools showed that 72% of students received high A from Chinese and 72% from German students, 69% from French students, and 63% from Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, language as an object of choice is being taught in the same way as that of NTMM (scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics), through independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close their vacancies due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming more and more necessary when you prepare young people for future careers.
Since more and more promising positions are in need of language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if you learn a second language, you'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong habit.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has several languages the advantage over competitors.
According to a survey conducted by over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak in a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a double percentage (15%).
That is why investment in language teaching is now important for modern - day children.
Knowledge in several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, each school will study its language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create a educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future holds.
There is no denying now that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future country in the international business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be called “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, variety, and perfection for Scottish youths.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Schools for Independent Schools
Lebron starts with Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see LeBron James' first launch for Los Angeles Lakers almost got there.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, it's not decided yet.
"That'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, reported that James would play a limited number of minutes rather than anything.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of Lakers preseasonal graphics.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games," he answered.
Trampa meetings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is now opening a series of election meetings from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings scheduled for the following week of Trump's meetings, including meetings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy offered by him to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to support the future mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time will be the evening meeting of Trump in West Virginia today, and how can we view it on the Internet?
The Trump meeting in Wiling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours east today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the tramp meeting in West Virginia online below in the direct atmosphere on YouTube.
The tramp probably mentions the strains of hearings that have occurred this week from bringing a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate's vote for a week as long as the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans pick up their popularity before the November elections.
President Trampa's representatives said that these five meetings next week were aimed at "the activation of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to save and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congress control is so critical to his day order that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense campaign season is approaching," said Reuters, a representative of the trampa campaign, who did not want to name himself.
At the Wesbanko Arena stadium in Wiling today's meeting, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News, can come.
The Saturday visit will be the second in the last month of the trip to West Virginia, where it won more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from the Republican to the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morris, whose rating is lagging behind.
“ It’s not good for Morris to come to the president to raise his test scores, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended with a unilateral victory, Saturday afternoons could become the same thing as that of the Ryder Cube.
The urgent winner of the impulse is a fully invented sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say the pulse works?
"They were ahead at six points, and now at four, so I think we'll take it a little bit as an impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel a little bit of wind in their glasses, too much that encourages them, not least the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each has earned three eyes out of four.
The spat with his killer kicks from the tycoon to the grin shows an example.
These shrill shoutings of celebration grew louder as he continued his round made a decisive pact and leveled the score at the fourth match after he and Thomas were standing at two points.
His passport, which allowed them to win the match on 15 Mondays, met a similar scream, which tells you that the American team doesn't seem to.
"You really should just try very hard and worry about your own match," Spit said.
This is all that each of these players has left now.
18 monkeys to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spyt and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flettwood, the unmistakable story of Cube Ryder.
An unusual but charming pair from Europe has four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
"Molywood" was the only couple who did not make gods on Saturday after lunch, and they also managed to avoid Gods on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and at the last nine lunches on Friday morning.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this tumultuous crowd back and forth, makes them believe that they will win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players, other than Fleetwood or Molinars, to strengthen the potential victory of Europeans when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
He wants to be both at the same time in different holes.
However, the triumph of Europeans is still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson broke up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning forbolts when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
One god and two ladies at the first nine holes brought Spanish and Swedish to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe foreballs and foresoms closely through the interaction between the participants of the couple, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy can change at one time.
While Europe is playing better than a team and has a significant advantage in the last day, this force session has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight in which some, especially Americans, are in doubt.
Europe's leading 10-6 on the last day of Cube Ryder.
On the final day, Cube Ryder Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's morphs and forsoms it's ahead of the United States with an account of 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the remote Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four balls.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forbolts with an account of 3-1.
The U.S.A. was more resistant to forces and won two matches, but could not cut the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points in 12 week singles to save the trophy.
Flethwood is the first European novelist to win four rounds, while Mollinar (including Millwood) after the sensational exits is only the second pair to win four rounds in the first four matches in the history of Cube Ryder.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into bubbles, they joined together to defeat the old Woods and the new American Brison Deshambo with even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed random sparks of genius, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the foreballs and forsoms and seven matches below.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning spells, returned to his partner, Henrik Stanson, in the Forsoms to get a 2t-1 loss from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe couldn't do everything in its own way on this nice fresh day to the southwest of Paris.
Three major winners of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans on Saturday with their two eyes.
They won a decisive victory of 2ta1 over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Forbola and later beat Poulter and Rory Maclero with 4ta3 in the Forsoms, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cube Ryder has the team returned with a deficit to four points in the singles, although the Furik team is only needed to save the trophies.
However, after the second place for two days, the contraction on Sunday seems to be out of their power.
North Korea says "no" will not be disarmed in a unilateral order without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea announced on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions would deepen the confidence in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Rei Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that in last year North Korea had used "essential measures of good will", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, disassembly of nuclear testing sites, and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"One time, we don't see a proper reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm ourselves in a unilateral order."
And although Ri has repeated well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's "step-by" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded in step by step, his statement was important that it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Phenyan had done in the past.
Ry made a joint statement by Kim Chen In and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the summit between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim called for work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea longs for the formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Phenyan must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the call for a reduction in severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "denuclearization at first" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"To think that sanctions can put us on our knees, is the unreal dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions will deepen our confidence. ”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Mun Zhe Yin over the past five months and added, "If the issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a deaf corner."
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was very different from that of the previous one when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Tramp called Kim "a human rocket" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year in UN Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy ” North Korea last year, Kim praised the courage to use disarmament measures, but said that much more would be needed and sanctions should remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
In the middle of the tramp noticed that he didn't set the time frame for this: "Let's take it two years, three years, or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council is to reward Phenyan for the steps he has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue energetically and relentlessly until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has consistently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met Ri in the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the next month he was visiting the Pyrenees again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Phenyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea sentenced him to “gangster requirements. ”
At the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to take off the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States were to use the "relevant measures".
He said that Kim says he needs "relevant measures" are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of learning crutches all night after making caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the university number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chester, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women’s Hospital in Brigham, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after he gave a lecture on the effect of losing sleep on learning.
At the end of the day, a girl approached him and said, "Why are you telling me this at the last class?"
"She told me that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me," said a teacher from The Telegraph.
At the course that was first introduced this year, students explain the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the University, explained that the university decided to take a course after it was found that students were seriously out of sleep for a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a room in a group where students click on cups of coffee, dishes, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficit on sports indicators, and the importance of sleep-related routine.
Another section tells participants how chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior at the moment.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and he noted that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is increasing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality must be a student’s “secret weapon ” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even with a set of extra weights, because sleep deprivation translates the brain into hunger that causes constant physical hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chester develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be addressing all the graduates with a request for a similar training program to enter a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to sleep, as well as to put the building and be in a harmful influence of blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and light-emitting lamps, and which can disrupt the Circadian rhythm that causes sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengy's goal was to upset Gerard's boys
The Rangers survived a round attack of the air traffic jam: the Dolly Menga hit the different team of Steven Gerard with a 1-0 defeat from Lvivington.
The Eibrox team wanted to win its first victory in the race after the February triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but the Gary Holt team defeated Gerard as a 18-game manager. The Gerard team remained at eight points behind the leaders of the Scottish Prime Minister Harts.
Manga was killed in seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which had no inspiration, didn't seem to be able to balance the account.
Now "Rangers have fallen to sixth position, and "Livingston" has risen to third, and unlike balls, they're being promoted only by "Hibernian".
In addition, Rangers may face another discomfort, since the liner Kalum Spence was forced to process a head wound after he was dumped from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which had previously passed over Air to the upper end of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same set of lions 11 that took one eye to Harts last week, and was excited about how his excavated boys had pushed their opponents at every step.
Maybe the Rangers were dominated by a ball, but Lvivington was working more with a ball.
They were supposed to kill everything in two minutes of the game when the first Menga pass in a free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit at the door of Allan McGregor, but the semi-protector wasted this great chance by sending the ball over the door.
A deep, free hit by Keagan Jacobs reached the shipper Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Litgou hit the back of the barn
Rangers actually got control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to the penalty four hours after the meeting with Steven Loules, but the reference to Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to make only two knocks on the doors in the first time, but the former gatekeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassani Kuilibali's head and the peaceful blow of the Egeraria sheep were almost uneasy.
And even though Lvivington's goal was 34 minutes long, maybe it was a game that contradicted, no one could deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Mango to just finish.
On the break, Gerard replaced the Kulibali on Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the pinger broke into Morelos, but the amazing Kelly pulled him off his line to lock him up.
However, Lionstone continued to force guests to play the same game as they liked when Litgou and Halkett made one long pass after another.
The Holta team could have improved in the last stages, but McGregor was well opposed to Jacobs before Litgou hit the corner.
Glenn Midlton, a substitute for Rangers, made another late application for a fine when he met Jacobs, but Thompson took a look again.
Almanac: Geiger's inventor
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes William Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geigers have become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950s, the Kornodo Bells, and Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play doubters like cowboys.
The man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear how the radiation affects the atoms in the minerals."
Evans, "Well, it's really shaking right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells that are part of the treatment
Method predicts the elimination of immune cells in the patient and their changes in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to see proteins that are common to many types of cancer. Then these cells reintroduce the patient.
The test vaccine demonstrates promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches an immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells into the patient, changing them into the laboratory so that these cells can "see" together for many types of protein cancer (HER2), and then re-introducing these cells into the patient.
Professor J. Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Bethesd, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells in patients and learning them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing at the SNL show at the MAGA Kanye West baseball, he gave a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
what caused the viewers to react negatively
The viewers at the SNL Show (Saturday Night in the Straight Ephere) were lighting Cany after his summary speech, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Tramp and said he was going to fight for the presidential post in 2020.
After performing the third song called Ghost Town in baseball with the title "Return to America's Former Fame," he exploded with a tyranny in which he criticised the Democrats and again declared his support for Trump.
"How do you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The show SNL began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavano's testimony he gave to the Senate's Legal Committee on the issue of Christine Blaise Ford about violent sexual acts.
Although the West’s speech was not broadcast in the direct direction, the video with its cover featured a social network of comics by Chris Rock.
It's just hard to see if Rock wanted to smile at West by placing this post.
The West also complained to the viewers that he had been hit by an unpleasant situation because of a major stroke.
As Washington Examiner reported, West said, "When I was behind bars, I was treated cruelly.
I was told, "Don't go out to the viewers in this baseball game."
They were insulting me!
And then they tell me that I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
And he said, "You want to see where the oppressed keep quiet?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety's weekly report, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction from the audience in the hall, and the actors on the SNL show looked like they were lost.
In the last minute, the West was invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days before the show.
The West called into many surprises by performing song I Love it (I love it) in Perrier's bottle suit.
The Vesta supported the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Candes Turner, who wrote in Twitter: "One of the bravest: Thank you for what I've been up against NATO."
Instead of leading Karen Hunter's show, she wrote on Twitter that the West is "who he is, and it's just great."
"But I won't reward it (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, confesses and rejects an ideology that harms my society.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name: now he's "the one they used to know as Canya Vest."
The West is not the first performer to change his name, but he's following the example of Didi, also known as Puff Grandpa, Paffi and Pi Didi.
A colleague of the Snoop Dog earlier called Snoop Lion, and, as you know, the musical legend of the last decades of Prince changed his name to symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."
Indictment for the intentional murder after a knife attack at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after another man was stabbed in one of the restaurants in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident happened at the Belligekamor restaurant.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the court of Belfast's magistrates on Monday.
The prosecutor's office is investigating the charges.
Kitt Gerington's star's star's condemning the idealization of brutality.
Keith Gerington became famous for the role of a soldier with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of thrones" of the HBO.
However, a 31-year-old actor who condemned a hero-match stereotype, claiming that because of such heroes on screen, young boys often seem to have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said, "Something has gone wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealization of brutality in the era of the habité #MeTo (#also, #yes, etc.).
Kitt, who recently married his colleague on the Games of the thrones, 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, said he was "a pretty determined man" who was set up to deal with this problem.
"I am at this point set up pretty resolutely, when did we get on a slippery path of idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth through the prism of the problem that we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through the imagery of extremely brave heroes.
He continued, "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does TV and street teaching that young boys feel pressured to be like that?
In my opinion, today is a really important question: How do we change it?
'Cause it's obvious that the young guys are out of the way.'
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any pre- and sycamore games after the show of the next summer's show, because "he's done with battles and horses."
From November on, Keith will play the real-world game, Sam Shepard, a story about a filmmaker and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently confessed, he respected the best meeting with his wife, Rose, that he had received from the game of thrones.
"After taking pictures in this show I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my next life," Keith said.
In a fantasy series that won Emma's prize, Rose played Irrittt, a hero of Gerington John Snow.
In June 2018, a ceremony took place on the territory of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases of disease
In China, 14% of people with HIV and AIDS reported a sharp increase.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 patients are generally reported in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted by means of a sexual route that indicates a change in the past.
In some regions of China, HIV was rapidly spreading through infected blood at the time of transfusion.
However, according to official health authorities at the conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people infected with HIV fell to almost zero.
Compared with the previous year, however, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China has grown by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV on a sexual basis over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community is often discriminated against.
According to research, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are further married to women because of the country's conservative values.
In most cases, transmission of the disease occurs as a result of improper use of protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, thus partially addressing the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the anger of the Republican senators on the network by her staff and strongly criticises the "dangerous lie" and the "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, sentenced one of her staff to submit personal data to three American Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements spread "ultra-right" political viewers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then a more hateful lie," said Waters in Twitter.
Public information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch from Utah.
Data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing with the Senate commission for charges of sexual misconduct brought against Brett Kavano, a candidate for the position of Judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Some time after the three senators questioned Cavano, the data leak took place.
The Hill magazine reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, information was provided that the IP address of the source is linked to the Waters office and that it has been able to find the data of its staff member.
"These unsubstantiated statements are absolutely false, they are not true," Waters continued.
"The employee of my office, whose personal data and security are threatened as a result of these forged and false statements, has no relation to the source of this information.
These unsubstantiated statements are absolutely false, they don't fit into reality."
Waters was quickly criticised on the network, including the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Flischer.
"This denial is filled with anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that with such a nature she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not behave presumptuously.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unmoved."
It seems that Fleischer was paralleling the reaction of the Waters and the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Cavano, who was accused of looking too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party who is struggling to take over Waters in the middle election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had already reported "the relevant state authorities and law enforcement authorities on these false statements."
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they responded to the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my workers."
Review of the movie "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" - a passing parade on spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It's already a good tradition to look into every new British movie that Brexit has created. There are also in a new series of comedy parades for Johnny English fighters. The first movie called "John English" came out on screen in 2003, and later the series was re-launched in 2011 with the "John English: Restart".
Is it going to be a ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction to what we are not a debt, the new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English with his movable face and his eyelids had a second chance to make trouble, but his name is more than anything else that indicates that this comic character is made for viewers in non-English countries.
It is well known that Johnny is a fun secret agent, in which despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, is a little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bin and a lot of what – from the boy who played one note of the song from the movie "Firely Wheels" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The figure of character is also a traveler and a mystery of an international scale that has always left behind the disorder that Atkinson once played in a long - forgotten TV advertisement by Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny English, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English came up with a helicopter in the face - to - face equipment, and the gun blades were running around his helmet.
Atkinson's talent has been well-discovered, but humour is transitory, and at some point it's too much, especially when compared to "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission impossible", one of the "intruders" that is also comedy.
It seems that jokes are better for children than for adults, and I don't think the foolish attacks that happen to Johnny English are as inventive and thoughtful as those of Atkinson in no movies about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British supersecret spy network penetrates the hacker and exposes the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise for the active agent. ( Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an epic role in the film.)
This turned out to be the last drop for the Prime Minister, a proud person who has already experienced destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity. (Emma Thompson tried to convey the best image published by Theresa May, but the script failed to fully discover it).
The investigators informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to get someone away.
The choice is for Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some super-modern institution and informally teaches children operating under cover (in this part with the Spanish "year school" English for teenagers was a few distant jokes).
English is quickly delivered to Whitegol for a terminal briefing, where he meets again with his multi - suffering friend Buff, who plays Ben Miller in the back of the game.
Buff is now married to the captain of the underwater boat (the role of an exhaled nuisance does not correspond entirely to the talent of Vicki Pepperdin.
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went to schkerebrate, "Bethman and Robin" returned to power and suddenly met the fatal woman Ofelio Pistoletto, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this point, the Prime Minister is going under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his asset in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can eliminate the problem with the British network -- the miserable Jason Walt, who played Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on their journey and return to their gruesome exits: they are dressed by officers who make fires in a fancy French restaurant; then they sow chaos by illegally crossing the border on the beautiful Volta yacht; English is making a real mess when trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to get to know the planning of the Volta house.
All stops lead us to the final episode, but his kindness and folly remind us of a movie for children.
It's a passing movie.
As with other movies about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Could the British film industry not offer the role of Rowen Atkinson that really fits his talent?
Laborists refuse to prepare a plan that says the British will work for four days a week, but they will get a five-day salary.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan for British workers to work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to oblige the company's managers to transfer the costs saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an additional output.
In this way, workers will have a three - day outcome and will pay the same wage at home.
According to sources, this idea will be part of the Party's economic programme and direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The four-week shift was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions, and this is how workers can benefit from changing the overall economic situation.
The Labour Party's source reported The Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change overnight, but the idea of a four-week working week is the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labourers did not first approve of this idea, since the Green Party promised to launch a four-week work week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party today approve of this desire.
Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The political program of the party does not provide for the introduction of a four-week work week, so now we don't consider this idea."
"Tiny" Chancellor John McDonnell introduced his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election party's party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had been set up to take back authority from the "benign directors" of municipal companies and "visitors".
The chancellor's "shade" plan also means that the water supply company's shareholders can get not all their share of the capital if the laborist government executes "recalculation" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in company management and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary shares to private sector companies that expect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us at the 60-minute show, or can the investigation of the Cavano case, led by the FBI, change their mind?
In connection with the investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavano, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court is postponed for at least a week.
At Sunday's show, 60 minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked the senators of the Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.
During my hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavano.
I called him after everything happened and the charges were dropped, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was decisive, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Greem's thinking will not change anything.
"I think the embodiment of the Kavano charges is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett strongly denied everything," added Graham, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
That happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and a mission that is still under way to combat poverty worldwide.
At the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be marched into the Grand Hall of the Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendez’s talks, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival – organizers will want to combat the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international civil society organization that is expected to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a lot of tasks or "actions", like learning in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help pay attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results, because the goal of Global Citizen organizers was 12 years old?
Is it really an idea to reward for doing a free concert -- a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicking" when people feel that something is really changing by signing an electronic petition or making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "actions" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have motivated world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs of more than $37 billion, which will help to change lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group set out as an example the results of its 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the cost of living has already directly affected some 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial commitments are the The Power of Nutrition Fund, which is territorially related to Britain. As part of the project, investors and realists committed themselves to "help children grow up" and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help cope with malnutrition after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"In support of the government of Britain, the mecenants, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of malnutrition by a minor fact of history," said The Power of Nutrition Tracy Wallman, a representative of the organization, speaking before the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "actions" that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced spending on the The Power of Nutrition project to improve nutrition for 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can combat extreme poverty?"
The representatives of Global Citizen wrote: "This is a long and difficult path, so sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the civil rights and apartheid movement participants, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeannell Mona is only part of the star performers that will be performing this year at the New York Festival and will be hung by Deborah Lee Ferness and Gu Jackman.
Minister of Interior said that the US could use military and maritime forces to "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to a quote by U.S. Home Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted at Washington Examiner, Washington may use military and maritime forces to prevent Russian energy from coming out of the markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke stated that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to become a middleman in the energy trade, as they're already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the incumbent, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
"Thanks to the U.S. military forces, they can ensure free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market," he said.
Zinke is a non-commercial organization that positions itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared trade approaches with Russia and Iran, indicating that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we effectively use energy and replace it with alternative," he said, calling Russia "one-sidedly developed," because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were being made, the purpose of the Tramp administration was to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing Russian energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this purpose, the officials of the tramp administration and President Donald tramp themselves are trying to convince the German government to reject the "unprecedented" project of construction of the "North Stream 2" pipeline, which, according to the tramp, will make Berlin a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas is worth $11 billion, which doubles the passing capacity of the existing gas to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
Kremlin is convinced that Washington is strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons only, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the idea that energy cannot be a pressure tool and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany's leading organization of the German Federation of German Industry (BDI) called for the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like when a third country is involved in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "is thinking seriously" about the presidential election in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "seriously think" about voting for the president's post after the interim elections.
At a meeting with the public in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of postponing his candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up government work, and for this to happen, there must be a woman."
"After November 6th, I think seriously about putting my candidacy into the president's office."
At the meeting with the public, Warren expressed his appreciation of the presidency of Donald Tramp, saying that he "runs his country not in that direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing Trump and offering him a candidacy as a judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
On Friday's tweet Warren wrote, "...no doubt the FBI's vote should be investigated."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, the majority of Warren's voters do not believe it should be fought in 2020.
According to the survey conducted jointly by the Political Research Centre at the University of Saffolk and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the state's potential voters in Massachusetts expressed their opposition to the Senate's candidacy.
Thirty - two percent were supported by suspension.
The results of the poll showed that the former Governor, Deval Patrick, was more supportive.
During the discussion of the nominations of other well-known democrats, which can fight in 2020, they also call former vice-president Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Byden announced that he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Paylin mentions the TRTR of Trek Paylin at a meeting to support Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Payline spent the year in Iraq after his military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"The things that my son is going through right now, what he's going through after he's back, can only understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of the PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with," she said in front of the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Peelin called the Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other veterans of war "returning home not as they used to be, more cruel, and want to know if they respect what their soldiers, pilots and other military officers have done here."
According to a spokesman for the Basil Police Department, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in Basil, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, and that he was obstructing the report of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol arrest.
18 States and Districts of Colombia Support the Prosecution of the Landing Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the claim of a new U.S. policy that the victims of gang persecution and domestic violence refuse to grant refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support a call for shelter and to challenge the policy in court.
The full name of the call in Grace v. Sehns' case for an American Union for the Protection of Civil Rights, in which federal policy is being challenged and filed in August, is not being disclosed.
The caller said her partner "and his cruel sons-bands" beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for a shelter on July 20th.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support Grace’s call said that the people of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (of which refugees often seek refuge in the United States) are often faced with such serious problems as banditism and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy reverses the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, according to which non-documented immigrants who fled from domestic violence could apply for shelter.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, General Carl Reissin, said in his speech on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that the decision on the application of refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle," says the Court's analyst.
In an analysis report, prosecutors have argued that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is damaging to the economies of the country because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labour resources".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seshns issued an order to immigration judges that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing from domestic violence and banditism.
"The headline is given to those who leave their country through persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Sessens said in his presentation of the June 11 policy.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems people face worldwide every day.
The survivors desperately try to find those who are left alive, while the number of those who have died in Paul’s home has increased twice.
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a riot at the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palau.
"Every minute quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough."
Some people return to their ruined homes, take advantage of the heat, and try to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been traumatized, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 balls on Richter’s scale are overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including two Geris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the building of an army hospital in Pala, where patients are assisted under the open sky by constant repeated calls.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled how a strong rush shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I'm stuck in the cracks of the wall," said Geris to an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family came to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, and then she cried quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "implementation of psychological pressure" by "advertising propaganda"
A week after the Chinese State newspaper posted on four pages of the American daily publication advertising material about the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, a U.S. envoy in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump of the Middle Ages sent to China Daily's Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of attempting to influence the elections to Congress, which will take place on November 6th.
According to Reuters, U.S. officials, Trampa, in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to intervene in the U.S. elections, means a new phase of escalation on the part of Washington, whose target is pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place a commercial to boost trade, a escalation of trade war is taking place between Beijing and Washington in time, where they have already increased import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, China's repressive customs was intended to strike exporters from states like Iowa who supported the Republic of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, a US ambassador to China and former state governor of Iowa, China’s largest agricultural exporter, said that China had damaged American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the Sunday issue column of the Des Moines Register, "is increasing pressure by publishing advertising in our independent press."
"To spread the propaganda, the government of China is using the road for the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press, placing a pay ad at the Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"On the contrary, on the street schedules here in Beijing, you will find only the individual voices of different thinking people, and here you will not see a true picture of what the Chinese people are actually thinking about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is causing concern, so you can conclude that the media of China is under the confident control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of China's most important editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't call it what it was.
Analysts warn that by the collapse of the Kavano Republicans, female voters are setting up against themselves before the intermediate elections.
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano after several charges were brought against him in sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an undesirable reaction to the future interim elections, especially in women.
Around this situation, prejudice is rampant, and the majority of the Republicans publicly say that they would like to go to the vote.
Such things can't be played back," said Grant Riger, professor of politics at Maxwell University of Syracuse, during an interview with The Hill.
Rigger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, at which Senator Jeff Flake (Republicer of Arizona) was in the last minute, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn (Continue) Catherine Jean-Perry said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget about it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protestors sang "The Fall is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to Cavano's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with Steve Rothenberg, a foreign political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it is now, and it is true.
However, motivation can be strengthened, especially in women voters 18-29 years of age, with precedence that have not yet been defined and often do not vote if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford gave a witness in connection with the charges against the High Court judge for sexual crime, analysts predicted the voter's negative reaction if the Republicans insisted on the statement.
According to NBC News, earlier this week's former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party Michael Steel said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As noted in an interview with the U.S. Director of Priorities (United States Priorities) (groups helping in the pre-election campaign for Democrats) Guy Cecil, "it's not a matter of voting on the committee, final vote, or that Kavano was on the bench of the defendants, but of how they reacted to the situation and how they acted on it."
However, the U.S. views on who the testimony of Ford or Cavano has been divided, and some more support has been given to Ford.
According to a recent survey by YouTube, 41% of respondents believe in or believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35% believe in or believe in Kavano’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents noted that Kavano had given false testimony, or more than anything else, while ford had said the same thing to 30% of the respondents.
According to The Guardian, after Fleke F.B.R.'s insistence, he's been investigating the charges against Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Ford gave a witness under the oath of the Senate Legal Committee on how Kavano attacked her while she was in a state of alcoholism when she was 17.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the position of the Supreme Court judge showed her her genitals at the party during their education at the University of Elsa in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition for Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lei, an inventor of the global Internet network, is launching a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is the development of an open-source solid platform that bears Berners Lee's idea.
With Solid platform users will be able to choose where to store data and who to access that or other information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment."
The Solid technology is used to enable users to create "Personal Online Data Repository" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, current business lists, calendars, audio recordings library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at a time.
The unique feature of this personal data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data".
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to activate resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lei, Bruce, security platforms purchased from IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and the volunteer software community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lei said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to do a full replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes over a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication in Medium Berners-Lei, he wrote that the Inrupt mission is "to ensure commercial energy and the ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet into a Consortium of the World Pavutin at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last month, Berners Lee is an influential figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt Bernards-Li, he remained the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Council, the Fund of The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of network development," Berners-Lei added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the ceremony of a church representative of the Order of "Crist Victoria" in the years of World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of "Crest Victoria" for participation in combat during World War I is honored in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded a prize for his participation in the attack under the Belgian and Leocury on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days ago from the sniper’s bullet and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in Rasden, North Hamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called the "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place just 100 years after his grandfather made the promotion for which he was awarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann transferred his battalion through the St. Caten channel "through a very dense fog and under the intense fire of field rifles and bullets."
Later, he rushed to the edge of the fire, and with "stirred courage" he said straight ahead, before that one went into the field gun and destroyed three weapons of the enemy division.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did what he could never do himself and deserved respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put the poison after the advice under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very proud of taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero demonstrates the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they were shown "Peppu Pig"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to watch the Bellator 206 tournament events, and they refuse you the opportunity to review the main event.
In the posters of the tournament held in San José, 13 battles were reported, including six main program units that broadcast live in the nighttime in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were ready to get together, TV viewers in Britain died of a miracle when Peppa's lead appeared on the screen instead of fighting.
Some observers were not impressed by this, since they did not sleep until morning, waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a child's movie was "some kind of unsuccessful joke."
"According to the government's decision the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to let go of the childish broadcast," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice-president of marketing and communications with the public Bellator, when asked about the television,
"Peppa Pig," yes.
Bellator Scott Kocker, president of the company, promised to work on a schedule of broadcasts for future captures and viewers in Britain.
"I think if we talk about re-translation, we'll be able to set it up," Kouker said.
"It's now Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast was off, we received a lot of the messages that we were responding to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it was found that this was an incompatibility with government decrees.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to reinstate the signal for fans, but we've been slowing down these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic stripper in water, Tom Dale, says that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not all look like him," until he went to high school.
Taking part in the release of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he was openly speaking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also stated that because of parenthood, he became less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The director, who has been conducting this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for several months.
When she came as a couple to Lavern's first program, Dale said she felt worse than others when she was a child, because "the community didn't take it when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "So far, the feeling of inferiority and difference was just what gave me the strength and strength to achieve success."
According to him, he wanted to prove something "valid," not to disappoint anyone who finally learned about his orientation.
The Double Bronze Olympics became a famous fighter for the law of the LBHT community and took advantage of this year's Societal Society Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
A three - time world champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, had become a real surprise for him.
Dale took the Oscar award winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but according to him, the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much of this young age" (in the first Olympics he appeared at the age of 14, and after three years his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his own age who would also survive similar summers and falls.
In June there was a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and since then, according to Dale, his "conception" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what to get the gold," he said.
"You know, there are things much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said that his father could not reconcile himself with the idea of the end and asked himself if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the first row because you won't be there any more," said Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Dale took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I've been dreaming about all my life: sneaking in front of my peers at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better about it," said Dale.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Gordia) in the performance of Hizer Small — that he was resonant with while preparing for the Olympics and still called for ants.
The Desert Island Discs program is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
On Saturday with the winner of the "Cube Ryder" tournament, Michaelson was expelled, who was not in shape.
American Phil Mikelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the "Cube Ryder" tournament, but he has to restore the form so that this event doesn't turn out to be unhappy for him.
Michaelson, who took part in a two-year-old tournament on record 12th, took Captain Jim Furik out of the game at the Forballs and Forsams.
Instead of staying in the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to get over the emotions.
Since Mikelson didn't get the right hits even at the top of his career, a 48-year-old athlete didn't really fit for a difficult field for the Le Golf National golf course, where he usually gets the rap for the wandering hits.
And if that's not the case, on Sunday's ninth match, Michaelson will have to meet the Open Championship champion and Master of the Exactly Strike of Francesco Molinari, who won all his matches this week in a pair of new Tommy Flettwood.
If the Americans, who stand at three points after 12 single games, start well, the Mikelson match can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He finally understood his role today, slammed me in the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He does not doubt his power.
Michaelson, a member of the Hall of Fame, who did so much for the teams last week.
I probably didn't expect him to play in two matches.
I predicted more players, but that's how it worked, and that's why we decided to act like that.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson comes out on Saturday, he's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the biggest number of players in the Cube Ryder tournament.
He'll probably finish his career at the Cube Ryder tournament, which never matched his individual achievement.
According to Mikelson, 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 7 night outcomes, Furik said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's kind of funny, he's kind of funny, he's kind of funny, he's kind of funny, he's kind of funny, he's kind of funny, he's kind of funny, he's kind of funny, he likes to joke about others, he's a guy who's a cool guy with a team," said Furick.
"I think the younger players were having a good time riding on it and this week, and it was interesting to watch it.
He's more than just a player."
Captain of the European team Thomas Byorn knows that the big drain doesn't solve anything.
Thomas Byrne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the delicate retreat before the singles of the last day of the Cup of Ryder's tournament does not guarantee victory.
In 1997 the Dutchman won the game at the Walderram Club, where the team headed by His Ballesteros ahead of the Americans at five points, but won the match with a slight break with the result of 141:131.2.
"You remember that we had a great match in the Walderram field; a great match in Brooklyn, where we lost; and the Walderram field, where we won violence," said Bjorn after reviewing the winning Class 2018 games with a result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the match is 10.6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been decided.
We have to play with maximum performance tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will be finished only after the result has been displayed on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who's against us -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players in the complex field, Bjorn added, "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow everything can go differently.
Tomorrow we are expected to be individual contestants, and that's something else.
It's great playing field with your partner when everything goes well, but it's just when you're standing there alone, and you can see what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure players to talk tomorrow: at the edge of the possibilities.
You leave your partner without support, and now he must also show what he is capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furik expects his partners to play a better game on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spyette and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
The last day for Furika was returned to different sides: he was among the winners in Brussels, but he suffered defeat when a team from Europe created "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every curse word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the game.
"We've got 12 major players tomorrow, but we need to start successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves on to the other side, players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We've put the players in the team, as if we're going to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas is supposed to try to lead a counterattack against Rory Macylroy, and then in the first half of the European team, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flettwood and Ian Poulter.
"Only these partners and so on have I chosen because I want to share effort evenly throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his selection of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship has been postponed again
Germany's most modern military-martial fleet was due to be put into action in 2014 instead of the old Cold War War War courts. However, local media reports indicate that this will not happen at least until next year because of incorrect systems and a sharp increase in costs.
According to Die Zeit, received from the military intelligence dictionary, the launch of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the main ship of the modern-day band of Baden-Wurttemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were detrimental to the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wurttemberg class ships, which military and maritime intelligence ordered in 2007, have to replace the old Bremen class frigates.
Understandably, they will be equipped with a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, including radiolocation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the long period of technical security. New frescoes are expected to be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit warns that due to constant delays, over - the - clock military ships that were to strengthen Germany’s military power at sea will also become obsolete at the time of entry into service.
The F125 multi-stricken frigate came under the headlines of the thorium when the German naval forces officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Verf in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media mentioned significant "programm and equipment defects" which made the battleship unfit for military operations.
The failure of the software is particularly important because the Baden-Wurttemberg ship is made up of about 120 sailors -- only half of the army that served on the old Bremen.
In addition, it has been found that the ship has a significant excess weight that makes its operating characteristics worse and restricts the possibilities for further modernization.
It's considered that the Rhineland-Pfalz freighter is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to wrong equipment, another problem has become the overall cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros were turned into an enormous 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
The problems of obtaining new frescoes were of particular importance in the light of recent warnings of Germany's defeat of the military and maritime forces.
At the beginning of the year, the Bundestag of Armed Forces Hans-Peter Bartels reported that the WMS had "a handful of ships capable of carrying out combat tasks".
The officer claimed that the situation had deteriorated for some time, since the old vessels had been out of operation and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed his deep regret at the fact that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg Frigates could fill the military-sea fleet.
National Trust Watches for the Secret Life of Bats
The aim of the new research carried out in the landscaping area of the Scottish Mountains is to establish how bats use landscapes in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take action to protect them in the future.
In the gardens of Inverva in Western Rossi, scientists of Scotland's National Trust will observe species such as netopary carlic and netopary pygmies, as well as hearing a normal and watery nightlife.
Special registries will be located in strategic locations in the lands of agriculture to observe the behavior of bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and availability of bats ’ screams.
Then it's planned to develop a detailed map of animal life and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their environment.
Slave Dwarf, an adviser to nature protection in the National Trust of Scotland, is expected to help determine which habitats are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental care measures (e.g., the formation of a line) and to identify best forest conservation methods for bats and other associated species.
During the last century, the population of bats decreased significantly in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and construction of areas that deprive them of their nesting sites.
Among other negative factors are wind installations and lighting, clay paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks on household cells.
It's not actually blind.
However, nighttime hunting makes their ears more effective than their eyes.
They use a complex method of echolocation to detect insects and obstacles to flight routes.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which is overseen by over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special significance and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, the problem of bats is very serious.
Ten specially trained experts regularly carry out research, screening of nestling sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only Battalion Reserve in Scotland. It is located in the territory of Trev in the Damfris-and-Gallowe area, where eight of the ten species of bats have been sheltered in Scotland.
David Thompson's local manager says it's a perfect place for them.
"In the area of Triv's beautiful conditions for bats," he says.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, and because of the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for bats before any technical work is carried out, because by unintentionally destroying one nest place for the young can kill up to 400 females with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The insects and their nests are protected by law. The animal is forbidden to kill, torture, or trouble.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Conservatory, urged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still need a lot to learn about our bats, and we haven't discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronald rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare appeals against German extradition
Kristian Ronald called the charge of raping the "clap" and said that people "try to pay attention to themselves," using his name.
His lawyers are willing to file a call against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspects.
The U.S.A. Catherine Mayorg accused the foreman of collecting Portugal and the Juventus football club in a 2009 rape in a guest room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronald was supposed to pay her $375,000 in silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, 33-year-old Ronald addressed 142 million of his respecters on the Instagram video, calling them "a trap."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," said a five-time gold ball owner on the camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right," added the footballer, smiling.
According to the information agency Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a call against Der Spiegel for the published charges that they called "an unacceptable message of suspicion in the area of private life".
Lawyer Christian Hearts said that a footballer would claim compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the seriousness of a violation that is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years".
It is said that this incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting with Ronald and Mayorga at the nightclub, he returned to the number of the player, where he apparently raped her anonymously, and such testimony was handed down to the district court of Clarke, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described by Ronald, he fell on his knees and said he was a "99 percent good guy," which he said was "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronald confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a post-trial settlement because she was afraid of revenge and warned of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous contract because she continues to suffer because of an incident that she says took place.
At the time of the recorded incident, Ronald was preparing to move to the Royal Madrid FC with Manchester United FC, which this year he became the Italian football grid player, the Yventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "will forever be sorry" for the loss of automobile manufacturers
Great Britain will "harm forever" if it loses the status of the world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, which is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was approved by the statement of representatives of Toyota UK, who reported to BBC journalists that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without an agreement, the company would be forced to suspend its production and work in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer claimed that the consequences of the delay on the cord in the Brexit case could cost no contract jobs.
The Toyota model car plant Auris and Avensis in Bernaton released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain is extraordinarily leaving the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marwin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain will emerge from the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that the factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are that Brexit can cause risks to supply chains without agreement.
Toyota's manufacturing line is operating in the mode of delivery of details and materials according to needs — details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for car manufacturers.
If on March 29, Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be a breach in the supply of details that will lead to delays and lack of material.
As noted in the company, the Toyota stock can contain no more than one day of detail, so the production has to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in terms of the organisation's relationship with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Checkers Plan), "there are special schemes to avoid problems on the ground".
"We need an agreement, we need an optimal agreement that, in my opinion, will enable us not only to achieve success at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during today's program at BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives and other car manufacturers, we need to save highly efficient supply chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would be stopped, but in the long term, it is expected that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, have to cut jobs.
Peter Cualaris, head of the United Professional Association's executive board at the Bernaton plant, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "I can tell from experience that short jobs are not restored."
The government said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan to form our future relations with the EU."
The meetings of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, marked in the White House
As representatives of the White House reported on Sunday, Donald Tramp's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "laying down for another week" as long as discussions continue to lead to Brett Kavano's candidacy on the position of Judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the election, the links between Tramp and Russia's assistants, and the potential obstruction of the presidential judiciary.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of a deputy attorney - general who would endanger Muller’s independence is discussed.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was speaking for the use of microphones to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the President's mandate as amended by Amendment 25.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the ground reports that the officer was going to retire.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
tramp said he wouldn't want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence after the Senate Legal Committee meeting to give a witness to Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavano, which further suspended the Senate vote.
Tramp's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took a show on Fox News Sunday.
She said to the question about meeting with Rosenstein, "The date of the meeting is not scheduled, and maybe it's going to take place this week, and I expect it to be postponed for a week, given all the events associated with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep on looking for the latest information in the press."
Some reporters objected to this: Sanders did not hold a briefing for the media in the White House on September 10.
Leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the frequent briefings are not related to the unadulterated play on the part of television reporters, although she added, "I won't be able to deny what they're playing on the audience."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The president answers questions more often than any president to him," she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics are talking about themselves."
Sanders noted that the briefings would always be held, but "if the press is able to ask the president's questions, it's better than talking to me."
We're often trying to communicate with the press, and this should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
The tramp regularly responds to questions when taking action outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why it is so, in the presence of journalists, it is shocking and sometimes surprising.
Secretary of State for the Protection of Scotland's Health addressed workers from the EU in connection with concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express their gratitude for their work and to ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already assumed its obligation to cover the cost of applying for permanent immigration status for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said: "In the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on the issue of exit took place, and this autumn we have to wait for the appropriate decisions.
But the British government is strengthening the preparation for a possible outcome without agreement.
I know that this period may be very worrying for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
The colleagues from all over the European Union and countries outside the European Union share valuable experience and skills by strengthening and improving the health care service for the benefit of the patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home. We want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie underwent a terminal surgery after head trauma
The deputy defender of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christio Ebercromby, had a term of surgery after receiving head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with a 31:27 account.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was traumatized shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he got sick," said Reed.
On the side line, the trainers and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it on the wear for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team reported to Chris Harris from the WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie operated at the University of Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's no evidence of the type and severity of the trauma." The Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player got the trauma.
Ebercrombie, a second-class student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after moving from Illinois.
He did five ball seizures on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he had 18 seizures during the season.
Foreign buyers will pay more government fees if they acquire real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more for the acquisition of real estate in Britain.
This approach neutralises all Corbin's attempts to join young voters
A higher government fee will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance expects to add an additional 120 million pounds of sterling per year to help homeless people
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners who buy real estate in Britain will pay more money, and additional expenses will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be appreciated as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to unite young voters with promises to provide more accessible housing for highly paid workers.
The increase in customs applies to individuals and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain.
An additional fee, accompanied by an increase of two - year - old age for the second dwelling and property assigned for rent, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to add an additional 120 million pounds of sterling per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who only dream about their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, are abandoned because a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
The new plan of action only came about a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the government's tax to make life more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate by collecting land without any further use of it.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the area of real estate, including rent control and the impossibility of eviction without sound grounds.
He also proposes extending the authority of local councils in the construction of a new residence.
Theresa May said, "That was the year I promised that I would dedicate my prime minister to renewing the British dream -- for every new generation of life, it must be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair to say that individuals who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become inaccessible, and the problem of living under the open sky still remains very painful."
Jack Ross: "I want to become the chief coach of the Scottish Assembly."
The Chief Coach of the Sanderland FC, Jack Ross, says he's "more than anything" ever wanted to lead a collective of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish took the lead in restoring the club from the north east of the country, which now holds third place in the First Football League, at three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season to the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second assembly in Scotland, but it's over," Ross told the program Sportsound in the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched Scotland's gathering game at the Hampden Park stadium.
The only hope for me is to be successful at the head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at the Sanderland FC, including Dick Lawyer, David Moses, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former Chief Coach of the Alloa Athletics said he didn't feel excited about the transition to the big club should follow such authoritative names by previously rejecting the proposals from the Barnsley and Ipswich Town FC.
"At this stage, I'm going to think that I've achieved success if the club goes back to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and its technical security, this club is no doubt in line with the level of the Premier League," he noted.
"It's gonna be an easy task, but another result I can't think of as a success."
Ross is building a training career for only three years, and he worked as a second coach at the Dambarton FC, and spent 15 months at the Garts FC training station.
Then he helped Alloa find out after the FC got into the third division, and next season with Saint-Mirren went the way from the flight stage to the title of the first division winners.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his career in the Clyde, Gartlepool, Folkerk, Saint-Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"I've been on the run," he says, talking about going to the Alloa FC.
"I sincerely believed that training activity was more suitable for me than a game.
This sounds strange because I was successful, making good on it, and reaching certain heights.
But it's very hard to play.
There are many challenges that have to be met each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a major coach, I feel at home.
I've always been interested in training, and I've never felt so comfortable with my adult life that I've chosen this profession."
You'll be able to listen to the whole interview during the broadcast of Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, at the radio station Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 in British summer time.
Research: 17:30 Sunday is the perfect time for a beer bowl
The summer heat has helped to increase the emergency of British popes who are not experiencing the best times, but has increased the pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the estimates, the sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of Peter Martin of the CGA's business development consultation said, "Thanks to the solar weather and more lasting than expected, England's participation in the World's Championship, July passed the same pattern as the previous month, when the breakfast of the pubs grew by 2.8%, and from there things went even worse.
In July, the fall in June increased by 1.8%.
Dads and bars that are focused on the supply of drinks while having the best indicators are increasing their profits at the expense of restaurants.
Fathers who were fed also suffered from fever, but not as severe as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are interested only in drinking.
In sub-control pubs and bars, drinks increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the Department of Free and Good Business at the RSM, noted: "Some of the trends we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sporting events remain the main factors that affect domestic sales.
It is no wonder that groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits. The annual drop in sales by 4.8% is causing special concern about the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer wasn't the best time for food-supply bets.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new foundations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the market for new brands.
The gallus indicator of Coffer Peach Tracker's sales volume in the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a representation of the collected and analysed productivity indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds 9 billion pounds of sterling.
Every fifth child has a social account hidden from his parents
According to the results of the study, every five children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have a social network account hidden from their parents and teachers.
Studies involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
Twenty percent of students reported having a "basic account" showing their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an account in social networks that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students reported having a clean "basic" account that shows their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
The mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret page saw the call "violently rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social networking profiles, and half of these children have recognized that an additional account is a secret.
The head of the HMC Mike Bukenen Association said, "We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers have a desire to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "a representative of the interests of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of members of the government.
Doyle, Scotland’s most well - known athlete, has been described as an excellent opportunity for those taking the lead in sports to take advantage of the international experience that has been gained over the past decade.
"Eileen uses great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by joining her in the council, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Betty.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired by the role of an athlete's representative, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sport in Scotland."
An American four - time Olympic champion who won a 200 - and - 400 - foot - long [400 m] race in 1996 in the Atlantic, and now a BBC sportsman, lost his chance to go through a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had an stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it would only take time to show me how much I could recover.
As a result of my incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely, and I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for the words of support!"
Women's milk-smokers were compared to cows -- internet-users' ideas were divided
The manufacturer of milk-smokers met with a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising in which young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the first silent nativity milker in the world," Elvie's technology manufacturer has released a humorous music video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that a new smoker provides to mothers.
The four true mothers dance in the full blue bean under a song containing the words, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail" and "As you see myself, it's not a vein, it's my chest."
And it goes on to say, "Smooth, unsmooth to feed the children, unsmooth, unsmooth."
However, the advertising role, published on Facebook’s page, has led to a noisy discussion online.
The video has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of Internet users has proved to be very different, and many have noted that the advertising has underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in industry.
"It's not very clever to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are being taken away from them a few days after birth," said one user.
Elvie's milker can easily be hidden in an Elvie/Mother butt.
Here's another comment: "It's understood that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you put them in for the milk-smoker commercials for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone else said, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users took part in the protection of the advertising role. One of the women's videos turned out to be "very fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would definitely have bought such a thing if I were still breast - feeding.
I felt like a cow when I was sucking milk.
The advertisement was crazy, but I didn’t look for hidden content.
A great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A common advertisement, directed at mothers who suck off milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women demonstrate the milk-smokers hidden in their buttocks.
The concept of advertising is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s smoker works absolutely quietly, has no wires or tubes, and is easily hidden in the butthole for food, which allows women to move freely, keep children and even walk out the street.
Anna Balarin, partner and creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented: "Elvie's vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that he demanded a clear and provocative presentation.
Having made a parallel between women who suck up milk and real cows, we wanted to pay attention to the characteristics of breast-feeding, in a fascinating and interesting way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new smoker will bring.
Elvie's not the first time a smoker gets in the headlines.
As part of the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage with this product when she showed the clothes from the model of Marty Jacobovski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent town on the Thastic border
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and politics on the part of the Tramp administration have made it difficult to place children in care centers.
Traditionally, in most cases, caregivers have given their own immigrants no documents, and now they are afraid of endangering their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to hand out fingerprints and that these data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the high - ranking immigration and customs officer of the Bureau, testified before the Congress that the officers of the Bureau arrested dozens of people who applied for care for minors without accompanying them.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of those who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally -- many of them -- foreigners who have committed crimes.
That's why we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the shelter workers, to take a quick look at the children's affairs, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear before the court during the month after the delay, not after 60 days, as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing and not come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive a shelter will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, as long as children remain under guard, they are more likely to experience anxiety or depression, which can cause violence or escape attempts.
Drivers claim that these problems are reinforced in higher - size institutions, such as the Thornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological condition of children.
They added that by moving children to the tent city and not giving enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends, we risk strengthening the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S. "occupational forces, France and Turkey to immediately take out the army.
In addition, speaking before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Valid al-Mualam, called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country had been in war for eight years.
Mualam, who also works as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil in the cause of the fight against terrorism, so "their attitude would be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and not make any demands," he said at the assembly.
Mualam insisted that "war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has placed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish and Syrian Arabs, who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war - torn country, France sent more than 1,000 troops.
With regard to refugees, Mualem made sure that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unwarranted fears," which prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called for international co-operation and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We are watching the attempt to politicalize the so-called humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild the country until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war has been made.
UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone around Idliba, the last major area of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Treaty has prevented the massive rise of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "clear terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including those associated with Al-Qaeda-Front An-Nurser, who would "be destroyed."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistur expects to convene the first meeting of a new committee to be formed by government and opposition representatives to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualam put forward conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "review of the articles of the actual constitution", and warned against interference.
Why the Trampa Is Re-constructed
According to this logic, Trump can be transformed in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not exercise authority until after the scandal and the implicacy.
No doubt it would be "the most dramatic completion of the presidency all the time!"
At present, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the premium time has doubled by more than 1.05 million on the CNN channel and actually tripled by 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nilsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the rating with 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the headlines were discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Ber, a leading drama producer "Last Candidate" on the ABC channel about a state secretary who becomes president after a destructive attack on Capitol.
Nell Skowell, an experienced writer-thumourist and author of the book "Just funny moments: as well as a few severe truths about entering the Hollywood Men's Club," suggests another theory.
She recalled her trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
Woody told her we'd vote for Tramp.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he'll make me laugh," he said.
Chaos's having fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Row versus Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
A caution is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch a six-hour group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward's "well-known" sources for his book Strah, Paul Manafort's jacket from a $15,000 straus skin -- as described in The Washington Post -- and the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be before.
"The reality of the show is partly related to the fact that you get something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment company and the author of the Lombard Star television program, about the rotations in the actor's warehouse and the daily summary of the Tramp show.
If you allow yourself to miss one episode, you can give up hopelessly.
When this week I was able to meet Mr. Fles in his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, there was a warm sunlight (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home looking at MSNBC and writing CNN.
He could not break free from television — not when Brett Cavano was placed before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but when the future of the Supreme Court hung on his hair.
"I remember how we created all those crazy shows of our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fles told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it seems they were right."

The External Impact of Costs in the Hardest Intermediate Elections in Congress
It's no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there is an additional monetary impact, because by viewing the electoral districts, two actual congressmen compete for one chair.
A member of the House of Representatives of Connor Lemb, who won a victory in another district in the further elections last spring, will enter the fight for this primitive region of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed.
Lemb is opposed to another actual congressman, the Republican of Kitt Rotfs, who is now an old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely in line with the new 17th.
The map was recast after the January Supreme Court of Pennsylvania approved the decision that the old boundaries of the area were focused on the benefit of the Republicans against the Constitution.
The pre-elections in the new 17th district provoked fierce opposition between the financial sub-divisions of the main parties, the Committee of the United States Democratic Party of Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very popular in Pennsylvania after winning the 18th district with a minimal advantage during the additional elections at Congress in March, which were used by the general public.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this district.
Political experts have given little advantage to the democracies.
In the U.S., El Salvador's punishment for China's support was considered, but they changed their minds
The diplomats recalled Washington’s weak opposition to the Dominican Republic and Panama that had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela. Tramp also had a hotel in Panama until the partners were removed from the staff hired by the Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," said the Secretary of State Geser Noyert at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were only dealt with in El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which provided for a reduction in financial aid and a target restriction on issuing a visa, would be painful for this Central American country with its high level of unemployment and homicide.
As a result of the internal council, officials from the North and Central American states held a high-level conference dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and the same was the case last year, and it was assessed as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-level officials of the administration had made it clear what they wanted the conference to be done, and actually the question of sanctions against El Salvador had stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to attend a conference to be held in mid-October, as the administration considers this move to be very important.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic quietly, for there was no new harsh news or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on terms of anonymity.
Their information was confirmed by a foreign analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke under terms of anonymity.
Learn History
The following discomfort may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on the possibility of obstructing justice on the part of Tramp, the weightier evidence of why public information can now be found.
It is reported that Muller is investigating the possible link between the tramp campaign and the attack on our voting system on Russia's side.
If the influence of the Congress goes beyond that, Trampu will have to report to the congressmen, as well as to the voters and, finally, to the partners.
In this case, there's a lot of "if" and I don't want to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, just like his colleague in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and to support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have experienced failure and have lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The movement of history is defined by such breaking moments, and the constant movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these breaking moments.
What will we do if Trump is released from prison by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr. Muller's fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble as soon as the news appeared in this paper that he was secretly proposing to write talks with the president and share his views on the issue of failure to comply with the Trump position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times incorrect.
"How do we react if the investigation against Brett Cavano, who has recently started the FBI, turns out to be not very careful or honest, or if Kavano's candidacy in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite convincing allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, are we going to vote in the middle of the day for those members of the Congress who will be able to bring about the responsibility of Trump?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to make it, because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Osven in the same Nazi regime that once occupied my post office.
She survived, immigrated to America, and for 60 years thereafter sent me to light the Saturday candles on a table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, can I not look to the future with optimism?"

Grem Dorrans from Rangers with optimism awaits a meeting with the Vienna Rapid.
FC Rangers takes Rapids on Thursday. After an impressive night in Spain in the game with Villarreal at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians, the Scottish club will have a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the knee, semi-protector Graham Dorrans was able to play for the first time in the season only in a game with the "Villarreal", which ended with account 2:2. However, he believes the FC "Randers" could use this result as a trampline to achieve greater.
"For us this was a good result, because "Villarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out on a game hoping to get a point and got one point.
At the end of the match, we might be able to move forward, but in general, nobody is likely to be considered a fair outcome.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
There will be another major protest in the League of Europe on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy. Our future opponents have shown good results in their last game, but we can count on the support of the sufferers.
Last year, of course, it was difficult, starting with my trauma and ending up in the club itself, but now the situation was getting better.
We have a great mood, and all the guys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of threats to their pension savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few spoke about it to their family members.
Nearly half of those involved in the nationwide research said that they were talking to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with the children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't rush into this topic," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide Department of Life Insurance.
Here's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the care you need if you do not report your wishes to your parents in advance.
Ask your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor when determining the value.
Contact the financial advisor for advice on how to cover the expenses involved.
The sources of long-term care include traditional insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy, or self - insurance on your own (unless you have money).
Be careful about preparing legal documents: This will enable you to avoid legal issues in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative who will monitor your medical care and monitor your wishes if you are unable to do so personally.
We also try to build trust in money.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay your bills if you are incapacitated.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs immediate medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such information in order to be ready.
"It's not just about money, it's important who's a doctor," says Martin,
which medicines can be taken and
Who's watching the dog.
Prepare this plan."
In Ilfracum, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several times from the pneumatic rifle when he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old sufferer was in the Oxford Groov district of Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, liver and arm.
Officers described the shooting that took place at 02:30 in British summer time as "accident."
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds do not pose a threat to his life, but the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of victims may increase.
The way out of the system of means of liaison officers dealing with the provision of humanitarian assistance cannot get any information from Dongal's regency, a region north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of a 7.5-ball earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Let us discuss a few basic facts about the city of Palau and Dongal’s regency on the island of Sulavesi.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Slovenia, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 according to 2017 data.
When an earthquake struck the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 miles (180 km) along the shoreline in the northwest of the island of Sulavesi.
According to 2017 data, approximately 299,200 people live in the administrative region in the lower part of the province.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the province of Central Slovenia, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel production is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Slovenia.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Reduction over the past 100 years, Palau and Dongal have suffered several times from tsunamis.
As a result of the tsunami in Dongal in 1938, more than 200 people died and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996 the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and nine men died.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in northern Sumatra, caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: At the end of March, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 waves devastated southern Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and triggered tsunamis that hit the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, recorded an earthquake of 7.6 b.m.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - inch - high earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 20 feet [10 m] high, resulting in the destruction of tens of thousands and the deaths of some 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake attacked the Regent of the Asheg Province of Podjia, causing destruction and panic, because people had not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the cracks of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Lombok island of Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
The oldest son of Sarah Payline was arrested for domestic violence
Three Pilin, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and the candidate for Vice President Sara Pilin, were arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police of 29-year-old Peelin from Vasilla, Alaska, arrested for suspected domestic violence and accused him of obstructing reports of violence and resisting arrests.
According to a police report, when a well - known woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is under guard in the Matanuska-Sustainable Insulator with the right to pay $500.
He set himself before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent", when he was asked if he would confess his guilt, was reported online.
Pilein is accused of three Class A offenses, which involve a term of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also accused of Class B crimes, which is punishable by a prison day and a fine of $200.
It's not the first time Pilein's criminal charges have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Payline, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, and he was prevented from reporting cases of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol arrest when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sara Palin criticized the group of veterans for justifying her son’s harsh behavior with post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused tsunamis: hundreds of people were killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - inch - high earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of connections and power supply have come out of power, and the number of victims can increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the center of the island of Sulaves, located in the northeastern part of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
The video that spreads on social media shows the moment when nature hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Pala when the tsunamis hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty of Syfulo Saypova, a suspect in a New York attack, resulting in the death of eight persons — a rare penalty that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October 30-year-old Saipov, a driver hired at the Home Depot pickup went out on a bicycle track along the road to the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to beat down the bikers and pedestrians that happened to him on the way.
According to the report of the intention to claim the death of the South District of New York to justify the death penalty, the accused must prove that the Saip "intentionally" killed eight persons and "intentionally" caused serious bodily damage.
According to court documents, each of these charges provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Avoid Court filed a 22-point charge against Saip, including eight charges for murder for the purpose of a claim that federal prosecutors usually raise in cases involving organised crime, as well as charges for violence and the destruction of road transport.
According to the prosecutors who described Saip's crime as "horrible, cruel and cruel," this attack is the result of "real planning and pre-thinking".
The victims of the injuries, injuries, and killings of Sifula Habibullaevich Sayop became Diego Henrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferruci, Ernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report of the purpose.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since New York South was the last time they committed a death penalty crime.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, and eventually sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for the federal case was carried out in New York in 1953, the couple Julius and Etel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair.
According to Saipov’s court case, the native of Uzbekistan did not show a guilty conscience the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was not sorry for the damage.
According to Saipov’s indictment, he informed the authorities that he was inspired by the IDIL video attack he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that he had also asked for an IDIL flag to be hung in his hospital room.
He did not blame himself for the 22 - point charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by such a decision by the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of a confession of guilt and a sentence of eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release will only reinforce the psychological trauma caused by these events for all the victims," Patton said.
Saipov’s defence party also earlier asked the prosecutors not to claim a death penalty.
Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party believes that the NIJEL FARADJA must be appointed responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, while protesting at the party's party, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the National Army."
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "taste pressure" on Europeans, as one of Teresa May's MPs proposed his candidacy for EU negotiations.
A deputy from the Conservative Party Peter Bowen said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "have done" if Mr. Faraj was the secretary of Brexit.
In view of the problems that May faced, trying to reconcile its deep-seated lines, more has turned out to be that the members of the Conservative Party who are fighting the march joined the special action of a protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to implement a compromise plan by Chequers, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not allow an attempt to negotiate with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labourers to choose between what they propose and the chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihali, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "reject the Chequers."
He invited Mr. Farague to come out of the shadows and assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for this, we'd be out," he said.
The MP of the Wellingboro Parliament added, "I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We fought in world wars, not for ordering.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after voting in 2016 the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British changed their mind and did not want to go out does not really fit the reality."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who are actually walking on the streets and fighting for the votes of the voters.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In reference to Teresa May, she added, "The Prime Minister keeps his position when promises are fulfilled."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians should "taste pressure" if they were going to reject the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't come out of their hands."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray Brexit, to feel pressure on itself.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become independent, self-employed, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the opposers went through Birmingham and then held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Several activists were blurting the banners against Brexit's Conservatives after the group started.
Labyrist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because after opening the conference, security problems arose through their party program.
"These people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "consider seriously" about the president's job.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would "be seriously thinking about beating the president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general meetings in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts told of his future.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, is fighting in November against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dill, who was co-head of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as the main candidate that can fight the Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, she had her 36th meeting with voters in the form of general congregations since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government job, and for that to happen, there must be a woman."
The suspect was arrested in the murder of the LSU Tigers.
The Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana State, reported on Saturday that on Friday, they arrested a suspect in the murder of the LSU Tigers.
The Baton-Rose Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the morning.
On Friday, they published a video shoot asking to help identify a person on it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot at a campus at the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"The Wade Sims was hit with a head fire and killed as a result," said reporters on Saturday 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
The investigation found that Simpson was in a crime scene, had a gun with him, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken custody of East-Bonton County police.
Sims, a 6-foot-and-6-inch-all-in-a-year-old boy who got into a junior league, grew up in Baton-Rose, played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season and spent 17.4 minutes on field, picked 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton cut off the stand for the world's championship title after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Fettel.
Since Walter Bottas left behind Luis Hemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’s commandal decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start with the semi-post and almost surrounded Hamilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his friend on the team.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the back of the race, which was supposed to solve everything.
The Mercedes pilot went another round and went out behind Fettel, but Hemilton jumped into the leadership after a certain maneuver wheeled to the wheel, resulting in Ferrari reluctantly leaving the internal space through the risk that he would be pushed, after the double maneuver enabled him to jump forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Later, he led most of the race because he did not change the tires so that he could quickly come to the finish line and bring Kimie Rickkonen from fourth place.
In short, he stopped at a pitch at 44 o'clock, but he couldn't increase the speed of the last eight, so he planted the fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Walter's been fully trained on all the exits and showed generosity when he gave me the opportunity to go.
The team did an exceptional job to take the first and the second place," said Hemilton.
The Body’s Language Was Not Impressed
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Tramp laughed at Senator Diane Fianstein for her firm position that she did not announce the content of the letter by Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses the candidate of the Brett Cavano High Court in sexual violence.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated to the human "fear, coldness and falsehood."
"The only thing that could happen, and everything that's going on in the Senate in the last few days, is anger, you see the bad people who are demonstrating vanity, freezing and lying," he said.
"You look at the publications and the published information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Do You Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you report the information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn’t announce it.”
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Finland sent a letter containing a detailed statement of charges against the Ford against Cavano, and in early September, its content was announced, but Finland denied that the leak of information had taken place in its office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information she received from her," said the Finnish Committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
However, her opposition seemed to be unpopular to the president who was commenting at the Saturday meeting: "I tell you, her body language was not at all impressive.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone holding back."
While continuing to protect the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women were accused of sexual violence, the president assumed that the Democrats were using charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to restore power in any necessary way.
You see humility, hunger, all of them who are offended, who have to go through to gain power and control," the media quoted the president as saying.
"Dandy Stairs" – "Belfast Giants," 5:3
The player "Jeants" Patrick Duyer threw two shots at the match against "Dandy"
"Dandy Stairs" rehabilitated for a Friday defeat in the elite league of Belfast Giants, winning a match-response Saturday with score 5:3.
"Jeants" got an early advantage in two shows because of Patrick Duyer and Francis Boville's kidnappers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney compared the bill in the home match, and then Duyer pulled the Giants out again.
The Dandi player, François Bushar, was equal to the score, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen were to ensure their victory.
This is the third in the season of the elite league defeat of Adam Kif's team, which won a voluntary victory over Dandi at 2:1 a.m. Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season.
The first show was thrown into the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall was handed over, and four minutes later, Boville, who received the show from David Rezerford, doubled the bill.
After the tense first period for the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16) Connie, receiving a show from Matt Markvardt, compared the account.
Dwyer won the title "Jiants" before the first break, throwing his second show at the end of the first period.
The owners of the field were regrouped, and Bushar again, for twenty-eight minutes (27:37), was recalibrating the account, throwing away the crew, when his team was overtaking.
Because of the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he took Dandi out for the first time and ensured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, who's already lost four of the last five, is playing a round game against Milton-Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
Aerial inspectors in Indonesia were declared a hero after helping to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
Over 800 people died and many lost consciousness after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground rushes continue to strike the area, and many people are trapped in the city of Pala.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a disseptic tower, which was going on very well, at the airport of Mutiear SIS Al-Jufrey in Pala.
He remained in place to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then on the airship, was safely taken up.
Then he exploded out of the firing tower when he thought it was going to be ruined.
Later, he died in a hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Srywait said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports Australian Agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikapapan in Kalimantan, which was to be delivered to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
In the meantime, the government is afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, because the disaster relief agency states that access to the cities of Dongal, Sighi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can increase because many bodies are still under fractures, and many of them cannot be reached," said Sotopo Purvo Nugroho's representative.
The six - foot - high [6 m] - height minutes led to the destruction of the city of Paul, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and food.
Rizza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is hurrying to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Ododo, came to Pal on Sunday and said to the country's military officials, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niugini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one man disappeared without a message
The airline that carried out a voyage that had suffered catastrophes in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims that one man has disappeared without a message, although earlier it was reported that all 47 passengers and crew have been successfully evacuated from the plane that was sinking.
In Air Niugini it was said that one passenger could not be found on Saturday.
The airline reports that her representatives are trying to find a man and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Air Force reported that the plane landed in the lagoon near the air traffic jam.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew through the airstrip.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low on the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes explained that he and others were able to get to the emergency exits on a ton of air while on their belts in the water.
He explained that the stewards were panicking and shouting and that he had a slight head injury.
In the U.S.S., mariners near the coast were reported to have also helped in the rescue operation by delivering people to the shore by means of an inflated boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in air accidents associated with PNG aircraft, but Air Niugini is not included in this list.
An analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the defendant violated the case against the man charged with burning women from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Roulett witnessed as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone records to play the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis movement and Jessica Chambers' 19-year-old victim on the night of the murder.
Roulette, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received information about the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night when she died that she was opposed to his previous statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at the Sanford pickup that night, Sanford said he was "false, because my pickup was at Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed that Chambers knew about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette explained that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, Chambers released text messages, calls, and contact information from their phone.
"He stared her out of his life," said Gail.
The defense should set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip-hop?
Three hip-hop performers want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – he has gone away with political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the sources and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
Recently, artists such as The Fugees and Commons have witnessed this rebirth in the United Kingdom through groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark-haired?
In New York, she called for a couple to be released after receiving a "racist" message.
In New York, she called for a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving an incorrect message from her mother complaining that she was "one more darker."
The marriage denies that they are racist, comparing the calls with the "requirement."
Lucy Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that a new girl, Giselle Morris, arrived on her first working day in 2016, was a dark girl.
"No, there's one darkness," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a report.
Instead of sending him to his husband, however, she sent him twice as much as Miss Morris.
As New York Post reports, aware of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Faxman felt "inconvenient" and released Ms. Morris, who said that their previous African-American girl was doing her job badly and that instead she was expecting a Filipino girl.
Miss Morris was paid for one day’s work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is putting a couple in court, hoping to get compensation for her paycheck, which she would get six months of work in a marriage where she was initially hired, even without a contract, and she was supposed to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them what not to do," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she had sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said her husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with the man you dealt with cruelly, even if it wasn't intended?
Your baby?
"On the other hand."
Comparing the call to "requirement", Plasco said his wife gave birth to the child only two months ago and "has not yet recovered."
"Would you revenge someone after that?
It's a bad act," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As reported in the new letter, Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bonda's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was printed, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the person who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success that has been achieved in the story of Paddington."
Speaking of her father, who was a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimizing that his work was rejected, she shared how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt at the same time "joy and sorrow" because her father died a year ago.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was quite modest and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Paddington was as real to him as his own child! For when children reach something, we are proud of them, though it is not theirs, but our victory.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington just like that.
Although Paddington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, two hospitals named Louis Pastera were transferred to Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called regularly, said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"And then Nad called me and said that she would die for the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tash, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating, gradually stopped working, and came out of the body.
She died for a while before everything was off.
I was just supposed to sit there and wait, knowing what was happening at that time.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've held myself up."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was burning up because of the loss of her daughter, was on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold my tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave their letters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphres are staying on the Wall Street bridge with phone numbers that people can turn to for support, as well as messages that they should be inspired.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he put his hands on him.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Sydney, told me that her son was a promising chef with a beautiful smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother’s body after he laid his hands on him.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created the letters so that people knew there were those they could contact and talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't shut up, you need to talk."
Ms. Hamphres, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed that he had depression or something," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he's changed."
And on Christmas day, he finally lost his mind, and when the children opened their presents, he did not look at them at all."
She told me that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it: "It's a ruinous thing.
You have to go to your family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Cavano depends on the hair: the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement -- Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "be excited" in the face of the inevitable loss of loyalty of the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their dissatisfaction is about time.
The middle election will take place in five weeks, 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make it difficult for them to make their own choices before the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators with a request to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush's reign, and who made him meet his wife, Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, a vote will take place.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano could obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of passengers from North Korea has been cut short.
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of passersby from North Korea to South Korea decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Pac Pion Seug, referring to the Ministry of the United Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of passengers was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors were to strengthen border control between North Korea and China, as well as that illegal smugglers are now demanding more money.
In Phenyana, they refrained from public comments.
The majority of North Korea's survivors are finally proposing South Korea's citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans reportedly crossed the border illegally after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyrenees and discussed the issues of denuclearization, about which negotiations have taken place.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yon-Ho accused the United States of failing to make progress since then.
"With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no single disarmament," said Ri Yon-Ho in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano "historic" and says he's not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate of the Judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavano "historic" and said that he did not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I always thought that if a woman ever showed up like that, she would be called "historic," "Pelosy commented on her reaction to the testimony of Cavano before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavano emotionally denied charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavano was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "absolute and coordinated destruction of reputation", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
According to Pelosse, the testimony of Cavano proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
"I think that by these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to declare the Cavano implicence if his wine was confirmed and if the majority of the representatives were given democracy in the House.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only appropriate to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works," Pelosi said.
Now Cavano is serving as judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was disturbed by the possible decisions of Cavano against the law "For Available Medical Services" or the case "Roo v. Wade" because she was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the issue of confirmation of the position of Cavano, he asked whether he was cancelling some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
"Not now when the judge becomes hysterical, prejudiced person and we'll say how great it is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that have been contained in them for months and years of anger, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," she told me 45 years later, Miss Stein.
"I don't think it's something unusual, but you?"
She continued: "One woman who worked as an executive director and helped me very much said that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she was angry and started to cry, she said to her partner, "You can think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I'm evil."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was amazing."
Tears are considered to be an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my earliest memories of my first job in the office, where mostly men worked, was the situation when I once cried out of unexplained anger, and the older woman, the unwelcome manager I was always a bit afraid of, grabbed me behind a cell and dragged me to the upstairs cell.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Garth in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was arrested on board a boat named Monkey Business, after which he left the race, Miss Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she could not fight for the president's office.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a smile 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate was the last one they needed."
Someone called it "Blysneck and Seven Dwarves."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she had left the congregation, and she made a promise that she would not take part in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not harm her in support of her husband’s $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she spoke and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was touched by the emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the frustration of the system, which made it very difficult to get the money and forced her not to look at voters as well as members of the House of Deputies, as well as the anger of sexism, she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the press.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S. - China Trade War Can Bring the Benefits of Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S. - China trade war were desperate, and, although far away from its completion, the long - standing gap between countries can bring the benefit of Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
This week’s biggest increase was due to new tariffs on goods at a total cost of $200 billion (150 billion), which actually pays half of all the goods coming from the United States to China.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, recently imposing a customs fee of between five and ten percent on American goods for $60 billion.
China has committed itself to using similar U.S. measures, and the second largest economy in the world will not be able to keep this promise as soon as possible.
To force Washington to resign means to agree with the requirements, but for President China, China, public worship in the United States is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is properly used in the situation, the pressure in the US trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the linkage between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries, and this is actually a greater threat than observers have recognised before," said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security Analytical Center.
Foreign Minister said Syria was "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, it is reported that refugees are ready to return voluntarily and are called upon to help rebuild a war - torn country that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualam stated that conditions in the country would improve.
"The real situation today has become more stable and secure as a result of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore destroyed areas so that people can return to normal life.
Now all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they had to leave through terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their livelihood.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulam claimed that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in restoring the war that was destroyed in the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the siege.
Europe Strengthens the Victory of the Cube of Ryder in Paris
The European team won the Cup of Ryder in 2018 when it won the U.S. team with a summary of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Kubok Ryder tournament since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team took 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American Phil Mikelson star, who tried most of the tournament, broke his first long shot at the 16th moon pair-3 in the water and went to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever had a 5-0-0 score from the start of a tournament in modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit suffered defeat at 5:4 from a player with the lowest score in the European team Turbian Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first stage in the world rankings, took place at 2:1 Jan. Poulter from England, who probably took part in the last Cup of Ryder tournament.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of Cubca Ryder, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most time in the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to get the doll back.
It's a team's merit, and I'm glad I was able to help," said Garcia, without withholding emotion after the victory in Europe.
He gives the essay to his co-worker, John Rem, who won the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a solo game with a score of 2:1.
"I feel the incredible pride of winning over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four players and now has a career record on Cube Ryder 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 major tournaments, only Jack Niklaus.
The United States gathered throughout the weekend to try to reach the ferry zone, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaou, who showed a high - school golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain of the United States, Jim Furik, said about his team after an unpleasant speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm working with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Cube Ryder tournament committee, and we're moving forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't praise them.
They've lost me."
Current information about the Red Flood: Reduced concentration in the Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Nature shows a general decline in the level of flowering of red microorganisms in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to Florida’s Committee on Fish and Wild Nature, the conditions of high flowering reported in certain areas of the districts of Penellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collaire are evidence of a decline in concentration.
The flowering of the red - colored microorganisms extends about 130 miles [130 km] from the north of Penellas to the southern regions of Lee.
The spots can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Gilsboro, but they are less than last week.
The Red Flood was also observed in the district of Pasco.
Last week the average concentration was reported in the district of Penellas and its coastal zone, low to high in the coastal zone of Hillsboro, high concentration in the district of Manat, high concentration in the county of Sarasota and its coastal zone, medium concentration in the county of Charlotte, high concentration in the county of Lee and its coastal zone, and low concentration in the county of Collaire.
In the districts of Penellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collaire continue to report the breakdown of respiratory organs.
Such messages were not recorded in northwestern Florida last week.
