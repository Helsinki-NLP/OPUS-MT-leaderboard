The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 per cent
The significant weakening of both sides of today's major coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have brought, according to the first preliminary results, a week's early parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered severe losses, where the position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the Allied Election Leader for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Korutan Heitman Jörg Haider, is about to return to national politics.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of the votes against the last 2006 elections but loses 5.5 per cent.
Even worse was the loss of GDP by 25.6 per cent of almost nine per cent.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in the Austrian war history, and especially of the people who called the early elections, literally disastrous results.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP emerged from the coalition, people had a significant leap in their preferences before SPÖ.
However, the voters were clearly punished for letting the government waste.
In the first reaction to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the president of the party and current vice-cantor Wilhelm Molter.
Observers consider that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Presidency of the Party.
Such development would probably facilitate the path to the increasingly likely outcome of the election, i.e. the restoration of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - free (FPÖ) had obtained 18 per cent in advance and 11 per cent in BZÖ - the social democrats at the same time expressed concerns about the resumption of 1999, when people agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 the BZÖ sealed itself) on the common government, which even led to sanctions from the European Union.
This development is clearly in favour of Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to Vienna to state policy.
The Green Party has yet to be brought to Parliament, which has lost slightly and has been lost between Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
None of the other sides clearly exceeded the four-percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Vztahy with India can cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal collection of strawberries in India was not solved, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karl Schwarzenberg said that there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister introduced it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian opponent Pranáb Mukherdzi.
"If it didn't work out, yes, then some cooling would happen," he noted after a meeting that took place from the Czech initiative.
Mukherdža said after the hearing that in judicial matters, enforcement can be difficult to deal with.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Peter Schwach, who was acquitted and punished with torture, the central government may deal with the local government in Darjaling, where the matter falls under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kucher, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherdzi, to appeal to the higher court.
Then he can apply for bail and wait for a sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that he also expressed himself to his partner during the conversation.
"He recommends appeals to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole matter is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the ČTK said, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really regard it as a profound mistake to arrest and denounce these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question whether he got a commitment from the Indian side to take care of things, the minister avoided.
"I've already got quite enough promises," he said.
Czech judges the battle of the seabed
It comes to a walled electronic map that shows Australia and adjacent maritime areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it an adjacent seabed.
The area is however large as a continent alone," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a 30-year team of UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Law.
His boss, division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is watching and sometimes fills in.
It's the work force and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far hidden a little known world rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, ore and other non-growth raw materials, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a drug against cancer.
Bottom greater than the bottom
The coastal states today have begun to make huge changes in the sub-areas.
According to the UN Convention, they enjoy their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
It has an exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of continental shelf.
"Simply taken, this part of the seabed as a continental ruler is subject to which is the natural continuation of the continent below the sea.
It is located outside the coast of the sea, often within two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the definition of the outer limits of the continental shelf shall be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on a number of cost studies and measurements.
It's the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three countries have so far succeeded," Mikulka adds.
World advertising has recently seen Australia’s success, which has largely expanded its sub-sea states.
But even New Zealand - the length of the seabed, which the Commission gave him last week, is about 1.6 million square miles [1.6 million sq km], about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that will result from using the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be invaluable.
They shall submit their requests gradually to other States.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, by a convention declared "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state here anymore having an exclusive position.
The right of establishment in this area shall be conferred on an international institution established by convention.
"The bottom of the sea but there is no Clondajk," says Director Mikulka in his statement that his "single areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually sealed".
Czechs in the Pacific
The part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic today.
They are shared with other states of an Eastern bloc within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, it was awarded under the Convention, as well as the investors of few other states, the status of the so-called "pro-ceeding investor".
He is entitled to live in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area studied by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
Down there is a member, it's some kind of underwater replica of Tater.
"It can be weighed on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich place for polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan, says.
The Macedonian employee of Rober Sandev brings one such particular to the show.
It reminds of a little potato or, in a bit of fantasy, a wonderful show that, according to legend, brought Golem back to life.
German special intervention units were released
The Egyptian government has requested that the experts come to the aid of the German authorities in dealing with the crisis.
When the situation came to an end, special units were ready, however, but they did not arrive.
Further details of the situation of freedom of movement for European tourists are gradually being obtained to the public in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence data, German special forces were directly involved in rescue actions.
According to the Ministrys, there were freedom on site, as well as members of the anti-terrorist group of the German GSG9 police force police, the Federal Criminal Office and also experts in logistics from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk).
However, according to another statement by both ministries Monday afternoon spokespersons, German forces did not need to leave because the kidnappings left their prisoners and fled when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for local action.
"There was no luck," said one of the spokespersons of the public ministry inside.
The attackers took out a group of passengers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian guides to Egypt on 19 September.
After being kidnapped in the wilderness in the south of Egypt, handicrafts moved into border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappings has remained unclear for the last time, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, rescues are in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is under the care of the German Embassy.
He didn't speak to the details of the release.
There is no information available in Berlin so far when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild", all five tourists should also fly with special forces from one of the German airbuses and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. Snowman representatives rejected the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress had a narrow majority of the savings package for the financial markets worth $700 billion.
The Dow Jones index went down a lot.
From 206 to 227 votes, the American Snow Representative rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of US President George W. Bush and both sides' front policies, there was no majority of them for the programme, which should alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
With the dramatic action, the supporters desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote by the MP to express his consent, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The investors' concerns were that the state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that after the notice of scrapping the package could fall again sharply.
Experts are now counting on other major turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, there is a need for the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agents record increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in travel:
According to one study, there was a marked increase in the booking of trains for the next month compared with the previous year - in the winter season even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans remain willing to travel unaccompanied.
During the winter season, travel agencies recorded an increase of 31% against the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) introduced in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Survey Institute, there are already increased number of reservations for the autumn months.
Thus, according to the RDV statement in October compared to 2007, about eleven percent higher.
The basis for these results is GfK numbers, which evaluates the reservation data from 1200 German travel offices each month and interpolates them on the total market.
To this end, bookings were included by the end of August 2008.
Because of the low dollar rate, most of them are requested to travel to the United States, the DRV said.
These trips increase bookings by about one third.
In addition, in the Germans, Spain, Turkey and Greece and also domestic waters are particularly targeted.
In particular, organized exercises are in course, DrV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of the increasing expenditure on energy and food, the costs are here "for a customer dreamable than for an individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that the money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for a temporary reservation or offer all-inclusive.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year, a higher turn will be recorded again - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has declined compared to the previous year.
My first October party
The finished repeated pepper, beer from the tulips and prominent ones in the bowls of famous designers.
For the first time in a beer bowl.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV moderator, and she's wearing a tight roof.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes on the brewer's lap, and we're already being hit by photographers and bbits full of memory cards - that's a shame for me, but I'm at the October festival first.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap roof has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north from the Blobás equator, and so my sense of comfort in the field was rather limited.
But right after coming to Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone has a female coat or leather pants; no one looks down on or down - everything is completely normal.
The special views of the banana stand in the chocolate are all my imagination.
One Mnichovanka reminds me that I wrongly bound her: "You're free on the left, in the middle of the bride, on the right, on the back of the widow."
They're hiding behind the back of the counter.
"All right," he says and laughs.
The others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much, and they have simple folded hats on them with the inscription "That drink to get dressed!" and they run around our ass.
A young man with such displayistic tendencies is named Bob, who came from England and came to the October party for the first time.
He looks like a gorgeous guy with a long look.
That'll tell me after you've had a drink.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everybody thinks are garbage.
Bob is, therefore, one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as the public in Bavaria is said to be freely wet people.
The rest of the lucky ones don't get rid of alcohol like this.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, they run around the area where the October party is held, often the health professionals who have to take care of the dead drinks.
Health professionals always show up in henches - in four wear a covered coat from state to state.
They work like most visitors to the beer cellar: empty there, full back.
Whoever's lying under the cloak of this pity is nowhere to be seen.
"That's the only one who can't go on anymore," calls me in answer to my question one of the doctors and goes away.
Police published the name of the victim of an accident
The name of a thirty-year-old woman who died in a hospital after she was hit by a car in Essex was published.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood struck Carole Paulson on Friday afternoon from the darkest Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but she died later.
After the accident, one-and-a-half-year-old man was detained for suspecting an innocent ride.
He's already been released for police bail.
Turkish diplomatic views are expanding
Long before Turkey began its attempt to join the European Union, European powers have long longed to penetrate the Turkish border.
On the eastern coast of Bospor, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the best memories of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaš railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-renaissance style.
That's what tourist guides tell you.
The building sits side by side at the end of the procession with towers on each corner across, with a view to not recognizing from some provincial German councillor.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But as soon as a person gets inside a precious treasure, he can no longer doubt the size of the company, the most westerly gate of the station.
In August 1908, the station opened a German consortium of Anatolian-Bagdadian corporations.
The Germans, who were involved in the games of the empire late, intended to carry out their ambitions of the Middle East through this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further to the territory that is today Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions grew during World War I.
Their colleagues were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial units have been operating from Egypt and have forced Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news also came to Hydarpaš station.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its designed roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
From that time on, they've been playing around and history has been around.
Today, however, this gate to Anatolia continues to serve - at least symbolically - to highlight the growing views of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling party Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
The new policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on a night train in the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet with one of the leading AKP experts on foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after the cobbler's ride after the trains, which reminded of the ancient rhythms of the famous Night Mail document, I arrived at the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm of Turkish consensus.
In the West, she raised suspicions, especially in Washington.
Taxi brought me to the main state of AKP, ultra-modern stone and metal buildings, deliberately built on the developing suburbs, surrounded half by scattered commercial houses and shops, where middle managers in commercial clothing - men and women - meet to make quick morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could peacefully be a mid-term policy from almost any other European political party.
Sako, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
The cold war was anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But I'm sure it's time," I asked myself, "when might Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want such a decision to come."
Then he stressed what almost everyone I spoke to said almost remembered: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board it seems that Europe, as a whole, can, metaphorically speaking, travel on these wheels east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpaš station, after most of the night up, I thought of those two German men Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who were watching this building built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, essentially, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting at the port for the ferry back through the Bospor, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt that the continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
Rememberful lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As the guildford music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, 11 September) was the head of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the congregation.
As part of the periodic music plan, he founded a year on the excellent collection of young Proteus.
He was about 21 years old, but when Proteus sang last in 1979, there were almost 30 of us — we simply refused to give up.
The name "Proteus" (mythological form changer) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to join any music that was presented to him - whether they were madrigals or Messiah, either alone or with the whole orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young congregation was often overwhelming, always exciting and all because of the inspiration of this one man and the enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanging all the time.
How often did Todd just tell us to "let the music speak for ourselves"?
He said, "The author knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
So sing it!"
His tactical technique was completely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Florentine.
No matter where the music standard was, he's always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If some conductor was supposed to be matched to a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed over 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed - and I have been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply "drawed one or two scattered pecks around the world."
A lot of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrolologist William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD".
This comes from Woodruff's author's notes at Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he studied economic history at the University of Nottingham and then obtained a dissertation work on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He actually spent 1950-51 years in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and in 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff crossed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resin's "Flamenco and Life" exhibition because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They put me in line with the simplicity and the strong drive that the spectators are using, and the consideration and respect for the photographers.
A exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino can catch magical moments."
Honda's second attack with his bestseller
In November, Honda starts selling the second generation of Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had a large space, it now offers even more spacious interior.
To this end, improved engines are added, which increase the comfort of the ride and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution is more than revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes in this one-space vehicle.
We need to mention, for example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we look at the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the first generation was introduced.
So the first thing we're going to notice is that Honda needed a shorter period than other manufacturers to defuse this model.
Although Jazz is a less known model in Europe, it became a phenomenon in other markets.
This may be the case in Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since Hondy Jazz was placed on the market.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, sets out to increase sales in his category.
Thus, while this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 pieces of Hondy Jazz in 2007, the 2009 estimate was 100 000 cars, which would increase by 17 % on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model, meaning 6.7% of the total sales of Hondy in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the Spanish leadership is expected to sell 2,000 pieces a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honduras to significantly reduce the drop in sales in Spain.
Car management thus de facto expects an annual wedding with a total of 22,000 pieces sold, which means 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
In spite of this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % last year.
Then in 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of his new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-dimensional hybrid compact size of 4,37 meters long, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 pieces a year.
In the case of markets, according to the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
The start of Hondy Insight's sale is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
On the contrary, the first generation of the new Jazz has increased all sizes.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), a width of 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and a repair development of 2.5 meters, which means a length of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, hasn't changed. It's still 1.52 meters.
Increased dimensions have also resulted in an increase in interior space.
However, these advantages have been achieved through the use of a new platform, but through the storage of fuel tank in the middle of the vehicle already used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also, the volume of luggage space - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 litres, by 19 litres more than the volume of luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the engine version 1.4, because the volume of luggage space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement besides external elements - such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipped with a clear panoramic roof - is easier access to rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow the angle of opening 80 degrees versus 67 at the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of Hondy Jazz, there are new engines.
At first this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements to the fuel system at the same time as a high-speed torque in full engine range.
The first engine with a volume of 1,2 litres has 90 horses at 6 000 wheels with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 wheels.
This engine - which was used by the previous generation of Jazz 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and emissions 125 grams of CO2.
Unlike the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horse performance has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Auto Bitch" prohibits collisions
In order to develop technologies to protect against accidents Nissan was this time inspired by nature, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company created a robot that takes it for a model of flying bees, and thus prohibits collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in the prevention technology of collisions.
The engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robot developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Tokyo University of Japan.
According to Kazuhira Doie, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, BR23C is presented as an extension of the four security shield zones of Nissan.
The robot has the task of strengthening the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of this brand.
During the summer, each female creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very much like the safety shield of Nissan.
However, the most important are the complex bees of the eyes that are able to see in all directions in an angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the bees to fly in their personal space without stopping.
The engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder to create this visual function.
It records the obstacles that are located up to two metres in the 180-degree radius before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which will immediately transmit it to the collision warning.
"At the moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot will resemble the bees of the movement and immediately change the direction of the wheels to the right or even larger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference against any existing system is that all maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of Mobile Laboratory and Chief Engineer of this project.
The robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to a direction that is enabled by the rotation of its wheels, but not in infinite quantities of directions and possibilities as with the bee.
Nissan therefore also used rotational functions to prevent the robot from crashing.
"The device only needs to process information every few seconds and be kept in accordance with these data.
It does not require the storage of information or logical intuitions from previous maneuvers, which can work without interruption with only two tons of memory.
It may surprise you, but we're not talking about giga or mega at memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies, the immediate prevention of collisions, the technology in which Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and will last longer than lithium ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the building of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead drivers to the goal and avoid obstacles to the road.
Enjoy your fear before taking your mortgage
It should be acknowledged that the US Ministry of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to inject, is not lacking in inventiveness.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at a bank with doubts of solvency, it created a popular-scientific Bad Credit Hotel online game.
It doesn't hurt "The Hotel of Bad Credits"... or the whole hotel.
The hotel and especially its receptions look cloudy to let a person once, twice and three times wonder if it's the right time to ask for credit.
And then especially where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even if you are not too detailed.
It's a site more suitable for young people than space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
A room of dreams will appear inside the hotel.
At least something because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital MUFG
The Banking House Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank that spends nine billion dollars to earn 21% of its capital.
One week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was willing to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a single cost of $25.25, representing a total amount of $3 billion.
The current price is 19 % lower than the accounting value of the securities by 31 August.
The MUFG is investing another six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities, which will provide 10% of its profit and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the entire operation would be carried out on the basis of an average single price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % under its current price.
Morgan Stanley's stock, however, lost 6.79% and got around $23.07 in Greenwich time.
"This strategic combination is an important opportunity on the way to speed up the transition of Morgan Stanley to the banking holding statute," explained John Mack, Director-General of this American group.
The new statute was adopted last week by Morgan Stanley, which is intended to enable him to distinguish his activities, but at the same time it is under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His contact with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis has forced the largest essay from Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, among other things, show that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it sells up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for around $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," explained Toshihide Misuno, executive director of MUFG, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary actions.
However, given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risk to the minimum and also to cover."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley’s securities by 7 % less than their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit from the share of around 20 %.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if they are last appointed for a certain time at a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange price, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital that will bring MUG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the spokespersons refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be proud of the payment capacity ratio of Tier One around 15%, which is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan made it clear that since the end of August, he had reduced his balance.
The last few weeks were difficult for the group as its stock exchange rate dropped by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payments linked to the debt grew rapidly.
These costs took place on Monday, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week Goldman Sachs announced, the only other "survivor" from the big investment banks of Wall Street after the Battle of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merril Lynch, that she chose $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
To re-establish the Republic around socialism in the 21st century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominated speaker put the proposal of the new Constitution to the vote, following the pattern of his opponents and friends.
And his mission was fulfilled because 64 % of the voters, according to the official results covering 80 % of the votes, voted in the "yes" referendum.
"No" according to these results was 28 %, 7 % were invalid and 0,7 % were void.
In order to accept the proposal of the Constitution, he had to obtain half the votes plus one.
Two polls carried out on the East of the Electoral Chambers and the non-governmental organisation's budget predicted a clear "yes" victory Sunday, with a population of 63% to 70%.
The rest of the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his proposal of the Constitution.
"The Constitution has won the whole row," assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil government headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quit.
It is understandable to themselves that Rafael Correa received a blessing from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean opponent, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the United States Organization (OAS) observation mission, took place in peace, referred to the text on 444 points that would be "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution sanctifies the state's power over the economy by replacing it with the "planning of development" of a country that lives mainly from oil to foreign companies and from the currency sent by its immigrants.
The proposal protected by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of the state, which will be able to perform two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the camera.
Correa has already announced that this power will be exercised and that a new mandate will be held in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution reinforces the principle of free health and education, which the President has begun to introduce in the country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also includes a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point for American drug operations.
In Chad, 19 hostages were released
The Egyptian team attacked eleven tourists and their eight-member escorts, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held for ten days in the desert, were transported alive and healthy to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning they released the Egyptian team in Chad.
Handicrafts flew around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base, close to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transferred without being able to speak in the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi hospital, the district of Káhira, to be covered by medical visits.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the orphans," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zohejr Garran on the road.
Since its capture on September 19 during the safari in a vehicle driven all four rounds at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another 35 unknown kidnappings.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border manager of the agency Aegyptous, safari organizers.
A certain representative of the Egyptian safety components indicated that 30 members of the special units who approached the site on board two helicopters had arrived on board during the night just before dawn.
"There was a gunshot, half the kidnappings were killed and the others fled," said this source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "light" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian teams.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini, from Belgrade where he is located, mentioned the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professional and effective people from our secret services, from the special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also argued that it would be paid off.
On the night before, the Sudanese army declared that it had kept a vehicle running all four wheels on board, with six of them killed, including the Chadian commander, and two of them were arrested.
The army claimed that they were linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unit (SLA-U), which immediately refused.
Letters - Quiet majority of the cultural resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the page with new headlines and is the theme of the pre-election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still being overlooked.
Who will rise to pry the poor sums provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memorial sites that are starving?
What policy does the federal government have to remind itself that they are warning their memories and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Chinese castle in the Valley of Loire?
Our American neighbours are told in the Constitution that the protection of the cultural heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all regional organisations, in co-operation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Québec History Companies, it seeks at least 40,000 volunteers associated with 211 companies for history, memory, archives and genealogies on the discovery of history, the preservation of a collection of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few small.
Often these companies are the watchdogs of our memory, who are driven hopelessly protesting when promoters and leading agents release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten graves.
When do we finally meet the history and memory courts?
The governments of Benelux fortis
The Benelux States will assist the Belgian-Holland Bank fortis, which, as the first in Europe, has been in difficulty due to the widespread effects of the US mortgage market crisis, with a partial settlement: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institutions, which also have a capital share of EUR 11.2 billion in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to participate in the European Central Bank President and the European Commissioner for Economic Competition.
Banka Fortis is the first in the euro area, which, in the context of the crisis in international financial markets, has spread over the waves for more than a year, has got into a major crisis, and the decisions made in this area could, in some respects, be considered as precedents.
In the sense of the decision that was made on Sunday night, all three states will purchase almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's property.
The bank will certainly sell part of its equity shares, especially – mainly insurance – activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis's shares began to fall quickly last week, and in the second half of the week, there were serious signs of the crisis in the constitution.
However, analysts agree that with their 85 thousand employees, the bank is too large to let it down.
The company's securities fell only by 12 per cent on Friday, at a minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the overall market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, however, it is unrealistic according to the company’s leading representatives.
The management of the company is also responsible for the fall of Fortis's foreign market uncertainty related to the adoption of the US package plan worth $700 billion.
On Monday, the stock just stepped up.
On Friday, the new Director General Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has signed up.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors must not be afraid to pay their money.
The bank's clients haven't panicked, and the sidewalks haven't been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also assembled several leasing companies.
Pulp in chicken
Life and health insurance in America based on people’s data on the purchase of medicines often excludes the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with the customer.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that applies to the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
This must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we trust the chicken of the fox," says Washington Post Richard Dicka, author of the program for monitoring prescriptions.
The insurance undertaking shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the event of insurance events dependent on the health of the persons concerned and, where the risk is assessed as being too large, shall not close the insurance with it.
They had previously sent the relevant medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on an identification number, a customer from a doctor will easily find out what medicines he bought himself for the last year and half, from which the program itself derives what he suffers from, what he suffers from, and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large amount of medicines to reduce cholesterol, this refers to having virtually uncontrollable high blood fat levels, which will immediately be listed in the higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program currently in circulation, some of them also determine the risk coefficient, so there is almost no work to be done in insurance other than papering, even though there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages are that milder medicines can also be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraine or fever but are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant risk-insurance factor from the point of view of commercial insurance, which is not a first-named problem.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been established which require the patient to be authorised before obtaining the necessary information from the doctor.
They are already forced by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their present carelessness.
Some companies have been working on the results of laboratory tests that are linked to the data on medicines used, thus providing an even more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
It has more and more access to data, and at the same time it will be increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a special health data protection law, but its effectiveness applies only to healthcare providers and insurance providers.
The proposal for a law which gives authorities the power to control and companies specialising in the provision of data is before Congress.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: therefore he developed his program in such a way that it is linked to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permit in question can only complain of rejection, otherwise the insurers will not conclude the contract with him.
So, the blind are only slightly exposed to the leaf of good will.
Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India double the turnover
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this theme has led to other, mainly global, issues also in the order of the ninth summit.
Today will also be held at the French-Indian Summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is developing a democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator on the issue of supporting the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as current President of the Union, respectively President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed that trade would double up to five years or increase to more than EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessive ambitious target.
In this respect, it was legally agreed with twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation, so it has been brought to future and air transport by green.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the proceedings.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Dilli is among the EU's partners until its ninth place.
The Summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, terrorism - both sides in all its forms have condemned and called for an accelerated convening of the UN conference.
They also ordered the end of the round of business negotiations from Dauha, although they both have a great share in his current ill health.
The European Union has confirmed that it will last on its energy and climate programme, because it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
It also agreed with India, as well as with the fact that the next year's climate conference would require a 50% reduction in global agreement and the production of greenhouse gases by 2050.
Both parties would also like to prevent food price increases and support the convening of an international conference for the resolution of the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister travels to the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, he is about to conclude a trade concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that the commitment to build Indian nuclear reactors worth €20 billion is made by French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
A large participation of Italian publishers at the international library fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers participate in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Library Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to take 171,790 meters of square fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the Italian Inaugural Celebration in Pavilion: Italy is actually participating institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italy) – on 264 metres of square exhibition grounds.
It will follow the meeting with the press in Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books in relation to the overall Italian production is still diminishing, mainly due to literature for children and adults.
Found a plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire missing on 3rd of September 2007, was found while flying over the desert in Nevada.
The troikas were discovered on one upper level at sea level three thousand metres, in the area of Mammoth Lakes in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remains inside the plane.
Sheriff Madeira County, John Anderson, raised the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent the team there and now we are sure that it was exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared" he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63 millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the identification of the cuts, an investigation team was sent, which finally identified the aircraft: it is exactly about Bellanca 8kcab, not reported since 3 September 2007, when Fossett flew from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some Fosset's personal objects were found near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, money in cash and one bundle.
The search for Fossette was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
A billionaire gained a place in history through a long collection of championships.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete his journey around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flying alone.
Three years later, the world flew into a plane without landing.
Among its many records are also flights up to 15,445 meters, above the Andes, even with the bastard.
Glk, ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and precisely defined definite lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the "compact" jeeps home of the star, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring news into this sector.
Its non-traditional processing will result in an unexpected and unconventional and communication that will accompany the introduction of Suv Glk on the market and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the start of the new vehicle, also launches an informal way of communication thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which was first used in Italy for the car brand.
The Maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the major Milan shopping class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin by portraying the car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see a new Suv in almost real size and in three dimensions.
Actually, if you look at the picture, you'll have the impression that the car will leave the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its little ones, so that it can then be recombined in one image.
Mercedes is no doubt trying to introduce this advertisement into the stereotyped area of car communication.
Will he be able to awaken the interest of future customers in this way?
So we know who the Italian hulligans are.
From Trivenet, they're risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the Ultras Italia group, which has been following the National Azzurra for years and which has never, in fact, done any excessive problems.
She's never even met the opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-coloured flags showing the cities of origin of the participants: they were removed on Saturday night so that they were not identified.
They're inspired by English fans.
They found real Nazi fans in Bulgaria, Levski.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all by name, so easily controlled.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslem, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier stadium offenses were denied entry and the fight was banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read news from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the emergency.
The International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chulligans, in short, don't even go to one stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is fear of emulation: it means that more than one hundred fifty are added to them.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave this way," Viminal confirms.
So, "very open eyes, mainly because of a national match in the middle of Leča".
Right in Puglia is the little core of support.
Tomorrow will be the Observatory, on Tuesday Casms, which can also count with one part of Aise, is a secret service that takes care of the problems at the stadium.
"The Congregation Leader-Leader and the strained pajamas during Mamelia's gym?
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really poorly happy way), who is the director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (he has won a place that was once Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Quaestor in Terst, where there is the core of the Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002.
It's true, Mazzilli says it's not a crime in Bulgaria to celebrate the leader, but, of course, the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
"I am not a sociologist - the Observer unit - the crimes are attributed to the country in which they came.
So far, this group has remained within range, now let's take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about a star at Mameli's hysteria: it's not a crime, but if you allow it, it's an uneducated...
