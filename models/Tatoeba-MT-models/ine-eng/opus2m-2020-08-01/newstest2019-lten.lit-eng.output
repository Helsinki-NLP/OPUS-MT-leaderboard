MG Baltic case: the new Gustavian lawyer says he has not yet been able to contact the file
At the 11th session of the MG Baltic trial on Monday, all the accused gathered: Charūnas Gustanis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšis, Eligius Masiulis and Raymondas Kurlianskis.
The trial started with evidence from the accused.
At the previous court meeting, the state appointed new lawyer, Mr. Gustany, told the College of Judges that he had not yet been able to get acquainted with the case.
At that time, MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevičius said that, in order to ensure full personal protection, the judicial board must allow the new lawyer to get acquainted with the substance of the case and requested that the hearing be postponed.
"In order to ensure the protection of a person, he must familiarise himself with the substance of the criminal case.
It's not just a formal sitting," said L. Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, pointed out that he was unable to get acquainted with either the defendant's act or the whole case.
S. Gustanis, the suspect at the previous court hearing, reported his lawyer's resignation because he could no longer pay him.
The meeting also heard audio recordings.
The defendants’ lawyers resent that the audio records submitted to the court are of poor quality.
Legal protection is suspected that, by taking stock of MG Baltic, politicians have supported or initiated group-friendly decisions in the Seimas and other state institutions, and have also had an impact on the decision-making of public procurement winners, the ELTA recalls.
More than 150 persons, more than 50 of whom are members of the Seimas and this term of office, have been interviewed during the judicial investigation, several former ministers, Members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews were conducted and more than 30 Krauts were conducted.
S. Gustanis is suspected to have received more than 8 thousand euros of cash, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšis - more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected to have taken more than 106 thousand euros of cash.
The working party is suspected of acidification and trade, the Liberal phenomenon of acidification, trade and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of papering and trading of these parties.
It is suspected that the political group spoke to MG Baltic, Vice-President Kurlianski, and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives for the group either in Seimas or in other institutions.
Ethics Officers: Board of Liberals on Vilnius Chamber of Conduct
"The decisions taken by the Government are in accordance with the laws," the BNS, after a meeting of the Commission, informed its leader, Vytautas Tamosiūn.
"Our decision was not something new.
An explanation as a commission had already been made in July, when the question of Grace and Uten was raised.
We then said that under the laws this is a matter of the competence of the board.
And if the board decides that any section can act as it wishes - to go with the committee and the board agrees, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has done, then it is the decision that all sections should form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to stop membership and to go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamoshiūno, the party board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Liberal Consensus Board of the Party annulled the decision of the city section of Vilnius to participate in the municipal elections, not with the party, but with a new electoral committee.
In the opinion of the Party Board, the decision of the capital Liberals to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the laws of the Party, the decisions of the Board.
By 31 October Vilnius had to withdraw its efforts to participate in the municipal elections with the Committee's list.
But the department didn't.
The former head of the section, the parliamentary Foreign Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal consciousness.
Vilnius Mayor, former President of the Liberal Consensus Remigius Shimasius, who promised to achieve another term of office as President of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the Public Elections Committee on Vilnius, which is proud.
He also left the party.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year.
On Monday, the locals in northern India seized the border with the tractor, which had previously torn one man, the officials reported.
The forest management officer Mahhavira Kaujlagi (Mahavira Kaujlagis) said that the tiger was late on Sunday after working in the fields, the villagers surrounded the animal and, in an attempt to break it, she was caught by a tractor.
The residents say that about 10 days ago this tiger also attacked and robbed one young man.
The village is located in the district of Lakhympur Kherio, about 250 km south-east of Utar Starteš state capital Laknau.
It shall be prohibited to use tigers in protected areas.
Dr. Rameshas Pandey (Ramesas Pandey) said that under the Rural Nature Protection Act the case would be notified to the police.
In April, the village of Utar, the state of Homeland, destroyed another tiger in the Nighasan region, which suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Wild Nature Protection Act, tigers are considered to be perishable species.
Last year’s government figures show that at least one person was killed every day during the previous three years in the clashes with wild tigers or frogs.
People's conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 8th century, when India launched a tiger protection programme that established trade unions and saw the end of large cats as a crime.
Although the methods of calculating tigers changed, the census would show that the population of approximately 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 in 2014.
Proposed cats and dogs necessarily marked with microspecies
The Chairman of the Seimas Committee on the Environment, Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other Seimas members, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Law proposing that cats and dogs should be labelled with subspecies.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with sub-species and that their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In the year 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge, and in 2020, cats will also have no concern and will be covered by the specific public funding," said the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, Kęstutis Mažeika.
The legislative amendments aim at addressing the systemic need for the labelling of pets.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price of the micro-scheme and service to be around 5 euros, all owners of animals will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total price of all pets may be up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be allocated over three years and will reach EUR 2 million annually.
It is expected that the funding will be allocated to labelling programmes through the Municipal Environmental Support Programme, which will significantly increase revenue this year due to the redistribution of natural resources taxes and funds.
These funds will be used not only for the labelling of cats and dogs but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to K. Small, mandatory labelling practice in almost all countries of the European Union, this allows for the protection of the animals themselves (but can easily be returned to the owners) and saves the time of the breeders themselves when they have to spend a lot of time and money on their escape and lost breeding.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked farmers can travel.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible care for the animal’s entire life.
The previous proposals for compulsory labelling were subject to opposition because the programmes in question were proposed to finance the population.
"The current model of these criticisms should be avoided, because animal protection is proposed to finance increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to mark not only veterinary physicians but also publicists, i.e. persons who have heard special courses at the Academy of Veterinary Sciences," says the authors of the project.
The bill was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different groups of Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenius Gentvilas, Edmunds Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Yesterday's hand helped Ukraine's club
On Wednesday, the matches of the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will take place in Vilnius's Ryto Arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
Dvikova will be prepared in the capital for political reasons.
With warm relations with Ukraine's basket, Vilnius's Rytas will take over the team of Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina's "KB Pristina" on November 7th after its roof in Ryto's arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to organize this match at home, so we are very pleased that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us, - the Ukrainian team coach Maksima Michelson thanked us for the East.
- We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree very well.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so we will be truly honored to play here.
Let's hope we'll get some support from the whales.
The Kosovo team was unable to arrive in Ukraine because these countries had no diplomatic relations.
The Ukrainian team is now taking the third place after the first round with one win over three meetings and the Kosovo team is in the second position and has more.
This will be a very important focus of Group E, as only two teams will reach the next stage.

Then 100:61 was the victory of the Ukrainian team.
On Wednesday, the basketball players will be able to access the games free of charge, and the start of the two - hour course is 19 hours.
"Women lie better" star actor B. Arsobait persecutes liars
It's probably just coincidence, but the amazing redhead actor Brigita Arsobaitė has played a role in lies once and for all.
At first, the series "Women Lies Better", then the show "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagīi".
In this film Brigita plays a prominent wife of Songine Kazlaus' hero.
"I really liked filming in Melagia," because I'm more of a theater actor and I look rare in movies.
A great team of colleagues has been gathered from the very beginning the excellent result of the promise.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the square was Sunny's dog!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never dreamed of those little, decorative "fif" squares.
However, through the filming Sunny so joined me, the sympathy became mutual and finally I had to buy it from the owner, but failed," said the actor.
In the comical and intriguing peripecies of family members, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagai", produced by Lithuanian film hits "Unexperienced" and "Among our boys..." by Paul Virbick and producer Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Racionovas, has been involved.
Your lover just reported it. She's waiting.
It would be a great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't publish all the "good news", your parents suddenly say - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening even before the most beautiful of the year's holidays - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, for such atoms were not believed.
All the heroes are not what they looked like from the first look...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė comedy "Melagai" a good atmosphere for spectators four times a movie star: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Ujaitė, Giedrė Giedratiytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Gardvainis.
Comedy "Melagai" - in China since 9 November.
Ready to write off EUR 100 million unpaid taxes on immigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Living Place prepared by the leader of the "States".
56 Seimas voted against - 9, and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will then consider the amendments on or after 6 December following the conclusion of the Government.
According to Karbauski, these contributions are counted for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the Parliament, within three years one person does not pay about EUR 1 thousand, and now there are about 100 thousand of such persons.
Social Democrat Algird Sys regretted that in this way Seimas would "invite people not to keep their obligations" to declare their departure and then no fees would be charged.
Antan Matula, a member of the Committee on Health, observed that Lithuanians living abroad are using the fact that when paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania to treat - they are given the same services as those who are paying this fee to the residents.
The amendments provide for persons who leave Lithuania to pay social security contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" to be exempt from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The leader of Sodros Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of those who have emigrated, and the activities of Sodros.
The video on the Internet that spreads about a listening bear reveals a serious problem
Swallowed like a mother’s lap, she slips with a flat, snowy lashe, and the baby is still glued down and then re-copyed.
Many reviews and comments were received from the video.
People were walking around the back of a small bow - not once they slipped down, he was climbing back to his mother.
It does not happen for the first time, but the child does not try to give up and eventually reaches his goal.
The video is truly focused, but it also exposes the threat to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know the wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
"It seems to me that the bow of the drone was very disappointed.
Their movements show they're panicking.
If the drone did not break the environment, they would probably have chosen a safer path or overcome it more slowly or more carefully.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," said Ecologist Mark Ditmer to The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues were investigating how drones operate.
In animals, heart rate was adjusted.
When the drone came, one leg let go of it, the other let go of it, but all their hearts began to cry out more often.
Scientists advise drones to film animals for responsible use, avoid overcrowding, avoid noise and avoid falling where it is prohibited.
The president of the run-off was contacted by the newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev court invited President Viktor Janukovykis, who had withdrawn to Russia, to come to the trial on his alleged state treason meeting in an unusual manner - the summons was published in the State's official journal.
In the appeal of the court, published in the Government Knowledge Journal "Uriadov Kurjer", the former leader is invited to attend a criminal trial session on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Janukovyčius has the right to participate in the sitting in video communication.
On 30 October, the Court of Justice published a final debate in the Janukovyci case.
Mr Janukovyči, a lawyer working in Russia, was given the opportunity to register before 19 November in the register of foreign lawyers so that he could attend a meeting where Mr Janukovyči, as expected, would be a video link to his last word.
The Kremlin-based V. Janukovyčius was transferred and fled to Russia during the Mayan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that a former Ukrainian leader had been transferred to Russia during a special operation organised by Moscow.
In that year, Russia annexed the Crimea Peninsula that belonged to Ukraine, and as soon as the country's war ended in the east, there was a war between Kyiv and Russia-supported separatists.
Since then, some 10,000 lives have been spent in battle, despite many attempts by the international community to ensure long-term relief.
The list of conservators to the Vilnius City Council will be Valdas Benkunskas
Former Minister of Agriculture Dainius Kreivys has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
During the first elections of the Conservatives, the party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
As reported by the party, V. Benkunskas was the chairman of the meeting of the TS-LKD Vilnius Section on the list of conservators.
In the first ten candidates attended the Vilnius City Council members Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adamas Buzinskas, Gediminas Svilpa, Audrius Skaiskys, Rasa Baskienė, former member of the Seimas Lituras Kazlavickas, President of the Youth Conservatories League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karaziaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on co-generational forces of the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, to the Constitutional Court (KT) has challenged the decision of the rulers to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Seimas Father's Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that the group of Seimas members had referred to the KT by asking them to examine the compatibility of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the governors to the Constitution.
"Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the projects of waste incineration plants already under way, instructing the Government to establish new restrictions (20 km from the dwelling area) until the entry into force of the law in Vilnius and Kaunas to build waste incineration plants", - the report writes.
"Parliaments note that in view of the way in which the law formulated a ban on the construction of objects of public importance for waste management (i.e. a distance is established and the definition of the concept of "resident territory"), it is concluded that this ban is disproportionately limited or even denied the right to carry out economic activities related to the production of waste incineration energy, the substance being that the established criteria are to be formulated in such a way that, by assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be virtually impossible to construct such objects throughout the country" - added.
We would like to say that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"KT has repeatedly pointed out that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences that have arisen before the entry into force of the new legislation adopted.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law back on the basis of an indefinite criterion.
After establishing such a legal regulation, the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, legal expectations protection are violated, so the constitutional principle of the rule of law is indicated."
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration units.
The state would not only experience hundreds of millions of financial losses, major losses and the Lithuanians would increase the heating prices due to increasing environmental pollution in waste disposal.
Members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Group, the Socialist Group and the Senior Working Group of the Socialists of the Governing Social Democrats signed the referral to the KT.
A few weeks ago, Seimas was able to vote 71 to reject amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalias Grybauskaitė veto, which provided for the government's right to suspend the construction of cogenerational power plants already started, as well as 20 km from the residential area of quarantine.
The amendments to the law of the Seimas re-adopted by the Seimas will enter into force as from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the Government's right to suspend projects already under way is not planned.
KT will record the order of the case - not earlier than a year later.
Published by LeBron James statistics at Lakers Club
The start of LeBron James' career at the Los Angeles Lakers Club is not as expected by him, the organization and the basketball fans.
The Lakers season started with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped to emerge with delights due to the possible release of Coach Luke Walton.
However, such languages calmed the President of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who said he would not forgive the coach, but he needed to play better.
The greatest star in the team, L. James, should come back to himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 points recovered and 7.7 results transferred.
But she's not telling the truth.
During the first ten seasons, other numbers appeared showing that Lakers was playing better when there's no L. James on the field.
A +/- statistics for the attacker showing how much more points are invested or missing a team when there are certain players in the field.
That's when L. James is on the field, Lakers passed 30 points this season more than the competitors.
He won 19 points more than the competitors while sitting on the ground.
At the Western Conference, Lakers is just 13th place, but several victories can turn everything upside down.

The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," said Minister L. Linkevicius.

V. Acaine on the detention of R. Acha: I believe in male insecurity and the rule of law
"I thought it was the most incredible thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the ministry is likely to carry out the work that must be done.
We're all working our jobs.
I believe in law enforcement, I trust my husband that everything is right and fair, that no dishonest action should be taken by him" - BNS said V. Acienė.
R. Ača Special Investigations Service (STT) held Monday - law enforcement suspects that he was still a director of the administration of the municipality of Razenia took a high-value basket and could exchange exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with a city-run bus park of Razenia.
Private business representatives are suspected of directly paper by R. Ač or participant in masking mixed financial transactions.
R. Ača, the council of the municipality of the Rasei region, resigned from office of the Head of Administration on the third April of this year following the expressed lack of confidence.
The former "ordinator" this year became a new member of the Socialist Party of Lithuania's newly established Gedimino Churchill, and he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
R. A few years ago, he failed in the mayor's election as a representative of your Raseini election committee.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy in the Raceian mayor's elections the following year, but had not yet decided whether or not to participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Aciene to the Seima was elected with a list of Lithuanian states and the Green Union, which is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
Politicians say that they are waiting for further law enforcement action - and will depend on whether it will be removed from the work commission.
"I really didn't make decisions today, this week, I think, I will decide.
I can see, if there is a need to make the accusations, I will, of course, take some or some sort of decision.
I must probably stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - all the time is set for my own place," she said.
The representative of the opposition Conservatives in Seim Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnenė invited the President of Seimas Viktoras Pruckietė and the leader of the "States" Ramūnas Karbauski to withdraw from the statements of the Group of Environmental Affairs and withdraw it from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring it to another Seimas committee or commission.
It states that further work by Mr Ačienė on the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to public-based mistrust and discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission".

The war "stopped the way for this attack because it identified a terrorist who tried to strike a bullet for civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) soldier", says an Israeli army-wide report on the incident near Kiryat Arbo's settlement near Hebron.

Grebauskait calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment by the European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate foreign import conditions.
Grybauskaitė stressed that the common objective of China's economic slowdown in China's import exhibition should be "to unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world" by applying to the underlying causes of the tensions caused by the war of trade, "production surplus and unfair competition".
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible by ensuring that foreign business is expected and safe here, as well as by strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said Grybauskaitė.
It believes that China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The head of Lithuania stressed that investment transparency must be "higher than any business group's interests".
"Intensification, law enforcement, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be an essential issue for the environment of new investment relations," said Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China's import show is trying to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its businesses.
The exhibition is attended by several Heads of State, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently taking the 25th place among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China rose by 50%, reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to more than EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania can have an adverse political impact, while Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe is disrupting the EU's unity.
Disadvantages to resolve: mobile signature service is already in operation

The mobile signature was reopened at 2.28 p.m.
The mobile signature system crashed on Monday at 9.52 a.m.
These failures were experienced by customers of telecommunications companies Bitės, Tele2 and Telia.
The cause of the "SK ID Solutions" disorder has been identified but does not reveal it for safety reasons.
The company apologizes to consumers for the inconveniences experienced.
"SK ID Solutions" specializes in international e-identification solutions.
These are Estonia’s partners, issuing national identity certificates and allowing citizens from different countries to join e-services and to submit electronic signatures.

Discovered the reason for the plane’s disaster: the close attack of the deceased
On Monday, the researchers reported that in at least four of the last four flights, Lion Air’s airline’s cargo black box showed that there was a speed meter malfunction.
The Chairman of the National Committee for Transport Security (NTSC) told Soerjanto Tajiono that a similar approach had occurred during the last four flights of the aircraft, including the fateful one, when the other dropped into the Java Sea on 29 October immediately after being taken up from Jakarta.
During this disaster, all 189 people were killed on the plane.
Many media reported irregularities during the previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasaro to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually the air speed, in other words the plane speed," said S. Tjajon during the press conference.
"The black box data showed that over two flights before the journey Denpasar-Jakarta was the same problem," he added.
"Societal networks spread many branches.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (data from the report) there were four flights that had problems with speed measurement," said the head of the NTSK.
During the meeting with the members of the deceased families, Mr Tjajon said that the information of the aircraft recording the flight data was consistent with the reports that the aircraft had increased its last flight speed and altitude irregularly.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the pilot cabin.
Lion Air indicated that, following a technical failure from Bali to Jakarta, it was corrected in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak with Minister of Communications Budi Karya Sumadi, a moderate meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for and investigation of remains of aircraft and victims.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when the angry and grieving family members demanded that R. Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan, present the Lion Air in 1999.
"Lion Air did not behave properly," said one man who was introduced as a passenger by Shandy Johan Ramadan, a working prosecutor on the island where the plane is flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never been in contact with me since the beginning of the crisis.
We lost our baby, but Lion Air didn't show us any feelings.
After this meeting, R. Kirana hurried out to avoid journalistic questions.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long-term recognition process.
Police medical experts have been transferred to almost 140 parts of the support of people loaded.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The natives asked why two months ago the second one was allowed to fly, although a failure occurred during the flight from Bali to Jakarta on October 28, among other things after the passengers were caught by the sudden crash of the plane down immediately after the lift.
"Lion Air" said this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the relevant techniques must be taken into account.
The Law was very clear and did not say that the aircraft was allowed to rise again.
These poor techniques must be answered in accordance with the law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr Tajion said that a large number of small breaks and the fact that the breaks spread in a rather small area indicate that the other was probably heading into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was unique when it fell into the sea.
He didn't blow up in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when he slammed the water, acted in large turns - this shows all the broken turbine minds," explains the officer.
Lion Air is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997 when the plane Garuda was hit by 234 people near Medano.
After the crash, rescuers were guided: injured and unaccompanied
On Monday evening, on the road, the Cancers - Plunge, in fact Tilviki had cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz".
The cars were hit by a car, reported to three people who were injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, went out to the opposite side of the road and the coach drove to Mercedes-Benz, who was born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued by firemen - rescuers.
The girls from Mercedes-Benz were killed in an accident.
All the victims are taken to the hospital.
Presidency: there is no need for artificial relief from the referendum
Following the approval of the Seimas Governors' proposal to reduce the referendum card to the first section of the Constitution that currently has greater protection, the President amends the vote, says her adviser, Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This change, especially in its first section , should certainly be by no means a minor majority .
It is not hard to predict that the President would really veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė, the adviser to internal policy, told the Knowledge Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic subjects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, so that by reducing the number of votes required to change these articles, according to Mr Linges, there would be "a negative precedent" and "an unresolved risk".
"In the President's view, there is no need for artificial relief, the more it needs to prepare for the referendum itself, the more it needs dialogue with people," he believed.
The Seimas is scheduled to vote on Tuesday for the adoption of the amendment of the referendum law.
It provides for the adoption of amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution on higher protection, provided that at least two fifths of the citizens entitled to vote are approved by the referendum.
Currently, the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution may be replaced by more than half of all citizens with voting rights.
There are about 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania: half were 1.25 million voters, two fifths were million voters.
This proposal was born after Seimas approved the President's veto in September on the amendments previously adopted in Parliament, which eased the requirements for the number of votes in the form of an amendment to Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
It is proposed that the referendum card be reduced by a referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May of the following year and on 26 May of the year when the presidential elections are scheduled for the first and second rounds.
Emigrants cannot enjoy dual citizenship at present on 11 March 1990, except for some exceptions.
The dual citizenship of the world's Lithuanian community, however, is afraid that a referendum will not take place under the current circumstances - that there will not be enough people to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airport "desk", therefore they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are starting to fail, so it is necessary to update it, says Minister of Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimal task that the State must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already fragile because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - this is not even in the remote planning, it is the minimum that we must do", said Mr Masiulis on Tuesday at the communication conference held in the State Development Fund and the newspaper.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important because important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the external airport of Klaipėda, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and perhaps the construction of new airports.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of the external airport in Klaipeda, the management of airports, perhaps the construction of a new airport.
We must not fall asleep, now start projects that will take advantage of our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Communications.
Mr Masiulis repeated that too little money is being spent on car road maintenance in recent years.
"The state of the roads is still not improving, because the funds are not being allocated enough.
We can build new roads, but even the most necessary supervision, for example on highways, is lacking.
We must set the amount that should be spent on road maintenance if we want their situation to improve," said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that the exports of Lithuanian transport services increased 18.6% this year and the largest export market became Germany, covering Russia.
Mr Masiulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers should return to the country of registration on a regular basis.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for train drivers to return to their homes is absurd because empty trucks, fuel-fired, would increase emissions in Europe.
Most of this is because the cost will rise so much that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," said Mr Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12.2% is created in the transport sector.
Lithuanian Common Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and employs more than 7,500 companies.
A dispute with the heirs
Last week, Mr Masiulis Seimas, in the Economic Committee, announced the beginning of negotiations on the change in the cultural purpose of Vilnius Airport, which would allow the old terminal to be destroyed and the construction of a new one.
However, the interim leader of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis called Masoulio's discussions a political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the sixties last year is a value, entered in the register in 1993, not for politics, but for experts to decide on its removal.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"From the legacy to extract that old terminal would be a political step that could be cut down and build a new modern terminal of arrival, to feel in the ruins of Vilnius in a modern country, rather than in such an interesting, truly unrepresentative country as innovative," said Mr Masiulis last week.
Mr Masiulis also reported that Kaunas is planning to build a completely new passenger terminal and a airport to connect to Rail Baltica by building a underground station.
This transport unit should operate in 2026, after finishing the "Rail Baltica".
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected that 4.8 million passengers and 5 million next year.
Last year, Kaunas airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.

Next year, direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, the largest scheduled flight will take off at Vilnius Airport, Boeing 767, which will fly directly from Lithuania to the Be Island of Madagascar on the basis of information from the travel organizer Itaka Lithuania, writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose from 259 economic class and 8 business class seats.
The new destination will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, Director-General of Itaka Lietuva, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the East African coast.
Other tour organizers also prepared new travel destinations for the summer season 2019.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start directly from Vilnius to fly to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance for the Possible Crisis: It is important not to talk about disease
"We always have to prepare for a tougher time.
What I want to rejoice is that the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we are collecting reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about disease," said Mr Šapoka on Monday when he was in Brussels.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Miguel Tuskienė attends meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoiding fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how revenue from certain digital services should be taxed in the EU Member States until it is agreed at global level.
The Euro Group will review the draft budgets submitted to the European Commission (EC) in the euro area countries.
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as non-compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC takes advantage of this option.
For more information, please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss economic and monetary union-enhancing issues: the possibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the ESM functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Buracz.
Traditions and customs of Lithuanian work
Recently 120 years have passed since the birth of a prominent Lithuanian photographer and cultural journalist, ethnographer and co-student Bali Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiaulėn County, then in Šiaulių Government.
Recalling the 100th anniversary of the state of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how life-encompassing national rebirth has called on many of the people of Lithuania, including their brothers Buračus - Balus, John, Bronius - to engage in the entire creative capacity of the depth of the village to embrace, embrace and preserve our cultural traditions.
Balys Buracz, who traveled for more than 50 years after his home country with a camera in his hands, presented a broad and real picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly lost pillars of national culture and had little ability to understand the continuing value of his work.
In the pictures of Balio Burač, Lithuania's landscape, piliakalins, everyday and festive environments have decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines to impress our people with national costumes.
This publication presents a number of examples of the legacy of Bali Burač for the description of national customs and related traditions and, above all, their attractive icons.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite the two world wars and heavy occupations.
The book contains a great deal of written descriptions of the work of the Zemaiti, especially of the cemeteries, of the cemeteries, of the nebulae, of the nebulae, of the nebulae, as well as of the work of the inhabitants of the Highland and of the Dzukia, of their festivals and other traditions and of the usual practices of the Bali Burach.
Some 10000 negatives left in museums and archives have been selected for this publication over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos that have been grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, which are characteristic of cupcakes, dunes, other areas of the Highland and the Land.

A Tragic Marriage: Just After a few hours of Marriage
In the southwestern part of the state of Texas, a couple of young people who had been married just a few hours earlier died during a hurricane disaster.
Twenty-four years old William Troy's Byler and his wife, Bailey Raye Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after midnight after they had boarded the mountain 16 km north-west of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It’s strange that an accident occurred some 20 miles [24 km] away, just as young people were years old.
The pilot of the helicopter at 76 years of age Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
Young people studied at Samo Houston State University, located in the city of Huntsville of Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening at the Byleri family hand next to Juvaldi and after the wedding, they took out a helicopter belonging to the family.
An accident took place about a mile [24 km] from the helicopter.
Young people flew to St. Anthony’s International Airport, where they were going to board an airplane and fly a honeymoon, said Kennedy, noting the ultimate goal of the couple’s trip.
"It's a very rocky, uneven relief area, and that mountain is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. Lawrence has been flying that family aircraft for many years.
According to Mr. Kennedy, he was flying helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After autopsy, it should explain the physical condition of the pilot and whether it could not become the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the lift.
His breakdown looked wide across the rocky mountain slope and the basket remained "dangerously suspended", said flight safety investigator Craigs Hatchas of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) on Monday during the press conference.
The researchers are going to break out and then take a thorough look at them, but the wolf and the truck will not be easy to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published within two weeks.
Israel's prime minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," said B. Netanyahu to members of his Likud parliamentary party, his office reported.
"Today is the day when under the leadership of President Trump (Donaldu Tramp) the United States introduces particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran all the time when efforts have been made to exacerbate its aggression," said the head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier Monday, Israel's defence minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) said that new sanctions would bring a "lethal" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measure, which Washington calls "the strictest sanctions of all time", began to apply after the month of May of the decision to withdraw from the global power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which has already been worth about a million barrels a day since May, and removing Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long opposed this agreement with Iran and says that its scope and time limits are too limited.
The Jewish State also states that the abolition of sanctions has made it possible for Iran to finance fighting groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran’s actions in neighboring Syria and has promised not to allow him to take a military stand there.
The other parties to the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not agree with the US decision and say that the agreement, as has been envisaged, has not yet allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The Court reiterates the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, North Town, will be heard by the court after the accident.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius District Court decided that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness will be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
In the present case, a judgment has already been published, but the prosecution does not agree with it.
On August 22nd, the Vilnius City District Court on the death of a motorcyclist killed the driver of the car when Edward Osipov, 79 years old, announced that the motorcyclist was driving at a high speed in the city and was severely injured.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office requests the District Court to annul the District Court's judgment and states that the greatest fault for the accident lies with E. Osipov and that the judgments of the District Court are not justified.
The lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist’s family is also requested to withdraw the warrant.
The accident occurred on 11 August 2015 about 15 hours when E. Osipovo's car Škoda Fabia from the Lakūn street entered the street of Zyrmūnė and hit the main road motorcycle.
The prosecution accused the man that the driver of the car violated the road traffic rules and caused the traffic event - the man who was driving Piaggo on the main road died.
The original police reports indicate that the engine driver was killed, but later after the tests, it was established that the vehicle is assimilated to a motorcycle according to its capacity.
Judge Roland Bužinskas BNS of the Vilnius City District Court has said that the experts found that the motorcycle driver was traveling 89,2 kilometers per hour, although the speed allowed was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The car driver could not predict that the motorcycle would go at such a high speed," said the judge.
At the time, a respected old car driver claimed to have driven just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the bike, who had found an obstacle, tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before going into contact with Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor’s office believes that on the other hand, when E. Osipov was on his way to the main road, he had to give his way to a motorcyclist.
"New Newspaper": Six "Vagner" fairs died in Syria
Among those killed are five Syrian military forces and six persons belonging to the military company Wagner.
The source of "New Gazette" is published in Syria.
According to a source located in that territory, one of the parts of the 5th Syrian Army Corps, to which a number of Syrian volunteers and "military camps" have joined.
"New Gazette" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting information on the fate of the Russians.
An ex-King of Belgium will have to carry out a fathering test
This decision is a partial victory of artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, it has sought recognition of the former monarch child.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother-in-law, Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love novel.
In the 84th century, the former king denies parenthood.
According to RTBF, he may refer to the Supreme Court, contrary to the DNA investigation.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis - the former husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biological nor legally the father of an artist.
Delphine asked for the relevant investigation to be recognised as the daughter of Albert's "true" father.
It will distribute money to the parties in the PRC, but it will not give anything to the social workers
This week, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LDDP) established this spring, under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Gedimin Kirkilo of Parliament, has not yet been budgeted.
However, they may be allocated to a separate decision of the PRC in the near future if the legal environment changes, which regulates the allocation of grants to the parties.
Ms Matjošaityte, President of the UK, informed VZ that "the Commission's meeting is scheduled to take a decision on the half-yearly allocation of the budget to the parties this Thursday".
According to the Commission, the decision in this regard is to be taken by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to be allocated EUR 2,751 million.
The opposition group of Lithuanian-Christians should receive more than €0.66 million, the governing group of States and the Greens - around €0.55 million, the opposition social-democrat party - about €0.5 million, the opposition group of Liberals - almost €0.4 million, the non-attached working party - around €0.23 million, the recently-attached party of the People's and Justice Party - almost €0.22 million, represented in Parliament, but not the ruling or opposition group of the Polish-Christian family union - about €0.18 million.
In accordance with the law currently in force, which also provides for grants to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of votes during the recent elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to be expected to receive money from the budget.
However, this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers get at least a few hundred thousand euros in the next year's elections - the municipal, president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendment to the budget laws of the political parties and the Seimas was adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė this year.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the governors, Mr Kirkil and the Green Leader of the states, Ramún Karbauski, believe that the parliamentarians will want to reject the President's objections.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's PKK meeting, so, according to Mr Matjošaititė, "the grants will be allocated in accordance with the legal procedure which has been in place so far".
Indeed, the head of the SRC did not reject that if Seimas rejected the President’s veto this week and the new amendments to the budget allocation of the parties to the parties to the parties, a decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including LSDDP, could be considered by the Commission.
"When we take the decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are the implementing authority that has to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If Seimas was able to reject the veto and the new laws would enter into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties, if it had been able to do so.
The seven parties already allocated grants for such a decision would not be affected.

Poroschenka: Activist Handziuk's death orders must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today more than 20 - will not be rejected.
Each will be carefully checked in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to receive information that could harm the conduct of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities are working effectively.
That is how it will be possible to learn the truth and punish the evil," said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he was most interested in explaining the murder of Mr. Handziuk, and that the murderers, the crime organizers and the orderers "would take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been reclassified into murder, they are completely right and reasonably threatened by the death penalty," said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly called the public’s claim to investigate this case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by the representatives of law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government is determined to attract criminals and murderers on the basis of their own responsibility."
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would be even more confusing.
"I call upon all, both the government and the opposition-supporting forces, not to rule out unjustified arguments and, fight God, not to use this murder for public relations," said the president.
- On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and clear, fast - such as to raise public confidence.
We don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation for destabilization in the country," he said.
Prior to the battle of corruption, K. Handziuk was attacked and killed by acid in Cherson City in July.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but she died in the hospital on Sunday.
In the absence of an explanation from the police and the prosecutors of the attack, the Ukrainian Attorney General Jurius Lucenka filed a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, officials were charged with public-acting charges that she was unable to carry out a proper investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Home Affairs.
"I present today my resignation statement," Mr Lucenka told Members of Parliament, reading his investigation report.
Parliament must still support the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka accused the activists of pressuring the investigation and of leaking important information and therefore it was difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates presented the toilet without water
By delivering a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates' transition from traditional such facilities to the waterless like the revolution of the past eight decades computers.
The founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing that does not need water pipes, reported Reuters.
The toilet works without water according to the principle of the separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the biggest achievements in sanitation over the last 200 years," Bill Gates quoted Bloomberg as saying.
A technology toilet was created with funds from the charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
During the seven years it was working with the facility that could convert human waste into fertilisers or water, the fund spent $200 million.
In total, in the words of Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Fund is ready to issue another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under the age of five die each year because of poor sanitation.
The fight against poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, is increasing the amount of health funds that has already reached 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates has a glass of faeces to present the toilet.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand cartilage parasites".

Concern in France: Concern causes people to die
On Monday, French health officials announced a permanent ban on the use of widely used pesticides, causing concern over recent decades of people in the country’s West.
The ANSES Health Agency announced that the decision to ban all products with a pesticide metam was adopted after a new safety check started earlier this year, even before at least three September, in the department of Arto and Luara.
In these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfectant should not be contacted by plant or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used about 700 tonnes each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, complained about breathing problems in the Angie region, where there are many salad juices, eye and throat.
"These episodes confirm the justice of our decision, but they didn't rush it," said French Deputy Director Francoise Weber to West France on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe - the US Environment Agency (US EPA) is called "probably human cancer".
This pesticide, sold by names such as "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is allowed in Europe until 2022 when a new security check has to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether it has alternatives," said F. Weber to that paper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for the producers of salad juices, together with farmers, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad juice consumed in Europe each year is produced by Nanto.
The next season will be "a lot less salad juices, Ridicules and Couples", last month, after the government has stopped using metam, AFP told the news agency of Nanto's Federation of Producers Philippe Retiere (Philipas Retieras).
In the centre of trade with a review wheel, Taline invested EUR 70 million
A new trading centre "T1" opened next weekend in the capital of Estonia, where Pro Capital Group invested EUR 70 million in local real estate (NT).
A total of 130,000 sq.m., or 55,000 sq.m. rented, will operate in the area trading centre at 150 shops or entertainment sites, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, as stated in the development report.
The total area of Vilnius Akropolis (compared with the area for offices) is approximately 110,000 sq. m. And the rent is 91,000 sq. m.
"T1" is the first trading centre with a review wheel installed on the roof, says the developer.
It will begin action at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport ports will also be integrated into the area: there are trams nearby, short-term intercity buses.
The main terminal "Rail Baltica" is also in the vicinity of the area, which is expected to serve about 1 million passengers a year in 2026.
Paolas Michelozzi, Director-General of Pro Capital Group, says that there are significant changes in the global business of malls and that the development of "T1" has succeeded in countering them.
"We have created a new generation trading centre that provides emotions and experience, not accessible online.
This is a place of people's attraction in the city centre itself, the doors of travellers, an impressive and valuable object of interest and at the same time a qualitatively wasted time with friends or family," - the press report quoted Mr Michelozzi.
A lot of attention for entertainment
According to the Trade Centre Manager, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic countries.
A total of 12,000 sq.m. or a fifth of the total area of the rental facility.
The exceptional emphasis is the review wheel installed on the roof.
It will lift the guest up to 120 m above sea level - Tallinn is the tallest only TV tower.
After the review, on the fourth floor, the Super Skypark will operate, which will open the largest battalion centre in Europe and the first in Estonia on the battalion site, says the company.
The interactive SkyLAB research and discovery centre promises children at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will be set up and 360 degrees panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience the virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
Along with visual effects and moving according to the motion of the film chairs, the sense of authenticity here will strengthen the sensations of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smoke, smoke or smoke in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of "T1" is expected to increase the tourist revenue of Estonia by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
"Pro Capital Group" is listed in the Baltic Stock Exchange, as well as in the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year the group in Lithuania received EUR 1.8 million of sales income and suffered losses of EUR 350,000, according to the Financial Report "Pro Capital Group".
In 2016, almost 9 million euro sales revenues were obtained on the Lithuanian market and 2.4 million euro net profits were earned.
Trade Centre "T1" was built by the Estonian company "Merko Ehitus".
President Paul Biya agreed to the seventh term of office in Cameroon after the controversial elections
During the ceremony held by Parliament's President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril 85 years old, Mr Biya promised to preserve the "unitness and unity" of the West African state.
The former African president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was announced in the winning elections held on 7 October, with 71% voting.
However, the elections were subject to low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
P. Inauguration evening 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were buried in one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where the English-speaking separatists carry out the armed campaign for independence.
The majority of the 22 million people in Cameroon are French-speaking and the fifth is English-speaking.
In 2016, in the North West and the neighbouring South West provinces, there was a demand for autonomy in the fields of education, justice and economic discrimination.
In 2017, after refusing to slow down, Mr. Biya declared himself an independent state, an "Ambassian Republic", and raised weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilian and more than 175 security officers died during the separatist attacks and government operations this year.
More than 300 thousand people have fled from violence: some – across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-arid forests.
The elections held in October in the North-West region voted only 5% of the voters, while in the South-West province 15% of the electorate.
In both parts of the country, two-thirds of the votes were taken by Mr Biya.
Primary elections of conservators: errors led to non-exploration
"If there's something missing - you understand that the party has organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their premises to be used, but there were no voting booths everywhere, since we cannot afford them.
Thank you for borrowing," said the politicians.
According to him, complaints have been brought, but their content does not change substantially, and the infringements themselves are not of a bad nature.
"There were complaints.
Not all people who participated in the elections were experienced - they were also new.
Thus, not all actions from this experience were in line with our procedures.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRK to comply with the principles described by us.
These complaints are still not the basis for doubting the results," said A. Anushauskas.
According to the President of the CRC, there have been cases where the ballot papers were not printed - after knowing this, the ballots found in the ballots were cancelled without a stamp.
In some cities, however, there was a lack of seats, according to A. Anusausko, of complaints and violations related to several ten tickets.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it certainly does not make a difference in the results of the election," explained A. Anushauskas.
It is said that the party’s members’ activity in the elections was 55%, while non-partisan voters’ activity was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked on the commissions.
The results published on Sunday also do not change: for the successful Ingrid Shimonyta, 79% of voters (16418 votes), while for Vygauda Ushaka, 21% (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LCD Council will officially support the candidacy of Šimonyte in the elections of the President of the country to be held next May.
A short saying probably won't meet in Putin Paris
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton earlier said that he would meet with Mr. Shorty in Paris, where this week will be the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
However, in his last meeting in front of the U.S. Central Congress elections, Mr. Shortas told reporters that it would be a good opportunity to meet with the President of Russia.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the President of the United States.
However, the President of the White House added, they saw during the G-20 summit and "probably many times" after that.
D. Short continues to try to "overload" relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia is interfering with the 2016 US Presidential elections.
Kastutis Strupa requests the annulment of the VTEK decision
Former Director General of the Hospitals of the University of Vilnius, Santaros, Kęstutis Strupas asks to repeal the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) - he has been recognised as undeclared transactions in time and thus violated the law.
On Tuesday, the Administrative Court of Vilnius of the District of Vilnius examined the complaint.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision on 23 May of the VTEK, the BNS informed the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
K. Strup believes that the gifts granted to loved ones must not be declared, he argues that the exception of the law is so understood.
In May, VTEK announced that the then removed Director General of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and Head of the Hospital Rehabilitation Division of Vilnius University of Vilnius, Silvija Strupienė, violated the provisions of the Law governing the declaration of private interest.
The investigation established that four transactions were declared not to comply with the deadlines: the loan received from the bank in 2010 with the loan received from the bank, the acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, the grant granted to the daughter in 2017, and the loan granted and not repaid to the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by passing the deadlines.
Persons who have infringed the Law on the Coordination of Public and Private Interest in the Public Service shall not be promoted for a year.
The Law requires not only its own, but also its details.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information on the TV.
It is clear whether K. Strupas and his spouse, the head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the University of Vilnius Hospital, S. Strupienė, have properly and in time declared their transactions.
As Info TV announced last year, K. Strupas gave his daughter a real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former Head of Santara's clinic and his wife were not listed in the declarations of interest.
Law enforcement K. Strup, along with at least ten other persons, has reported suspicions in the corruption investigation - namely, legal protection, for the successful public computers, the purchases of software in clinics from companies required for illegal financial remuneration, it is masked as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to say at least five times, during public procurement in Santara's clinics in the field of information technology.
Mr. Strup himself is denying his guilt.
The corruption is suspected by Professor K. Strupas was released from the position of Head of Santara Clinic in September.
In the decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of Santara's clinicians, the working relationship with K. Strupas should be terminated at his own request.
He was in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Santara's clinics continue to be temporarily run by Professor Juozas Rastenskis until the competition to elect the new Director General is announced this year.

In schools you already want to learn differently: promise less tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, after they have been introduced to Vilnius on Monday at the "Change in Educational Content: Foreign Experience for Decisions in Lithuania".
Speaking in the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over the last ten years, over 30 million euros have been invested in the renewal of the content of education, but the results are unexpected.
"In line with the results of the international student achievement study of PISA, students' achievements are below the average of the EFTA countries," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The report by the Ministry of Education and Science quoted by the OECD expert Philas Lamberts (Filas Lamberts) as saying that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuania's general education programmes focus heavily on students' literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility for education, but also on children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
The Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Ms. Grazwidas Kazakevicius, presented changes in the overall content of education, said that the programmes will be reduced during this academic year and will be more concrete, discipline more closely linked.
According to the Deputy Minister, education will be more individualised, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30% of their unique content of education, the current learning evaluation system will change to a cumulative score, greater weight gain and informally acquired competence.
Less standardised tests.
The common education programmes are promised to be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, a bank.
The aim of the renewal of the content of education is to improve the achievement of students in the international PISA study by at least 10%, a third reduction in the gap between the achievements of students, the modern competences acquired at school, in writing in various areas.
Since May 2018, Lithuania has planned to allocate EUR 7.8 million from the European Union and the State budget to the content of education.
It is expected that the project will be tested in part of the schools as of 2019-2020, and from 2021 September it will begin to be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry was criticised for the implementation of a project of nearly EUR 8 million for the initial, main and secondary education for the general programmes of the Education Development Centre.
For four years, €7.8 million was planned, the first purchase of €1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October, which was sought by the development programmers.
After criticizing this purchase, he was suspended, Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė fired Gedrių Vadela, Director of the Education Development Centre.
In Lithuania - exercises how to react to the extreme flood
In Lithuania, a ten-day exercise will begin on Monday to improve the institution's response to the extreme flood.
As informed by the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (PAGD), the exercise will examine how state authorities have been prepared to work in the country following the announcement of the state-level emergency, such as the flood: the elimination of its consequences, the coordination of search for people, the rescue and the rapid expulsion of people from occupied areas, the organisation of their supply of drinking water, food, the necessary supply of energy and the provision of other measures for the protection of the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of the centres for emergency operations in 12 municipalities will take part in the exercises.
On 5-13 November, the preparatory phase of the exercise will take place, during which the municipalities of the Hydrometeorology Service from the PAGD will take decisions on the management of the emergency situation.

The Deputy Director of PAGD Mindaugas Kanapick says that it is important in practice to verify the willingness of the authorities to perform the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibility of exchange of information, to verify how the threat of disaster is prepared to warn and inform citizens, state and municipal authorities, institutions and companies and to "improve the ability to manage state institutions' emergency situations".
Practices will also demonstrate the overall capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump large amounts of water from the occupied areas.
For this purpose, the BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Repudiate Ukrainian Attorney General Jurius Lucenka
Ukrainian Attorney General Jurius Lucenka, speaking in the country's parliament on Tuesday, announced a motion for a motion for a resonance on the death of the acid-filled anti-corruption fighter Katerinas Gandzuk, the Ukrainian news agency Union.net.
Under the Ukrainian laws, the Attorney General's request for resignation must be submitted to the President of the country, and this must be submitted to the Supreme Council for approval by a majority.
On Tuesday, the Attorney General, Mr Lucenko, presented a law enforcement investigation into the execution of the order of murder by Mr Gandzuk and the results of the Supreme Council.
In his speech, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed the regret that Mr. Gandzuk's death was used for public relations.
Mr. Gandzuk was an activist in Ukraine who fought against corruption and spoke publicly about police corruption in the city of Cherson in southern Ukraine.
On 31 July, there was an unknown attack on her house.
On 4 November, she died in a hospital for the injuries she suffered.
Protesters to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine require an answer that killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix in vain.
According to Mr. Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation presents 12 persons who may have been related to the order for the murder of Mr. Gandzuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was lost to the media, which poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Attorney-General, due to the loss of information, the suspects received essential knowledge.
Mr. Lucenko has added a personal acquaintance with Mr. Gandzuk and has been disappointed that some politicians are using her blood in public relations.
"If no one has reason to say that someone who is committed to upholds authority, I want to say that I am making a statement to resign.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in Parliament," said Mr Lucenko in Radio quoted the publication "Obozrevatel".
It is written that Mr. Lucenko added that "it is impossible to let a bi-government in a country where the law enforcement system is broken without any evidence, even for crimes that have been discovered".
Mr Lucenko is considered a close associate of President Petro Poroshenko of the country.
On 12 May 2016, he was appointed as Attorney-General to remove Victor Shokin, suspected of corruption of senior officials and politicians, from this post.
Minister of Energy Z. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta informed the Council of the Minister of Energy Aurelia Vernickaitė, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission's (EC) data, transport - the only sector, which currently has 6% of renewable energy in 2015, without achieving the combined national renewable energy action plans.
In the EC's assessment, progress towards a mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is slow due to various difficulties, including rather high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
Seimas has taken up the issue of the corruption study to complement the conservative referrals to the KT
The Seimas agreed on Tuesday after the submission of such a proposal, which was registered for an investigation into the illegal influence of political processes under the "State" Agna Širinskienė.
For 58 Seimas members, before - 27, nine MPs were detained.
The following draft will be considered by the Seimas Committees appointed primarily by the Committee on Legal and Legislative Affairs, chaired by Mr Širinskienė.
After its conclusion, the decision will be put to the vote on the amendment.
The Seimas interim investigation commission is currently conducting a new political corruption investigation to explain the possible illegal impact in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed that this deadline should be extended by indicating that "in the public space there has been significant information on the possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and public institutions".
A. Širinskienė lists in the project "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of important independent institutions such as the Central Commission for Official Ethics".
When referring to the Constitutional Court for pensions, the opposition Conservatives initiated.
The "States" authorities have found that the Conservatives have largely supported the arguments of private pension funds lawyers.
The leaders of the "States" of the General Commission for Official Ethics (VTEK) accuse the former colleague Povil Urbš.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Management Committee for the State and Municipalities of the Seimas could have instructed the members of the VTEC to resign the former Head of the Commission's Prevention Division, Mindaugas Săur.
At the end of September, the Seimas set up a commission to explain the potential illegal influence of interested persons or groups, the impact of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual policies, the activities of parties and public movements and the financing of the Commission, the legislative processes, the appointment of public-run companies, the heads of public institutions, the selection of members of management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to consider what information the law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities as they have responded to it.
The researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
At that time there will be a campaign by the President, the European Parliament.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of the "States".
Its members also appointed two social workers, after one "order", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian-Christian family union of elections.
The Conservatives and the Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
A new investigation was initiated by the President of the ruling Lithuanian States and the Green Union, Ramūnas Karbauskis.
According to him, a study carried out by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSSC) at the previous session basically showed that the study should be continued on the same grounds.
The German Internal Intelligence Manager has lost his post
H. G. Maassen's 55th controversy was further exacerbated by his claim that the "radical left forces" were responsible for his troubles at the Merkel Coalition.
As a result, he was not moved to another post as promised before, but was forced to leave for the reserve.
Among other things, last weekend it became clear that, several weeks ago, Mr Maassens criticised the immigration policy of Mr Merkel at the meeting of representatives of the European Internal Intelligence Organisations in Warsaw.
For a long time after defending the intelligence leader, German Minister for the Interior Horst Seehofer said at the press conference on Monday that the previous comments by Mr. Maasseno were unacceptable and "intimate".
Mr Seehofer, himself being pressured by both this dispute and the poor appearance of his party in Bavarian local elections, asked President Franco-Walter Steinmeier to release Mr Maasseni into custody.

Body girls tear stereotypes about wedding dresses
She's wearing a white puppie dress - a mission (no) possible?
Can the white floor flying towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
In addition to the size of reality, the participants in the show "Divine (r) Evolution" will today prove that beauty and elegance are certainly independent of women's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project tonight will be happy crying - her boyfriend will appear on the filming site.
"There are some who think that older girls are not waiting for boys' attention or attention.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but he likes me what I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets some standards," - before showing up with a wedding dress, Aurika's talk show.
The wedding dress is not easy, in all respects, clothing is a complex design, it contains a lot of material, dress difficult, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women feel that the older girl in the white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident about herself.
I can bet that a properly chosen dress model is really solving this problem," explained one of the panel members, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The girl's remains in the project R. Kalinkinas decides together with the whole commission - in addition to the size of fashion houses opened by Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social network star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Poukšte.
"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are lots of circles between the members of the commission - because we all represent different spheres and we imagine the winner differently.
The task of demonstrating the wedding dress is still difficult, and this - I can tell now - is that there have been two young people who have not really been worse than the old-fashioned ones.
It was a special evening in every sense," says Kalinkin.
In a scandalous 23-year-old summer reality show, Ieva and 31-year-old Dovilė – like the other girls, took part in the selection of "Divine (r) Evolution" and entered the best 20 years.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of the girls in Vilnius City, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl returned to the show by LNK viewers, voting for her favorites on the television portal.
There is already a second week after the international recognition of the beauty of the community show in Lithuania – there is a plus-size girl fighting for the name of the first country plus-size star.
So far they've only been eight -- and they all know perfectly well that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Divine (r) Evolution" starts this Monday evening at 20.30 a.m. during the LNK.
Actor I. Elba selected by the sexiest man in the world
The U.S. magazine People published this year as the sexiest man in the world.
He became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, he did not have the courage to speak about the new title.
I thought, "Can't be!
Really?
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexually today - when I'm laughing at the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris mentioned that this title is a very pleasant feeling that devoured his ego.
The British star often believed that he was "very tall and rude" because of what made his childhood difficult.
The young actor did not believe in and become an object of trust for the common people, and because of his rare and unusual name and African origin.
"I've just caught you in the thick and the muscle I'm going to be the toughest guy in my city district," smiles Idris.
When men fail to be proud on the Ose screens, I. Elba works at discourses in the evenings held in Spain and especially in the stormy Ibiza.
In time, a man enjoys the Thai boxing and has a stylish fashion that is made by making his own clothes line.
The British actor believes that he is the most important person in the world - a family, so he plans to marry a promising Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the most sexually elected man in the 33rd People magazine.
The title was applied to Blake Shelton in 2017.
A man who died in the ravages of the ravages
On Monday evening, a man died in the village of Širvinti, in the village of Šalkiski.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a.m., a report was received that a man had killed his neighbor during drinking.
When the doctors arrived, they found the death of a man born in 1943.
Detained in 1994, the suspect was born with 2.53 prom alcohol.
The police explain the circumstances of the incident.
Governors shall no longer require 20 km in the construction of waste incineration plants
The Vilnius cogeneration plant is located next to the Gariún market.
The authorities are no longer concerned that the construction of waste incineration plants will take place 20 kilometres from the habitat.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee, "State" Kęstutis Mažeika, registered on Monday in Seimas an amendment to the Waste Management Act which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr Majeiko, the 'States' Group, which had previously supported the 20 km-long clause, has promised to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment provides that as of January 2019, waste incineration plants could be subject to environmental and public health requirements laid down by law.
He acknowledges that the amendment prompted the President's doubts about such an insurance.
"In view of the definition of the dwelling area, it is clear that such places where the objects mentioned above can be constructed are almost impossible to find," says the Committee's Chairman.
The ruling majority opposed the President's veto amendments in October to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the construction of waste incineration plants more than 20 km from the habitats, the amendments provided for an authorisation for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already in place, taking into account public health interests.
Mr Mažeika does not propose any adjustments.
"Lithuania Energy" and "Fortum Heat Lithuania" in Vilnius, together with Fortum Heat Lithuania in Finland's energy group.
The latter is already burning the remains in Klaipeda.
This is a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations.
On Monday, British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the difficult issue of Northern Ireland, which is undermining the Brexit negotiations, Dublin reported.
In speaking on the telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a revision of the so-called 'insurance arrangement' mechanism which would allow for an open border between the Province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which belongs to the European Union.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any opportunity for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from this agreement, as stated in the report published by the Irish Government.
In the conversation, Th. May "has created an opportunity to review the insurance mechanism", it states.
"The Speaker has made it clear that it is open for a review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not related to the unilateral decision to terminate the application of insurance measures," the government report says.
The Brexit negotiators do not take a decision on how to avoid checks at the UK and Ireland's land border when Britain withdraws from the Single Market and Customs Union next year's fight.
The two parties agree on 'insurance measures' to maintain an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be temporarily applied to the entire United Kingdom.
On Monday, The Daily Telegraph reported that the secretary of Brexit, Dominica Raabas, aims to enable Britain to withdraw from the insurance agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"For three months or a limited period, insurance measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
Previously, London and Brussels did not confirm information on the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations following a week's report in Britain that the agreement is reached by hand.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," said Th. May's representative in London.
European Commission representative Margaritis Schina also told reporters: "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a statement calling for the right to obtain reliable information during the Internet era.
Among the 25 persons who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Senas (Amartja Senas) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglicas), the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Marius Vargas Liosa).
"We encourage good will leaders in all countries to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts," says the Group's report.
They argue that the "global area of information and communication" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views".
"People have a fundamental right to obtain information that is freely collected, processed and distributed on the basis of commitment to justice, the principles of pluralism and the rational methods of determining facts," the authors added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump (Donald Trappa), who often criticises "unreal news", but who is regularly accused of distorting facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when the signatories called for a meeting to be held in Paris from 11 to 13 November.
This declaration was prepared within two months, under the direction of Mr. Ebadi and Mr. Christophe Deloire (Christophe Deloire), the Head of the Freedom of the Media and Journalist Rights Organization established in Paris, Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Among the other signatories are former Senegalese President Abdou Dioufas (Abdu Dioufas), Chinese Lawyer and Human Rights Activist Teng Biao and Politologist Francis Fukuyama (Francis Fukuyama).
The Seimas passed more penalties than harmful products
The Seimas agreed with the amendments to the Product Safety Law providing that penalties for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were accepted unanimously in the sitting room.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Health Committee, said about the new project, welcomes the promotion of objectives related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions are also compatible with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed draft law, is better and more specifically allocated to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, because the entities who have paid the fine continue to commit repeated infringements," said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and was complemented by its proposals by the Seimas Economic Committee after the Government's approval.
The legislative amendments aim to increase penalties for infringements, to strengthen consumer protection, to give market surveillance authorities more power and to create a clear system of product safety requirements and their enforcement.
As stated by the Ministry of Agriculture, there is currently no obligation for producers to mark the product properly and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, the Ministry said that the market surveillance authorities did not have the right to access the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises, inspection, and this made the work of the authorities difficult.
The evaluation of the Ministry, the six-month deadline for the award of fines and warnings, is too short to establish a violation, conduct an investigation and appoint a penalty.
Also, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
The company often repeatedly violates the requirements of the law - only during 2017 it did so by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Agriculture proposed that producers should be obliged to properly label the product and ensure its traceability in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to explain to suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to access the premises, premises and premises of operators who manufacture, supply products on the market.
The aim is to increase penalties for violations of the law.
A penalty of EUR 150 to 2,500 (now EUR 144 to 1,448) would be granted to the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative of products which are dangerous on the market and to the distributor, which are available on the market.
A fine of EUR 1 000 to EUR 5 000 (now EUR 868 to 4,344) would be awarded to the State Consumer Rights Authority (CPC) or other market surveillance authority after its decision to prohibit the placing on the market and the supply of dangerous products or services.
Without a requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2500 to EUR 6 500 (now EUR 1 448 to EUR 5 792) would be granted.
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of EUR 2 500 to 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to 11584) would be granted.
If dangerous products resulted in the death of the consumer, a fine of EUR 6 500 to 25 000 (now EUR 5 792 to EUR 23 169) would be awarded.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, the infringement of product safety legislation is awarded a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (minimum fine not established), in Belgium, from EUR 26 000 to EUR 600 000, in Romania, from EUR 155 to EUR 6 666, in Bulgaria, from EUR 125 to EUR 7,500.

The Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO's most remote and northern practices
The Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital of Oslo.
This is part of NATO's "Trisaka Journey 2018" exercises - the biggest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second Norwegian military battalion after the 11th of September spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are capable of fighting the Arctic, and these skills are very useful now that NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, in the east of Tinset in the mountains, often in the remotest and northern areas, the military took part in the staged battles against true British soldiers.
The soldiers have the ability to survive in this source in the wild, but in the open climate they have to try a much higher weight on their shoulders - one bag weighs about 50 kg.
In the lead, the military states that they share with other NATO soldiers their skills in surviving and fighting under such conditions.
According to the military, this practice, which as no other particularly resembles actual warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

The Eastern European Centre for Studies will cooperate with two major US brain centers
According to the director of RESC Lino Kojala, who has been established in Vilnius for thirty years, the US will implement projects and will make Lithuania's voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two major institutions see us as partners and seek opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will occur, as we are looking at NATO, security, disinformation, East Partnership development issues are also their priority," Kojala said.
The Agreements indicate that the REC and the US authorities will work together in the preparation of international projects, will exchange expertise and knowledge on expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have a great international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and has been joining almost a hundred top-level analysts.
The newest university of Pennsylvania in the world rating of analytical centres FPRI took the seventh place in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, who have been invited by analysts to consult and work with the US' highest political institutions, is ranked ten in the same rating.
"This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information area and will encourage us to raise a quality card up," added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in the distribution of the forthcoming RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" between US decision-makers and public space.
The Eastern European Research Centre operates on the basis of projects to be implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
These include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
