Majors (AM) Welsh is worried when they look like a muppet doll.
There is concern among some AMs about a suggestion that their term should be changed to MWPs.
This is because there is a plan to change the name of Majelis to the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs throughout the political spectrum are worried if that could lead to riots.
One AM working party said that the group was concerned, "The call is still with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirty.
One expert (AM) said that his group was one union, felt "uneasy" and had suggested some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group "open-minded" about the change of name, but it estimated that this was an introduction from MWP's short to Muppet.
In this context, the English word w in Welsh is rendered like the English word u in Yorkshire.
The current Majelis Commission has ordered the laws to introduce the change in the name, saying, "The final decision on any explanation of the term for the AM is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The decision by the Walesn government in 2017 gave the chance to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on a well-known proposal that received extensive support for the appointment of a journalist as a Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the problem of AMs, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Wellsh), but MWP options get the most support in public consultation.
The AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can dissociate the leader, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over these legal changes in a few weeks' time.
These reform laws will cover changes-- other changes about how to work in the art, including rules of discalification for AMs and committee system plans.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss laws.
The Macedonian people went to give a vote on a referendum on the change of country name
Speakers will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia."
The call was made in an effort to settle a dispute for a decade with a Greek - speaking neighbor, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country on its north side shows an acknowledgement of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the European Union and NATO membership bid.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the voice call to change his name, has said that he will ignore the voice call.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Lonceng was not interested when the churches in Harlem had trouble.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say before there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adam
"Today, there is no one."
He said that all the bars disappeared could be explained.
"People are socializing in another way" now, she says.
"It's no longer the public's guest room around where people regularly visit it."
Likewise with the church, he was concerned that the proceeds of the sale of assets would not last long as expected by the leaders, "and sooner or later they will return from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced with an apartment building with condominium filled with people who won't help keep the sacred places around him.
"The majority of people who buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why they're going to speed up the day where these churches close together because they can't possibly move into those condominiums and become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white community before Harlem became the metropolis city of the Black people of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade later.
The White Methodis was originally moved in the 1930s.
The blacksmiths who had worshiped in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black crowd under the leadership of Prince John Howard, who led a small boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping route in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The flames of 1939 devastated the building, but when Prince Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they built a tower.
Prince David Johnson, son of Prince Johnson and his replacement in St. Martin, proudly referred to the tower bell as the "Lonceng of the Poor People"
An expert who sounded the tower bell in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an unaltered historical instrument."
One expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black leather musicians, Dionysius A. Lind, who turned to sound the largest tower bell in the 18 years ago of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in Santo Martin in the last few months was a complex architectural and contractor story, some brought by the public church leaders, and others brought by the bishops.
Westy's--the board of directors, made up of public leaders-- wrote to the board in July with concern that the board "will strive to weigh the costs" on the board of the board of directors, although the Westy is not involved in the aegis of architects and contractors sent by the board of directors.
Some parishioners have undermined the transparency of the authorities.
Hyu injured a teenager 13 years of age in a lobster raid in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he drowned to catch a lobster in California at the opening of the Lobster season, the flood of an officer.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had drowned with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then sneezed into groups to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an act of joy after he caught the Lobster, but then he "awarely" that the boy shouted, "I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
All the bones are broken," Hammel said that he realized it when he had the child.
I called out to all the people, saying, ‘There is a lion in the water!’
The boy was taken to the Son’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was treated in a critical situation.
The type of shark that is responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles of the Coast Rescue said in a media conference that a shark had seen in the area a week before, but it was categorised as harmless shark species.
Giles adds that the victim has severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officers have closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the Swami in Ecinita for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sciencebury's article breaks England's beauty market
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with a kioos-kios beauty of the weaponry controlled by specialist assistants.
As part of the substantial drive to the UK beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household appliances down, the largest beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more next year's stores if that proves to be successful.
Investment in beauty is a hunting pond for supermarkets to take advantage of which formerly used as a TV stand, microwave, and home appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would represent a great deal of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
A range of brands that are currently starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the area of the shooting as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its store array so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans who were becoming more interested in young returnees.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's perfumer will test the concession in two stores of Sciencebury, the first opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Online shopping and purchasing daily food needs in a small number of local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to get people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of Sciencebury, has said that soon will be more visible as Mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back the crews like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no food.
Sciencebury has quickly placed Argos in hundreds of stores and has also introduced some Habitats since they bought both of them two years ago, who said it has supported the sale of food for days and made a more advantageous claim.
The previous supermarket to upgrade the beauty department and pharmacy ended up with failure.
Sciencebury tested the cutting effort with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a dispute about how to share the benefits of the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy emerged after Sciencebury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Farms' lobby, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the article, adding a variety of excellent skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We've changed appearances and nuances on beauty kiosks to improve the environment for our visitors.
We also invest with our trained coworkers who will be willing to offer advice.
Our range of brands are designed to suit all needs, a tight environment and a comfortable location.
Peter Jones' voice after Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a $11 million worth of deal.
Star Dragons Den, Peter Jones went "with anger" after the TV show Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a life-style business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to control the branding of their homeware and their accessories, True.
The business of this couple is compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's broadcaster, 37 years old, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Pete Jones angry with being attracted to the last few moments, from the lifestyle business of those who benefit - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source states that Jones was so "slow" when the golden girl admitted during the meeting on Tuesday at his business center's office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new deal -- worth up to £1.5 million -- meant he didn't have enough time to serve himself on the trademarks of their homeware and their accessories, True.
Their business has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says, "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be a long future, which would make it last for a few decades to come.
His decision to step back upsets all who are involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, really close to the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office that's ready to sell."
The experts believe that this Morning, one of England's most expensive stars, can damage companies up to millions of dollars because of large investment in product form, from waistbands and candles to clothing and household equipment, and there are potential for further launch.
And this could mean that it ended a long-lasting friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby set up True with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in leadership in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the stock on Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trade fair for the M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the I'm A Celebrity I'm.
A reporter close to Jones said last night, "We won't be commenting on this business relationship."
Talking seriously 'and then we fall in love'
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the news media because he made a comment that some people thought was "unpresidial" and had been very positive towards North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said with the voice of his "new-reader"'s.
"I don't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting him the second time after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for revealing North Korea.
But the negotiations on disarmament have been halted.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, spoke to world leaders on Saturday's UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see any "response" from the United States for the early arms movement in North Korea.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States continued to apply sanctions designed to keep the pressure under control.
Trump looks more optimistic in the series of talks.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship,"
He said that his efforts to repair Kim’s relationship had brought positive results — stopping rocket attempts, helping to free hostages, and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he's defending his unbridled approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the right crowd in front of him.
Tsunami Indonesia and Tsunami Destroyed an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there is no national declaration of disaster, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have explained that they do not ask for international assistance, so this is somewhat challenging," Mrs. Sumbang said.
While Save The Children are arranging a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Father Sutopo, the judge of the National Disaster Management Board, said that the Indonesian office was investigating the situation in Palu to see if the foreign authorities were allowed to contribute.
In view of the earth’s continued invasion of Indonesia, the country is not yet ready to face natural wrath.
While the tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on the other shoreline.
There was no tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was already reported, it was likely that the victim’s life was spared.
At the best of times, travel among many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The miner’s hospital located in Lombok in order to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading toward the Pale, but it will take at least three days to reach the new location.
President Joko Widodo has made broken Indonesian infrastructure repairs as the essence of the election campaign, and he has spent money on building highways and railways.
But the lack of funds disturbed Father Joko’s rulership while he was faced with a resurgence of elections next year.
Joko’s father also faced the pressure of the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced the form of more conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when the Muslim and Christian factions fought in the streets, used weapons, guns, and other hard weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea at the Premier League with one score in a minute at 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge got a hold of Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea when his team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left before he threw it away.
The ball hovers high above the bow when the ball hovers to the right of the chain.
The ball finally fell through the head of the storm that jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much of it, and just make a move."
Chelsea led by score 1-0 in the first half of the day after the Belgian Eden Hazard scored the goal in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave Matthew Kovacic the lure back to the game, before turning close to the center line and running fast to the center of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave up and ran in the middle line.
He then made a perfect swing, led by Hazard to the bow.
Hazard made it through the back of the opponent and shot the ball into the middle of the gang with his left leg, through the Liverpool Alison Becker.

The image of the Parliament of Cromwell is the last monument to be commemorated by the 'reign of history'
The exile will be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many of the cultural and religious artifacts of the British people of the phantom Puritans.
But Cromwell's society describes Mr. Crick's advice as "crazy" and "trying to re-write history."
John Goldsmith, head of Cromwell's Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the debate at this time about the destruction of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace will be targeted.
The British Brotherhood War iconoclass is neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendant of Cromwell would have been sacrificed to his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The extraordinary representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is a 19th-century evidence of opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many people, perhaps by the end of the 19th century than today, as a parliamentary advocate against outside pressure, in the case of course the government.
Whether it is a completely accurate representation, still subject to a chaotic debate in history.
Which is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is a person who can be known as an individual who represents one side of that difference.
It is for him to be remembered and to be warned."
Killer Pigs Hunting the Chinese Farm to the End
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
A man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found to die with a broken artery, flowing blood near a pig market in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reports on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject the vaccine to pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of the pighouse near him opened.
He says there's a big baby pig in the pig's skull with blood in his mouth.
Scientific research confirms that the female pig weight of 550 pounds has persecuted the farmer until his death, according to the report.
"It's my cousin's blood and destruction," says the cousin who's known as "Wu," as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his grandparents.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed that man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already detained to prevent anyone from attacking, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities were reported to be self-extinguishing compensation for his death.
Although rarely, the cases of a pig attack on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused the injured man to become seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 650 pounds to the tractor to scare the wife and drive the animal out.
After a farmer named Oregon was eaten by his grandfather in 2012, a farmer named Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually non-aggressive but blood flavourings can act as "pemicu".
"They're just playing games.
They bite, they want to know... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give her enough respect," she said.
The rest of Rosa's storm brought their heavy rains to the west of the United States.
As it is estimated, the Rosa storm is weakened when it moves on the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will cause rains throughout the northern and western parts of Mexico to come a few days later.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, starting at 5am. Day of the week time of the Eastern Region, and located 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's probably heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Palun began to form above the Pacific Ocean and moved east, toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in part of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropics that interacted with the closest of kin will produce abundant rains in the spirit’s west for a number of days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous torrents, thorny streams and the possibility of longsorbing in the sandfield.
The low tropical humidity will cause the rainfall levels to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected to fall in some parts of the West of the Spirit, especially in most of Arizona.
The torrential flood is likely to occur with a rapidly deteriorating condition because of the widespread tropical rain.
It's not very recommended to travel the desert by walking on foot because of a tropical rain threat.
The rains of this system of things can cause the floods of storms, floods, and storms to take place at a low point in the vicinity of the earth.
The nearest one will cause local rains to fall to part of the southern California coast.
The total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small dunes to flow and the highway to become a lynch.
It'll be the first rain in that area in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of the week and Monday morning, before the rain gets wider on Monday and Tuesday.
The torrential rains would spread to four o'clock on Tuesday and endure to Rabu.
In October there will be some great temperature changes across the United States when the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropical region remains quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes in the short term.
There is an accurate example of the dramatic difference between temperature and temperature across the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There is a difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the heat of the rest of the summer will grow and rekindle.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start hot in October at an 80s spread speed from the South Sea to the eastern parts of the sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance for temperatures above averages for the eastern United States by mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people saw an interesting statement on Thursday by the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused of sexual violence that was expected to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with some publishers launching a regular event to report an unexpected incident in the last minute of Friday: An agreement by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate the charge for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh was squeezing her body in a drunken state and trying to get her clothes off at the middle school party.
Kavanaugh, in his burning testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were watching it.
The company counted the percentages of emeritus in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks that broadcast this thing is not available fast, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually had trouble counting the number of people watching him in the office.
To put this into perspective, that's the number of spectators almost equal to the playoff football game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who believes that its performers are very supportive of Kavanaugh's show, is superior to all networks with an average of 5.69 million bridesmaids throughout the day, says Nielsen.
ABC has a second position with 3.26 million demersals.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million prostitutes and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the trial.
Flake was the key actor in the drama that Friday night.
After the office of the moderate Republican Party issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN camera and CBS on Friday morning being shouted by the prosecutor when he tried to climb to the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was kicked, broadcast directly at CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have strength when there are many helpless women."
Flake said that his office had issued statements and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee.
The cable TV and the broadcasting network all wrapped up directly a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee will choose to advance Kavanaugh's campaign to the whole Senate for a call.
But Flake said he would only do it with an understanding that the FBI would investigate charges against the brave for a week ahead, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been assured by some of the talks with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
Talking to Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
The Flake option has power, because it is clear that the Republican party will not have the voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accused the critic of 'playing politics' of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critic of playing politics with Britain's future and undermines national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed an attack on what he called a Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal on Britain and the EU that should collect tariffs is "full of nonsense."
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested the suspect Dytheon Simpson in the death of the LSU player.
Police caught a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has also been arrested and in prison with a two-level murder charge, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Confrontation video starring between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his eyes during the fight.
Police found those glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson DNA on that thing, the WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he confessed he had done a fatal shooting against Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The Coroner Paroki Baton Rouge's office in the East reports that on Friday, the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the head until it hits the neck.
It thanked the Department for the tireless mission of the Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, the Southern University police, and the surrounding people to help investigate leading to arrest.
Athletic director LSU Joe Alleva thanked the local lawmakers for "imprisonment and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old then.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Average points are 5.6 and ranged to 2.6 in the game last summer.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said his team felt "destroyed" and "sudden" with Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," says Wade.
Firefighting Mounts in Mexico City
The abou that came out of the Mount of Fire Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warns Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the fires after the activity has increased in the field and has been registered for 183 gas and sand emissions in the past 24 hours.
The center was a series of shocks and shocks.
The pictures in the social media show a tiny gray layer that is lying on the front of the car in the vicinity of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in fire mountain activity that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the city's capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit Mexico in the middle of September 2017.
This Mount Fire is known as Don Goyo, which has been active since 1994.
The police are setting up with Catalan separatists to celebrate the independence election.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting pro-independence clashes with the anti-disaster police, and when thousands joined the demonstration to mark the first polling party in Catalonia about suicide.
A group of pro-separatists who were detained by the anti-ice police were forced to throw them with eggs and throw a bubbling paint, so creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The argument also followed that day with a police officer who used their stick to control the dispute.
For a few hours, groups of pro-independence groups were shouting "Don't forget, there's no forgiveness" in front of a union of workers calling out, "Hiup Spaniard."
Fourteen people were treated for the minor injuries they received in the protest, reports the local press.
A year after the October 1st referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists, remains a high - pressure area.
The electorate prefers to be modest, although the number of low-choices is limited by some who oppose self-determination and most of the electorate.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the voice calls on the Internet throughout the region in a severe earthquake.
Pro-independence groups have camped at night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in national police ranks.
Demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence from Catalonia’s prospects.
"Last year we spent one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry because they can choose, but now we're trapped," he said.
Although it succeeded in achieving a vital victory even in a few in the December regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have fought to defend this moment this year, although many of their well-known leaders, who are in solitary confinement or in prison, are awaiting trial, on their role in organizing referendums and further declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with her cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been handled by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting tougher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalan who have been imprisoned for the past year since the end of last year, announced that he would compete in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to jeopardize the return to the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a car broke down a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage happened at the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been shot in the direction of the car at a few points.
The goal being printed by Menga has won for Livingstone over Rangers with score 1-0
First goal Dolly Wants for Livingston to make sure he wins
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers firing Steven Gerard from his position as manager of the Ibrox Club, due to both defeats in 18 matches.
The Dolly Menga attack has proved that there is a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is similar to the Hibernian in second order.
Gerrard's side remains unbeatable in the Prime Ministership this summer and faces the leaders of Hearts who are eight points in front of them, the next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers were eating Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeatable record in the division to six matches, while Coach Holt's head still suffered a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost his chance against a dirty guest team
Team Holt was supposed to be superior long before they scored the goal, with their precision giving Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his efforts failed to cross the border, and then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after he entered and face Craig Halkett's flood from across the border.
The housekeepers are pleased to let Rangers play great at first, knowing that they can trouble the arrival team on the event of the death ball.
And that's how to create a very important goal.
Rangers of free movement and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and print a goal from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers has dominated power but realized that the defense of the house is unbeatable and Liam Kelly's caper is completely uninhibited,
The pattern continued until the second episode, although Alfredo Morelos managed to catch the rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was arrested by the guards Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow far removed as a result of the other Livingston tactics.
The attack continues to come to Livingston's cage and continues to avoid, while two claims of cowards - after the Halkett challenge on Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one for handball - are rejected.
The Phenomenal of Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and the phenomenal results for Livingston.
For a man, they're amazing, they're still beyond hope on the journey that's going on.
The style of the game and their personnel have hardly changed since they got back to the board, but the big loan has to be given to Holt about how he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He's got so many jaguains.
Captain Halkett is very big, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall on guard during the game.
Nevertheless, Rangers lacks inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less good-- only once they could break the formation of the side of the house-- and it became a reminder to Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan's got a different reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue contrast on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO's allies.
They argue about problems including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police pointed out a reason for the security of the crowd to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the assembly, but many of the supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters -- many of them Kurdish -- also shouted, threatened both, Erdogan's politics and the German government's decision to welcome him to that country.
Protests depicting a resistance to the existence of a stranger who was welcomed as a hero by some Turkish citizens and was sought out as a dictator by others.
Deptford Street Strikes: Bike lifts killed in the deck by car
A motorcycle driver died in a parking lot that involved a car in London.
It happened near Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, many streets in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
Tabrakan happened months after another bike driver died in a camp on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from that camp on Saturday.
Metro police say the officers are trying to identify the man and preach to his family.
The roads were closed and the bus routes were handled, and motorists were driven to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers in riots
Six people are more likely to suffer injury in an accident in a man's prison with close custody, the office said.
The chaos occurred at the Long Lartin HMP prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and continues.
Specialist "Tornado" has been commissioned to handle the cover, which involves eight prisoners and happens on one side of the building.
Officers are being treated at the scene because of slight injuries in the face.
One lawyer said: "The specially trained blade officer has been hired to handle the incident that is happening in Long Lartin's HMP prison.
Six officers have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate the violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible person will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time in return for the Iron Curtain."
The HMP Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous hostages.
In June it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a paramedic.
And in October last year, an anti-circumvention officer was called to prison to deal with a serious complaint where a police officer was attacked with a billiard.
The Red Storm threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Bandang River
The tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely happens, but that's what's probably going to happen early next week because of the energy trail of the Rosa storm that's left over the west desert, causing a slow flood risk.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning that there will be a flood on Monday and Tuesday for the West Arizona region to South Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is supposed to be driving right through Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit Monday night with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical peaks capable of causing tropical storms or depression in the 200-mile Phoenix area since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest Emergency Center equipment is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rain with a number of isolations reaching 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other western desert areas including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with probably 4 inches in isolation.
For those in the barren area, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although the flood is a serious problem, some of this rainstorm is likely to benefit because it is now under drought in the western part of the world.
According to the U.S. U.S. Dehydration Observer, only about 40 percent of Arizona's area experienced a little extreme dehydration, the second highest category," weather.com reports.
First, the route through the Red Storm leads to the mainland of California on the Mexican coast
Rosa, still at the weather on Sunday morning at 85 miles per hour wind speed, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour speed.
The storm struck a region that was colder in the Pacific, and for that reason its strength was weak.
Therefore, it is expected that they will land in Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rains may be high in parts of Mexico, causing high flood risk
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected to reach the subcontinent of California to the western region of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border today as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and into the South Utah at midnight.
"The main risk that may be caused by the Rosa storm or the rest of it is a very high rainfall in Baja California, the western Sonora region, and the U.S. western region of the U.S. desert." The National Disaster Centre (NHC) said.
The rains are expected to threaten the valley and the plains of buildings that flow into the wilderness, and it happens to be a longsorbing land in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton's attack: capture of four suspects attempted murder
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a painful wound in Somerset.
The boys were found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
One 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds, and one 20 - year - old were arrested last night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, says the police.
The officer has been stalking anyone who might have had that video of the incident on his phone to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'accepts hatred and anger' from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice to reject the harsh and humiliating position of the Democratic Party," Trump said on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "receiving hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the process of embezzlement
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, with forced and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed sexual violence to him a few decades ago while they were still a teenager.
Ford was also present at the trial of his statements.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the wisdom and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice to affirm someone who has the most perfect legal thought in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said to a group of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's appeal when discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before it happens one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I went there to fight for a great horse.
Trump argues that the Democrats are on the mission to "oppose and block."
The first hearing procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's proposed campaign could be carried out as late as Friday, an assistant senior leader of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds of people died because of Indonesia's tsunami, with an increase in casualties.
At least 384 people died, many drowned when giant waves hit the beach, when the earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian Sulawesi Island, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in Palu on Friday, when a wave of six feet (18 m) of rock destroyed the beach at evening, causing many deaths and destruction of everything it had been through.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running so quickly as to become victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a lawyer for the Disaster Management Board (BNPB) said at the summit in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged the car, wood, house, barking everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before crossing the shoreline.
Some climb trees to save themselves from tsunamis and survival, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 service centers in Palu.
The GNPB’s air - photo shows a number of ruined buildings and shops, bridges and trenches, and a museum surrounded by water.
The torrential storm struck the city along the beach on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Survey (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released at the mass storm that Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb force dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of the long narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, can be said.
Nugroho describes the damage that occurred as "extensive" and says that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of a ruined building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured victims and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be larger along the 300 km (190 miles) beach line north of Palu, a region called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the Earth’s quake.
The communication "is really lame with no information from Dongala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and their volunteers are heading to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency concerned on Saturday received many criticisms because it did not inform them that there was a tsunami that struck Palu, although the authorities said that the wave had hit when the warning was issued.
An amateur tape shared in social media shows a man on the floor on a building that sounds like he's alarming that there's going to be a close tsunami, towards the people on the street below.
In the minutes of the floodwaters, the building and the car were destroyed.
Reuters cannot immediately prove the authenticity of the record.
Storms and tsunamis are the biggest cause of the collapse of electricity storage around Palu so that authorities find it difficult to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The military has already begun to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and its other cities, the authorities say, but refugees still need food and other necessities.
The airport has been reopened just to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami victims increased by 800.
That's very scary.
When World Vision officials from Dongala had succeeded safely in the city of Palu, where the officers were sheltered in the tent cloths built in their office yard, they had crossed through various areas of porous, said Father Dossaba.
"They told me that they had seen many ruined houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when a group of donors began to move slowly to start disaster management activities, some of those groups found themselves fighting off foreign volunteers who had skills, who were going to go to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, torture, relief, and power from outside the country can only begin if the disaster area has been officially declared as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a professor speaking for the Indonesian Red Palace.
"When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but there is not yet that status."
On the second night, the people of the town of Shu'aib hoped that those whom they loved would be part of a miracle that would bring about the end of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young man was expelled from the prison.
On Sundays, the rescuer released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a national Indonesian paramilitary coach, has become a coach for two missing paramilitary athletes, capable of following Asian Games that ended early this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in Hotel Roa-Roa, with Father Monday, are his disciples.
"As a senior in the field of paralysis, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Father Gendon tells us again how after the news of the ruined Roa-Roa Hotel departed around the paramilitary community, he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who also attended a party on that beach.
Even so, all his messages, got just one sign of the blue light, not two blue light.
"I thought it meant an unsent message," he said.
The kidnappers took $26,750 during ATM landings at Newport in Levee
A robber on Friday morning, stealing $26,750 from a Brink officer who's re-filling the ATM machine storage box in Newport, based on a call from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver has emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is ready to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in an announcement.
While he was at work, another man ran behind Brink's staff and stole one bag of money that would be sent.
The Witnesses saw some suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not mention the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change of name through Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote: "The former formally known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has been called Ye for some time and uses that name as his eighth album title, which was released in June.
Those changes were made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to score his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to show on the show, which was cancelled because of "emotional reasons," says the show creator.
As a short for his professional name at the moment, earlier West said that for him the word had religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing the album title with the publishers of Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
The name was taken from Kanye, which means only, to be Ye-- as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true self."
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of Great Links and Letters.
Mexican President AMLO swore not to use military in the face of civil society
The President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn he will never use military force against civil society until the 50th anniversary of the bloody action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military force to pressure Mexicans.
The army launched a shot at demonstration activities that took place peacefully on the beach on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of left wing students planted its roots throughout the Latin American region.
Lopez Obrador has already provided support for young people in Mexico by providing monthly grants to those who are studying and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities motivated young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should have faked the A.I.
Because China is more active in making intelligence, the U.S. is supposed to represent the number of funds that will be used for research in that field, says the investor and practice A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has been working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. overall lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China recognized its plan last year: to become number one in the 2030 AI innovation.
"Regarding AI research funding is a good start, remembering that all other countries tend to stay far away from the United States, and we're looking for the next TV in the AI," Lee said.
Assuming the funds could illustrate the possibility that the next great AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he planned an AI system that beats the best Othello American player, and then he works as an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee admits the U.S. government technology competition earlier like the Robotics Challenge for the Mutakhir Defense Research Project and asks when the next action will be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win a gift from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes the lead of the academy; it's a company," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring individuals from the university for AI research for the last few years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to support the AI side effort.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PhD graduates in the field of AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its next Generation Wise Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Yays provides funds for people in academic institutions as well as the way the Chinese Science Yays and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the lower quality of academic work in China, says Lee.
Early this year at the U.S. Department of Defence developed the Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Building Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment worth $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
For NSF, DARPA recently invested over $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for it to be set up by the National Security Commission for Development has not seen any further action for months.
The Macedonians made a call in the order of the country's name
The Macedonians made a call on Sunday to decide on the change in the name of the country as "the Republic of North Macedonia," an action that will resolve the conflict for a decade with Greece that has endorsed its bid to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, defends the view that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents ownership recognition of its territory and has banned its association with NATO and the European Union.
Both sides reached agreement in June on the basis of a new name, but national opposition argued that the change would destroy the identity of most of Macedonia's ethnic people.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the public election and a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether the outcome could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the vote required to declare the election.
The question on the sound ball is, "Do you agree to NATO and the EU's membership by accepting a deal with Greece?"
Name change support, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that it is the price to be paid to obtain admission into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament say that they will obey the results of the vote.
The name change needs to be changed to two or three times in parliament.
The Country Election Commission says there is no infringement report until 1 p.m.
However, the result of the vote was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of the voters listed their letters.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an electorate in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice mail for the Macedonian public election in a series of changes to the country's name that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small stage and pulled the seats in front of tents made by those who are going to cheer up those voices.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join with honor, not through the servant door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a salary rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that most people will accept it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voicemail.
He said "yes" would be "confirm our future."
A follow - up opinion published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in that vote - less than the required number.
According to another opinion, held by the TV station Telma Macedonia, found 57 percent of the answers planned to be given on Sundays.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
To achieve that success, 50 percent need to be added to 1 voice.
A failure in the voice call will represent a first policy rejection against the pro-Barat government since it took place in May last year.
Witnessing: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City is exploring the entire Brighton defense to print a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were defeated as a defender of Brighton at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the University of Manchester, England.
Aguero made the victory seem very easy on his score in minutes to 65.
Argentina’s attackers received an opera in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran among the three Brighton defenders, before refusing to enter the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four greens.
He threw himself through one man's defense before running ahead of a few other men at the end of Brighton's castle.
Then he turned to his left, to Sterling.
The British front slide took advantage of its first tendency from the bow to operate the ball back to Aguero, who used its right foot to defeat Brighton's Cyprus, Matthew Ryan with a tendency to the right.
"Aguero fights with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola City Manager to the reporter.
"We've been talking about himself playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he printed a goal at that time."
But Sterling is the one who gave Sky Blues the first advantage in the Prime Minister's League fight.
That goal happened in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball, far away in Brighton's area at the game.
He was working on a ball with a long stretch of space that covered Leroy Sane’s left wing.
Sane did a little soccer before leading Sterling to the far-off position.
Sky Blue's front cross moves the ball to the right direction before the ball launches out of the border.

Scherzer wants to drive a spoiler against Rockies
By eliminating the Nationals from the playoff game, there's no more reason to force another match.
But Scherzer is too competitive hoping to be able to beat Colorado Rockies in a Sunday match, but only if there's still playoff implications for Rockies, which is supreme in one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies didn't get a place after winning a game of wild-cards against the Nationals with a score 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to win their first division.
"Although we play without winning, at least we can't know the weather in Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams who will compete at the highest level of any point I may be facing this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
Nationals haven't announced an open game for Sunday, but it's reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer join the game.
Scherzer, who will begin the song for 34 times, holds a training session on Thursday and begins a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.

Campaign trumps in West Virginia.
The president is particularly concerned about the situation of the Supreme Court's election judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the importance of the Republic's public voice in the middle of the election.
"Every effort we've made has been under attack in November.
Five weeks before making the most important choice in our life.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump continues, "You see there's a radical group of democrats that are very scary, you can see it happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see their crime, their crime.
They do not care who is injured. We do not give them what they desire.
Democrat, he said, is on mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, "democratics are called "sudden and evil and ugly and can't be trusted."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein, who served on the Senate Surgery Committee by calling his name, which was warmly welcomed by his listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Do you want to reload the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting for it--it's a very bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
Now it's intolerant to anyone who makes his mind appear.
When Momentum activists at my local party gave a voice to threaten me, it was not surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we made an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she firmly advocated antisemitism.
In my case, the threat was criticizing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of economic policy that is responsible, at national security, in Europe, the ironic issue is the same as that of Jeremy Corbyn as the previous leader.
The announcement for the meeting of East Nottingham workers on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, such a meeting of the General Committee on Friday night.
Unfortunately today, the quality of many meetings and promises about a "better, more friendly" policy has not been forgotten for a long time, if, indeed, it has ever begun.
The differences in opinion in the working party are becoming increasingly intolerable and each opinion is valued by the party’s authority.
It started right after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague I thought I would be able to share the same political view, and I started hoping to turn around and accept the position I would never have received before - both in national security and in the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly and don’t care what I say, then there’s going to be a poll in the media that asks for a stopover, a policy that is out of focus, telling me I shouldn’t be at the Labour Party.
And it wasn't just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues because of the comments addressed to me about political tendencies.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleague, who suffers from sexual harassment or racism every day, but never gets away with it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of today’s political era is the extent to which abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a wider church and with every mission "do not trust ourselves" or change party rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that moved me to keep down my head, didn't say too much, and then I would say, "Okay."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the 32-year-old Labour Party when I was still a school student, provoked by the persecution of the Thatcher government that resulted in my class of compulsive schools literally collapsed, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who very much need it - both as local council and minister in government.
I have never hidden my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham is going to question my political position and things I don't agree to in command right now.
For those who promote the mission on Friday, which I can say is when the country moves quickly towards the division of sovereignty, that would endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the Labour Party or not.

Ayar 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayar
The last two trials may have been a little over-done, but no doubt Ayr deserves to win the Tennant's Premiership which is very comforting today.
Now they're in the top order, the only unbeatable side of ten.
In the end, their superior defenses, and the ability to get the best chances, which made the home team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tried our game, and we're still not defeated, so we're happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose says, "Thanks to Ayr, they're better off taking the chance than we're doing."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but yellow cards for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, given at that game by Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to print numbers and Jason Baggot captured attempts that were not yet converted.
The climate extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of time, he printed the goal then made a single attempt to make Ayr's score 17-5 at a time of rest.
Melrose, however, made a good start in the second half, and the attempts by Patrick Anderson, who was modified by Baggot, reduced her chances to five points.
Then there was a long nerve because Ruarid Knott suffered serious injury, was arrested out, and since he was back in the game, Ayr went on more quickly than the Stafford McDowall's attempts, changed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a bidder with Bruce Colvine's unaltered attempt at the end of the pressure.
The housekeeper has returned to play, but, at the time the Hutchinson Straan got a yellow card because he was holding the airlock without a ball, from the watch lines, MacPherson got behind the injured Ayr.
The climate has been changed, as it has been, almost since the beginning of the match, after Kyle Rowe made a forced trend and disrupted the fifth effort by Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star is ready to pursue his new career in the restaurant industry.
The Styl Game Stars appeared to be ready to move their way to the service industry after it was previously known that he was installed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56 - year - old at a popular BBC event, was staged and also starred at by his former comedian partner, Greg Hemphil.
The couple have announced that the series of nine coming is the last episode, and it seems Kiernan plans to drive the broadcast right after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of the Aeroplane Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a Scottish Sun survey indicated that the Church was trying to get involved in "a growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
“ The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that justice will return to the Pacific.
Seafarer did patrols at the large launch camp located in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Marine Camp from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motorcycle: "The sea is our legitimate right.
To rise again is a duty."
Passing through Bolivia, surrounded by landslides, memories of the loss of a beach line in a 19th - century bloody conflict in Chile remain clear — like the desire to cross the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, because Bolivia is awaiting a court order on October 1, after a match for five years.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly a positive hope for its results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will witness ICJ trials across the country hope that the courts in The Hague will support Bolivia’s claim that - after a few decades of confrontation - Chile is obliged to lay down the assurance of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia's province, who is charismatic about the controversial war for the next year's election -- also has a lot of support for Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are certain that the court cannot decide whether Bolivia's will is going to change a little if it's possible.
The Netherlands, based on the United Nations, has no power to surrender the Chilean territory, and has established that it will not decide the outcome of the possible match.
That the ICJ decree came only six months after the last argument was heard, which indicated the case "not complex," said Paz Zárate, a member of Chile's international law.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may have been a return.
"The problem of access to the sea has been undermined by the Bolivian government now," he said.
The violent rhetoric of Morales has weakened the good faith of the remaining Chilean people, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will remain at a certain point, but it will be very difficult to remain discussed after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not been able to exchange large numbers of ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of the Bolivian government in The Hague, quickly rejected the idea of making decisions.
Monday will give Bolivia an "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict of opinion with the benefit of together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-is still one of the most famous Latin American presidents to use maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never let go of its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see what we need to do in the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons explosions won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never break nuclear weapons if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He referred to the United States as fulfilling the agreement made at the meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comment appeared when the Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pompeo appeared to begin a nuclear diplomacy that had erupted for more than three months after meeting Kim Jong One from North Korea.
Ri says only a "sweet dream" that by continuing to sanction and deny the U.S. declaration of the Korean War would make North Korea surrender.
Washington is on guard to accept that statement without Pyongyang making an effort to limit the armed forces first.
Okay, Kim and President A.S. Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
However, there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about admitting that the country's weapons warehouse is the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris Mode Shows a lot of recent collection closes to the main road near you
If you want to multiply the hat collection or really want to protect from sunlight don't look for other ones.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne issued a large-scale cover series for their SS19 collection at the stage of the fashion show with a fancy style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hats have wiped Instagram out this summer and these designers have been watching creations that delight the eyes on the stage.
The highlight of Valentino is a cream hat that is decorated on it with a wide back of hair that covers the head of the model.
Large accessory including a number of beautified diamonds, witches ’ hats and even a nose, but not made to recapture the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of weird and accurate hats to Halloween.
A lot of different colored hats his lips have been shaped and like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creature that resembles an inflated shell is equipped with snorkel and glass of eyes, while it looks like ice cream.
And if you keep going through that ad-mode collection - then you're being honest.
Mode watchers estimate that the large hat collection will be based on the main road near you.
The big hats became a very running train in the ‘La Bomba’, a metal hat with a two-legged width visible to all people including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The decoration of the label is reversed by a hat that is highly improbable by the social media making a large creation on the shorewalks of a large dam that is almost identical to the swimwear - used with a flat model.
The even rafia bag burned, cut off by the rafia on the side with a white leather grip rope, is a remarkable thing from the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
The hairdresser Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see a large hat and a beach bag arrive on the main road for the next summer - because the designer has made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the request for that big accessory."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are very important to the people of the world
Scotland’s private school kept track of the academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with remarkable tests, which were strengthened by each student and the collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Schools Council (SCIS), are working hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
Schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their career in choice, and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement school curriculums as expected, we have seen that modern language continues to be an eye - opener for popular choice learning and that it is desirable in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words will enter his head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your words will enter his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this recent test, we can see that the language is the top position of the league table with the highest degree in high school.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language get the A Plus value.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools that showed that 72 percent of students received the A Plus value in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also received the A value.
This shows that schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be needed by children and adolescents in the coming years.
Currently, languages, as a choice of learning, are held in the same standard as STEM's studies (scientific, technology, wealth and mathematics) in modern schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Department in 2014 found that for some reasons the employer had to keep fighting the problem, 17 percent of the reason was the lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly being promoted to prepare teenagers for their careers in time.
By increasing the number of opportunities to work in a language field, this ability is vital in a global world.
Whatever career choice a person has, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will experience real benefits because of having such a life - style.
You can communicate directly with people from a foreign country will automatically make a great multilingualist in competition.
According to YouTube's opinion of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to make French and speak the only language spoken in two percent, which is 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children now is an important thing for now.
Having multilingual skills, especially national languages with a growing economy, will give children a better chance to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the most important languages in English for a few years to come — 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen in high school, with the teaching staff of experts in this field.
The school's headquarters is intended to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and meet them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It can't be assumed that at this point, in the global business environment, language will always be an important part of determining the future of the country, so this has to be done in education.
In fact, modern language must be truly considered "international communication skills."
The school will continue to offer choices, beliefs, and excellence to the Scottish adolescents.
It's a good thing to do.

LeBron's going to start for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Expectant fans to see LeBron James start his debut for Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening of the Sunday season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it was not yet determined how many minutes he would play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After this early week’s training, James was asked about his plan for the six - game game in Lakers.
"In my current career stage, I don't have to do a pro-seasonal game to prepare," he said.
General Trump Plan in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a public awareness campaign tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public close of Trump's five public closes scheduled next week, including stopping in some fun places that cover Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was insisted that the voice call was postponed so that he could choose the meeting of the Supreme Court, Trump meant building support for him for a general half-time election due to the Republic's risk of losing control of Congress if the voice call was made in November.
What time is the general Trump in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
General Trump at Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the general Trump in West Virginia online via direct broadcasts on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s trial for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which is becoming more tense after the allegations of indecent sexual behavior and the Senate’s interpretation of the vote will be postponed until one week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this popular agenda is to help the Republican party to get some time in the November general election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign stated that five public closes this week aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters because the Republic party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and DPR," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is very important for his agenda so that the president may as much as possible move to the countries of the country during the busy campaign season," said Trump campaign leader who refused to mention his name to Reuters.
Designed for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the public is expected tonight to be able to provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract links from the Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who was left behind in the wake of an opinion.
"There's no good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to improve his opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. U.S. team bravely defended her hope in a single Sunday match
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday forum session is probably needed in this Ryder Cup.
The timing of the event is a concept of sports that is the result of a completely dependable encounter with players, and no one is more than this in competition.
According to them, where is the moment?
"Before, they're six points high and now four, so I think we're considering it a little bit moment," Jordan Spieth drowned over that day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of winning four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spyth says, felt they had a little moment and they had a lot of things that could get excited, except for the formation of Spyth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one boasted three out of four points.
Spieth has been deadlyly playing from tea area to green area and leading by example.
The celebration of the moon is becoming louder when it comes to its turn, making a striking blow to make a series of matches when he and Thomas lose two enemies.
The punching of him that beats them on the number 15 that's met with a similar scream, the scream that tells you that he's sure America won't lose.
"You really need to work harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes to be sealed.
The only player with points more than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unexplained story from Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who don't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That down, and how their energy seems to flow well to or from this vicious crowd that convinces them that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and there is no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari who will lock Europe's potential at sunset on Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time they're both put in a different hole.
However, it is too late to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson reduced Sergio Garcia's work, a fourball hero in the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine like digging holes that will never be planted by Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Although, on Sunday, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and forums are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategies can change at a time.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and leads quite far to the final day, but the forum session also shows that the U.S. team has the guts to compete despite doubt by some parties, especially in the United States.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit on the final day of Ryder Cup after getting up from the fourball game and Saturday's foursome by leading 10-6 over the United States.
Two inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two victories over Tiger Woods who have to fight record their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend a trophies that were not available in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American target team in the morning, made this series a 3-1.
The United States provided more combat in the forums, won two matches, but they could not reduce deficits.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from a 12-day single game on Sunday to defend the trophies.
Fleetwood was the first European champion to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were named "Molliwood" after the end of the sensational week, were just a second couple who won four points from their four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourballs, they became very strong to defeat Woods that jumped and the American debut of Bryson Dechambeau with more firm 5-4-4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, once appeared brilliant but he had lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in sequence.
Justin Rose, resting at the fourball in the morning, then returning to join Henrik Stenson in the forum and losing 2+1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - one and three worlds.
Europe did not reach it on its own, even though the day was fun and crowded on the west coast of Paris.
The main winner three times was Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas setting a two - point target for America on Saturday.
They won a 2+1 win on Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
It just happened twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from the four points deficit into a single game, though as a champion of the Fury team only needs a series of points to defend the trophies.
However, after becoming the second best of two days, the week - long attack seemed to be going on.
North Korea says 'impossible' will tear down the weapon on its own without any confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations about the ongoing sanctions in their distrust of the United States, and it could not have seized its nuclear weapons in some way in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's annual General Officer that North Korea has taken "significant steps showing good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear testing and missiles, launching nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no self-confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we could not destroy our own weapons in the first place."
While Ri repeats the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the "step" approach to the revelations where North Korea will be punished for taking steps, the significant statement is that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a statement jointly issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the US president's office and the North Korean leader this first held in Singapore on 12 June, at which time Kim promised to try "recovery of the Korean invasion" while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea has officially wanted the Korean War Wars 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected the call for international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "primarily cleared" and increases pressure by offering semi-permanent sanctions to their ends, and even rejects the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri's water.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel down is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that those sanctions will continue to undermine our trust."
Ri didn't mention the plan for a second summit between Kim and Trump led by the United States leaders in the United Nations this early week.
The minister even arranged three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in in the last five months, and added: "If the party concerned with this disclosure is South Korea and not the United States, it will not find a way out."
However, Ri's speech dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly that targeting North Korea rockets on the United States land is something that cannot be avoided after "Mr. President of the Devil" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in a meeting of the United Nations, Trump the year ago threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, immersing praise on Kim for his courage to take steps to break down, but the great work still needs to be done and sanctions must continue to be imposed until North Korea is reopened.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--it doesn't matter," he said.
Chiongkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and must not fail until we know that full, final and verifiable clearance."
The Peace Council has been raising sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop the supply of nuclear programmes and Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Council and then said that he was going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that there has actually been progress, only North Korea is in the hour that he's making "a gangster charge."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to blow up the missile sites and also the nuclear complex if the United States took "proper action."
He said that Kim told him to do "adequate action" with his wish was a security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard University took a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students sleep there more, in an effort to combat macho culture in a study that is developing through 'breathing birds' powering caffeine.
One academic found that students at the number one world university often know nothing if they discuss very basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep specialist medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, planning a course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a school about the effect of less sleep on his study.
'At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I just told now, in the year of my end?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping--which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course that was first launched this year, explained to students the essentials of how good sleep habit helps academics and athletes to improve their public welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were very low in sleep all week.
The course for one hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of a room, where students click on cup of coffee, dishes, sports shoes, and books to get an explanation about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results are influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleeptime routine.
On the other hand, participants are told how long a lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with an interactive icon, then moved the audience to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the student's behavior instinctively.
But we're sure that they have the right to know--as if you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke in health,' grew Prof.
A culture proud of the 'breath' still exists, its water, plus that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that means a lack of sleep is an ongoing problem.
Ensure you sleep enough, with good quality, you have to be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, its water--even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate mode of hunger, causes the feeling of continuing hunger.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old in California who studied chemistry and physics and who helped Professor Cheisler to plan the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the whole college.
The next step, he hopes that the entire school will be instructed to complete a similar program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Cheisler recommends that students consider arranging sleep time alarms, including wake-up alarms, and realize the effects of ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can drive the Circumstance rhythm out of its path so that it causes sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Bringing down the mind of Gerard's army
After all, Rangers felt the day's sadness when the Dolly attack was delivering Steven Gerrard's team that ended up in a 1-0 crash in Livingston.
Team Ibrox tried to record their first victory on their way, since winning 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his team to leave eight points of the Ladbrokes Premierity Hearts class leader.
By attacking seven minutes before the first round is over and Rangers who are out of their minds don't seem to be balanced.
While Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third position, just left a different goal from the Hibernian.
And there might be further problems in Rangers cave after Calum Spence linekeeper needs to be treated for head injury after an object has been thrown away from the distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that took Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took one point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with a costume that loves their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate ball ownership, but Livingston takes advantage of the ball they own better.
They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bet was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor, but the bat pulled the big opportunity too wide.
The Jacobs Keaghan Free Challenges that went back to meeting Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only penetrate wide into his back position.
Rangers take control, but there seems to be more hope than confidence about their game at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get a warrant when he and Steven Lawless were on a four-hour sign, but then Steven Thomson refused to compare the citizens of this Colombian country.
Rangers managed to do only two throws in the first pod but the previous Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, almost never got into trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and easy attack on Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposed to the race path, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep death tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted when he retired by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the replacement almost gave direct influence when the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played an amazingly fast out of the line to stand.
But Livingstone continues to force the landing team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett swallowing all the long balls.
Team Holt was supposed to extend their superiority to the final stage, but McGregor stood up well to get Jacobs out before Lithgow hid wide from the corner.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton, claimed to be a guard when he was arguing with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his face around again.
Almac: Geiger’s Discovery
And now from our Sunday Morning pages: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE'RE GOING TO BE AGAINST... on the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which was a discovery that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Reader.
As a scientific tool since then, Geiger's break-up has also become a pop culture fan, as in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado," amongst the cowboy scientists who seem to be less convinced by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's Breaker, used to find radioactive mineral sites, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effect released by radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans: "Tell me, it's coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery kept her name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' evil cells
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' evil cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of medicine
The method involves the process of extracting the immune cell from the patient, transforming it into a laboratory
They can then "know" the common protein on many cancers and then resuscitate
A test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the evil cell, her ovary cancer was lost for more than 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, transforming it into a laboratory so that they can "know" the proteins that are commonly available in many cancers called HER2, and then resuscitating that cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Foundation in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "It's a fact that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives some kinds of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and teaching them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started Diatribe Pro-Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL performance.
Not a Good Walk
Kanye West was held at the studio during Saturday Night Live after showing off where he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said he was going to win himself over in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, Ghost Town's name where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic Party and repeated his support for Trump.
"I often spoke to white people and they said, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the show with a thunderstorm star named Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the West's tapes were uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock's trying to make a joke about the West with that review.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble at the back of the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They covered me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They're covering for me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West continues: "Do you want to see the dark place?" says he's going to wear Superman's clothes, because this means you can't tell what to do.
Try to love."
His comment produced at least twice of the viewers and SNL performances seemed to be embarrassing, Variety reported, with one person saying, "The whole studio is silent."
West was taken in the last few moments as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, a former rap singer Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
The West confuses many with the look of the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the conservative leader of TPUA, Candace Turner, who wrote the tweet: "To one of the bravest souls: TO TAKE LOVE FROM THE FOOD."
But the director of Karen Hunter's show wrote a tweet that West just "becomes herself and it's really very good."
"But I choose not to offer someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") that I believe is used and defeating dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "an officially known creature as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's lead, he's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Along with rap singer, Snoop Dogg gets the name Snoop Lion and certainly builds Prince's music legend, turns his name into a symbol and then an artist who was previously known as Prince.
Demand for attempted assassination at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was arrested at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened at Ballyhackamore, police say.
The judge was expected to appear before the National Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor.
Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizing poison masculinity
Harington's kit is famous for wielding a sword in its role as Jon Snow in the middle-century fantasy series full of violence from HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, surpassed the stereotype of the macho hero, he said that the role on such screens made teenagers often feel that they should be strong to respect.
Talk to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he's sure there's something wrong and asks how to deal with the bad masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his opponent at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt "strong enough" in discussing the issue.
'I feel personally, strong enough, right now--where is our fault in this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculinity with its very masculinity.
He continued: 'What is the character from birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions of this time - how do we change it?
Because there's clearly something wrong with young people.'
In that interview he also admitted that he would not play in the pre-uel or church Game of Thrones when this series would end in the summer coming, saying that he had 'completed with the field of war and horses'.
Since November Kit will tell him true West back from Sam Shepard, a story about the filmmaker and his brothers, who was a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life begins' his words.
Rose played Ygritte, a character-loving flower called Jon Snow, in the fantasy series of this award-winning Emmy.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Insect reports 14% of new cases
Tiongkok has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are displaced in this country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were brought up through sex, marking changes from the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through several parts of Tiongkok as a result of the transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people living with HIV in this way has decreased to nearly zero, the Tiongkok Health Office said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Tiongkok increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT Tiongkok community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tiongkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was increasingly called an issue.
Because of this country's conservative value, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many sexually transmitted diseases are derived from improper sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Tiongkok government has promised universal access to HIV as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters objected that the staff had disbanded the data of the GOP senator, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
The U.S. Attorney Maxine Waters on Saturday objected that one of his staff has sent personal information to the three United States Party senators to the Wikipedia page of the parliamentary members.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party stressed that the claim was motivated by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
"False, lie, and many more gross lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that written information included home address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
That information appeared online on Thursday, sent by unknown persons in the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel assembly on charges of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
It was not long after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as the Pondit Gateway and RedState report that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment is linked to the Waters office and discloses information from one of the staff members of the Waters, Hill reports.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is really wrong and is an absolute lie," adds Waters.
"Members of my staff -- who identity, personal information, and his safety are threatened by false and false accusations -- are not at all responsible for the leaking of this information.
This is not a valid accusation, and it is a lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew the net criticism, including from former White House Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This difference means anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be Congressman.
If someone were to accuse them of something they did not do, they would not be angry.
They can't go away.
They must not question the defendant’s motives.
They will be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of criticizing him too much during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republic's party that is trying to appeal to Waters at half the time, also expresses her thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," it was written on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authorities and law enforcement entities about this wrong charge.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrator is exposed," he added, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for one of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - A poor Atkinson sightseeing parody
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with the usual English view has become a tradition and it seems to be happening to reappear to Johnny English song parody -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would the sarcasm be a hint of how bad it is that we are becoming a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, Johnny English, who looks pale, square-faced, and uncompetent, has updated his license to ruin everything for the second time - his name gives guidance more than anything that he is a broad comic creation designed for a cinema area other than English.
Of course he was a crazy secret agent who, out of his strange suspicions, had a little Clouseau character, according to Mr. Bean's character and a group of passengers who contributed little notes to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony in London 2012.
Indeed, he is truly the base of a visitor and an international mystery man who has ever been played by Atkinson on the Barclaycard TV commercial that is now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on the most recent JJ journey.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter by wearing half a century's purple robe and rotating the rotor with the speed of swinging in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt less powerful and too strange, especially when the "serious" movie like 007 and Mission Nei believed itself to insert comedy as a material.
It felt like it was intended for kids from adults, and for me, it's a variety of weird, uninvited Johnny English condolences and the focus of Atkinson's movies in Bean's personality.
The premier who's been hot for years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber journalist has entered the British super-secret spy web network, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to disappoint the agent - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who has destroyed his total political popularity: Emma Thompson plays a very good role with almost-Teresa-May character but not much that can be replaced by his writings.
His wise counselor gives information that because every active spy has been weakened, he must bring someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, now employed as head of school in some fancy buildings, but gave a secret lesson about how to perform the funeral: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a Academy of Spectators like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency instructions and once again united with old friends who had suffered from Bough for a long time, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, broadcasts a commander of the submarine, a top-class woman's role as an asshole where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit disfellowshipped.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake at the High Secret Agent, took action again, met the beautiful mystery woman Ophelia Bullettova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister worried about falling into the influence of millions of charismatic technologies that claim to solve English computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their ridiculous adventures: hiding as a servant, they burned down a fast-burning restaurant in France; they made trouble by sneaking onto the noble boat owned by Volta; and English sparked anarchy when he tried to use the virtual reality headset to secure himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops must have been attracted to the last sequence, but with such bias and suspicion, there's a few TV channels of children that are full of everything.
That's quite a modest thing.
And just like the other Johnny English movie, I can't think of it: couldn't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was really suitable for his talent?
Work is planning a plan for British citizens to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the United States of America considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week but was paid five days.
The association was reported to want the company’s owners to continue their labor - intensive work through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them additional holidays.
He will allow the workers to enjoy the weekend of three days but will continue to receive the same reward.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and the article moved the country to support the workers.
Changes to four days a week have been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, the senior of the Labour Union, told The Sunday Times: 'A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen last night, but four days' work in a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy that supports the workers and industry strategy parties as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, because the Green Party has promised four days of work in a week on the public election campaign in 2017.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The jury said: 'The working day in a week is not party politics and is not being considered by the party.'
The Chancellor of Shadow John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to complete his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell says he's determined to regain power from the 'anonymous director' and the 'prisoners' in the utility company.
This shadow chancellor's article also means, today's stockholder in a drinking water company may not get his entire stock back because the government of the Labour Party is able to do 'retirement' with a sense of violation.
He also made sure that his plan was to place employees in the company hall and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, who would raise annual dividends to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his own appeal at the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether this Bureau's finding could affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In the interview presented on Sunday, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked the Senator of the Republican Party.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his partner in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I had already spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, and the charge came up, and he said, 'Have you done it?'
He's a strong, determined, firm man."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice could not be altered.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and needs a bigger claim to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is that Brett strongly objected to it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he calls his name can't verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does Global Citizen Festival mean, and has this event done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York, will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music show that shows a spectacular display of stars and also an effective mission; end poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will be witness to tens of thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy action by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of this event, namely to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international lawyers hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for that event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), a concert visitor must complete a set of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has this 12 - year - old Global Citizen been in achieving its goal?
Do you think giving a gift like a free concert is the right way to invite people to take action, or just another case called "clicctivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, motivating them to set other goals.
It has been said that this action has helped the world's leaders to announce commitments and policies of more than $37 billion that will affect more than $2.25 billion in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of which has been issued or made a fund-raising.
This group estimates that security funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments, among other things, The Power of Nutrition, which are based in England made up of investors and performers committed to "help children grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end the shortage of GIs in that country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the sponsor, the national government, and the Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustices about this lack of teeth a record in history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would generate 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the questions on the Public Question on their website that asked you "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen said, "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just as civil rights movements and the great anti-apartheid that have existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars that appear on this year's New York event, which will be held by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy as a "block" to slow down the export of Russian energy - Secretary in the country
"If necessary," Washington could ask the Navy to help prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary Ryan Zinke, as reported by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believes that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where it operates on legitimate government invitations, is a way to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure their reason for being in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just as they do in Eastern Europe, south of Europe," he reported.
And according to the branch office, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure the open seaway, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the actors on the show held by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a nirlaba group that called itself "the voice of energy customers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of efficiency, they're the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are less, take advantage of and replace fuel," he said, claiming Russia as one of the "members in the field" with a economy that relies on fossil fuels.
This statement occurred when Trump's government prosecutors were conducting a series of missions to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
For this, Trump government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, were trying to lure Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 "indecent" oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 oil factory, worth $11 billion, designed to represent the oil pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's hard fight against this project was just driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be created to make pressure and that customers must be able to choose their own format," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the US not to interfere with European energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a great problem if a third country blends our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "Expert the Situation" when recommending himself as president in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said.
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "determine the situation" when he promoted himself as president after the mid-term election.
When campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider recommending himself.
"After the time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our brazen rule, including putting a woman in the top," as he said to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to look into the situation when I'm recommending myself as president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when campaigning at the city hall, saying that he "carried this area in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's bluffing in his criticism of Trump and the Chief Justice of the Brett Kavanaugh Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a voice call."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s constitutions did not want him to promote himself in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probability" election in Massachusetts said the senator didn't recommend himself, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent support those efforts.
That opinion showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick for self - promotion, with 38 percent who supported the possibility of self - promotion and 48 percent who opposed it.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that are discussed about the possibility of becoming successful in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he'll officially decide on it in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin wrote PTSD Track Palin on Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent one year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence in his home on Saturday night
"What my son experienced, what he's going to experience when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries that our military suffers," he said in front of the audience who were present at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "the power in the room" and related about his son and other war veterans, "they returned with a little different, they returned more hard, they returned and asked if there was respect for what they had given, together with the soldiers and the planes and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen countries and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that rejects thirst for refugees from gangs or domestic violence.
The prosecutors from 18 countries and districts called on friends of the-the-court letter on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers against that policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of Grace v. In a session session called American Civil Liberties Union in August for federal politics has not been revealed.
He said to his partner "and his son, who was a cruel gang member," he had hurt him, but the U.S. officials refused his request on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s country trial describes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which has produced a huge number of gamblers for the United States, as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. security policy is lagging behind the 2014 Immigration Council decision allowing dark immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to appeal for asylum.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "respecting the laws of the state, the federal, and the international that have been in place for several decades."
"Federal law requires that all claims must be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to the claim, and such a prohibition violates principles," his letter friend-of-the-court said.
Further prosecution gave a brief opinion that policies that refused to enter the US economy would damage the economy, said that they were likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary work force."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge to stop giving victims of violence in the home and gang violence.
"It is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to racial, religious, national, or social group issues, or certain political opinions," the sessions said in this policy announcement on 11 June.
It's not meant to alleviate all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue effort in Palu because the victim doubles in time to find a safe victim
For those who survive, the situation is getting worse.
"It was a very bitter feeling," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who calmed her baby who was seeking refuge in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes bringing the body.
The clean water is very rare."
People look back to their ruined home, take the stuff that's in the water, try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated in the hospital, the damage caused by a 7,5 - magnitude earthquake.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered from bone and shoulder fractures, lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of a severe convulsions.
His eyes flow as he recounts his feelings when the earthquake hits the five-bedroom hotel room where he lives with his wife and daughter.
"It's impossible to save yourself.
I think I'm trapped by the collapse of a wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry, please, and then shut up.
I didn’t know what was going on with my son and me.
Let them live."
U.S. Attorney-General accused Tiongkok of 'intimacy' with 'propaganda commercial'
A week after Tiongkok's official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on an American day that called the profits of the US-Tiongkok trade back, US ambassadors to Tiongkok accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States last Wednesday referred to the Chinese Daily Supplement to the Des Moines Register - reported newspaper in the state of Iowa - after claiming that Tiongkok tried to interfere with the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6th, a charge filed by Tiongkok.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, which marks what the U.S. office told Reuters, is a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to press Tiongkok.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, which has led them to increase the import tariffs of each other.
The Tiongkok revenge rate at the beginning of this war was designed to arrest exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republic, says Tiongkok and the United States.
Terry Branstad, U.S.A.'s envoy for Tiongkok and former Governor-in-Office of Iowa, export major farm goods to Tiongkok, says Beijing has damaged workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tuongkok, Branstad wrote an opinion at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now simulates the intimidation by running advertising on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Tiongkok government took advantage of the tradition of freedom of speech and of press freedom that was highly appreciated in America by loading paid advertisements at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the street newspaper kiosks here, in Beijing, you will find a restriction on different voices and will not see the real mirror of the different opinions that may have been held by Tiongkok people about the difficult economic transition of Tiongkok, since the media is under control of the Tiongkok Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tiongkok refused offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
A Warning Analysis, Republican Party Defends Women’s Elections Through the Kavanaugh Disaster
Because the reputation of the important people in the Republican Party stands and defends the leadership of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a back attack, especially from women, at the general half-hour election.
Emotions about this problem are very high, and most members of the Republican Party have shown that they want to move on to voice calls.
That cannot be denied," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the Senator's motivation (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's minutes of the end to do FBI investigation would be enough to slow down the anger of the electorate.
"Woman will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior counselor and national jury for the Progressive MoveOn group, said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators yelled "November is near!" when they performed a demonstration at the Senate Hall when the Republican Party controlled the Judicial Committee to continue progressing in Kavanaugh's campaign dropped from the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will emerge from the list," political analyst Stu Rothenberg said to the news site.
"People say it's quite high; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voice speakers in the areas of youth and youth, 18 to 29 years old, who, because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before Ford’s public witness, which explained in detail sexual harassment against him by the governing body of the Supreme Court, the analysis suggests that there would be a reverse attack if the Republican Party continued to force him to go ahead with confirmation.
"This became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Party Committee of the Republic, early last week, to NBC News.
"This isn't just about choosing a committee or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the stand, it's also about how the Republic Party deals with this problem and how they deal with it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose a Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans would seem to be divided about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favorable choice to the last.
A new follow-up by YouTube shows that 41 percent of respondents really believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's move, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath in front of the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh, who was in a drunken state, attacked him at the age of 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court's chaplain showed him his boldness when they attended a party while they were at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Founder for Starting a New Web to Meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a World Wide Web author, launched a startup that seeks to capture Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the Berners-Lee, Solid source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the meaning behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the start.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create "personal online storage" or their own POD.
These stores may include contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional devices.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that really depends on who can access what kind of information.
In the company is known as "personal intelligence through data."
The idea to establish Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is that the company has the resources, processes, and skills that are useful to help Solid be available to everyone.
Now this company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some staff developers who are opposed to working projects, and the code-maker volunteer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralization applications use the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all their business models would really be reversed last night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and a commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the neutrality of the network debate.

Bernard Water: warning WW1 lama Victoria Cross
The only pope of the Church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, was reminded of his birth on earth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann, won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attack in Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a jitu shooter and never knew that he had won England’s highest military honor.
A warning stone was erected by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "silence symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of grandfather's achievement won appreciation.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "tow very dense dust under the firefighting rate of field and machine guns."
Then he hurried forward to the time line and with "the greatest courage" led the front line before he rushed using the weapon of the field alone and dropped three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German jitu shooter on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I can't live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a flower shop after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very fond of being part of this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans spent the night watching Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you have spent the night watching Bellator 206 full of stuff just to refuse to watch the main event.
The San Jose report contains 13 matches, including six on the main card and is being presented directly throughout the night in English at Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald are getting ready to face each other, viewers in England are being beaten when their legs turn into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated when they gather to this special day for the fight.
A Twitter fan described switching to children's cartoons as a "stupid joke."
"This is the rule of the government, that at 6 p.m. the content is not appropriate to be presented, so that it is replaced by the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of the installation and communication Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Daddy's dad," yeah."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they'd fix their schedule by counting the audience in England in time to come.
"Instruct me, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it," said Coker.
"But now there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday's time, Monday's time.
But we are doing our best.
Trust me, at the time of the change, there's a lot of backwards text and everything isn't education.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, that will never happen again.
We're going to reduce only five fights from six fights -- as we usually do -- and we're going to try to avoid too many performances for fans, and we're going to make it.
"This is a state of infamy."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'weak' about sexuality
Olympiade Tom Daley said he grew up with a low self-esteem because of his sexuality -- but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about the right of gays to give hope to others.
He also said that being a parent made him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual performers brought this long walk, Kirsty Young, taking a few months off because of the illness.
Looks like the ones who got disfellowshipped from Laverne's first program, Daley says he feels "less than" everyone else who grew up with him because "you don't have something socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said, “To this day, my feelings are different from those of other people, and I have been given strength and power.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they knew about his sexuality.
The two medals of the Olympics have become the famous LGBT campaign leader and used his appearance at Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries so as not to discriminate against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The world's champion three times said he fell in love with a filmmaker from the Dustin Lance Black U.S. that he met in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married Oscar, who was 20 years older than he was last year, and he said that aging is not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age"--he followed his first Olympics at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later--he says it's very hard to find someone with the same age who has the same letter pair.
This couple has become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "the whole perspective" has changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all like 'I should win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning the gold medal Olympics.
The gold medal of my Olympics is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got a ticket for the 2012 Olympics -- because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit on the front row of your father'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, at last I admit that he wasn't defeated," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the race.
"What I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life--to drown in front of a crowd at the Olympics, there's no feeling better than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - that has already joined him in his preparation for the Olympics and still makes him cry.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mikkelson changed his role when proposed to Ryder Cup on Saturday
The U.S.P. Phil Mickelson will record the day of the week when he played Ryder Cup's 47th, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played the two-year event to record the 12th record, was proposed by Captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four groups on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually did for the United States, the main winner of this five-time splits his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that stage, with hope to fix what's bothering him.
Never become the most direct golfer at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not fit to follow a very tight course at Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and harsh sentences for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Mikkelson, in a nine-day game on Sunday, to face the very accurate British champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new comer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer starts 12 single matches with four points below, starts with a hot start, then the Mikkelson match is proven to be very important.
Furyk expressed his confidence in this man, not because he could say a lot of other things.
"He really understands his role today, kicks my back and hugs me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
She's the Hall of Famer and she gave so much to this team last year, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the rest of them, but that's how they play, and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another environment, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the best-played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that will never match his individual record height.
Mikkelson won 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven series, although Furyk said that his presence brought some things that could not be said to the team.
"He's funny, he's tough, he's a criminal, he likes people to laugh, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explains.
"I thought the younger player was having fun with her, too, this week, which was quite fun to see.
He gives a lot, more than just playing."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great greatness can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, learned from experience that someone who led quite large towards his last match at Ryder Cup could easily become an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, with the captain of the Seve Ballesteros team holding five points high over America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the smallest margin, winning 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a great deal of power in Valderrama; we get a great deal of power in Brooklyn, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but just recently," said Bjorn, taking the picture, after viewing the Class of 2018, won 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will enter the game that is really boring.
Get out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get points on the writing board.
We have a target, and the target is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying for a long time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also very aware of what is on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
It's nice to see players playing in a hard golf course, Bjorn adds, "In this thing I'll never make my own progress.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual player will move, and this is a different thing to do.
It's nice to be out there with a partner if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested completely.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will ask him to play better individually than they did as a couple, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furik himself has been on the two end of the final day of that great game, has been part of the team that won in Brooklyn before the end of the defeat when Europe did the "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember all those words," she said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it fast as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it'll give you a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a playlist and put people in different ways that we think, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players on the top line.
"I went with a group of these people in a row like this because I think I can close all the way," said Bjorn about his only choice.
The new German warship is delayed.
The German Navy's newest watchship was due to begin its mission in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but it won't be there until at least next year because of the wrong system and its rising cost, the local media reported.
The commission of "Reinland-Pfalz", the new Baden-Wuerttemberg main guard ship, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which commissioned a military spokesman.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the shipping crisis had disrupted this ambitious project’s success.
The fourth Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship that was sent to the Marine Force in 2007 will come as a replacement for the old Bremen class.
This ship will be equipped with strong minerals, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some wireless technologies, such as radar removal, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important features, including longer periods of treatment, were to be allowed to use the latest guardship for two years away from its original port.
However, the delay of this lofty warship - which is said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad - will cease at the beginning of its task, The Time recorded.
A bad F125 watchman had been declared last year, when the German Navy officially refused to charge the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss bay in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the ship’s shipyard after the shipment.
Only a few well-known reasons behind the return of the ship, however, the German media has quoted a number of "soft equipment and hard equipment" that makes the warship useless if used for the battle mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by the crew of 120 sailors - only half of the work force on the older Bremen class.
It is also known that the ship’s boats are far too large to reduce its power supply and limit the ability of the Navy to add to the changes in time to come.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bobot is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the broken hardware, the cost of production of the entire project — including the training of your ship — became a problem.
It's said to be surprisingly up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) -- up from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem with this recent guard ship became very important to keep in mind the latest warning because of the collapse of the German navy forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Marine Army actually "has disappeared with extensive capacity."
The officer says it's getting bigger all the time, because old ships are no longer in use, but there's no replacement ships available.
He regrets that not one of the Baden-Wuerttemberg guards could join the Marine Army.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Squad
A new piece of literature was produced in a village in the Highlands of Scotland, where the aim was to discover how the eagles used natural resources in their food hunts.
It is expected that this meeting will provide new light on this unique flying mammalian behavior and will help to guide conservation activities in time to come.
This study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the popular and soprano pipistrelles and long-range chocolate velvet and Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
The special anchors will be placed in the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also perform cellular monitoring using a stem detector.
A voice expert who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of the call and the species doing what activity.
Then the map and the habitat report will be made to make a detailed outline of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes this result will reveal which habitat is most important to the bat and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as the production of pastures and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
A vast population in Scotland and throughout England has fallen sharply in the last few centuries.
This rider is threatened by a construction and development work that affects the interior and disappears.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as a tight paper that is tied to traps and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from maintenance cats.
It's not really a blind man.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using high-gem location techniques to find insects correctly and prevent them from flying.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land across the country, is deeply concerned about the ravages.
They have ten trained personnel, who regularly do surveys, internal checks, and sometimes try to save.
This organization has also established the first and only natural search in Scotland in the Thrave countryside in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager says it's the right area for the bats.
"Here at Thrave, we have a good area for the bat," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about stars, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to grow."
He stressed the importance of checking bats before doing maintenance in the property, because without realizing it's possible that a single copy could kill up to 400 female bats and still a small one, which might destroy the entire local population.
To protect and kill, to injure, or to disturb, or to destroy, a leper is an illegal act.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s branch for the Conservation of Trust Watches, has moved the public to come and help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species that we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo, who rejected the claim of rape, is preparing a lawyer for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls himself a claim of rape as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyer will demand German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the complaint.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus were accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then expected to pay him by giving $375.000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram live broadcast video to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, threatening the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Prosecutor Ronaldo is preparing to claim Der Spiegel on the charges, which they call "a suspicious report in the field of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer says he's going to ask for compensation as "a substitute for moral corruption in an appropriate number of ways, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the playwright's room, where he was supposed to have raped him, according to a report reported by the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after the incident that occurred and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who disappointed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo allowed them both to have sex, but it was based on desire together.
Mayorga also said she went to the police's office and had made a visa for her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to settle the case outside the court because she felt "fear would get revenge" and worried that "would be publicly humiliated."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's still suffering trauma from that caused incident.
Ronaldo almost joined the Royal Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant club Italia Juve with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: English "will regret forever" over the loss of car makers
British "will regret forever" if he loses his status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "on Toyota," England has told the BBC that if England leaves the European Union without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The original Japanese car manufacturer said the effects of border enforcement if there was no agreement would damage Brexit in the cost of work.
The factory in Burnston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"I think it's if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see a production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed their concern about leaving the European Union without any agreement on how the border trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's gonna shut down the mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what car manufacturers say is the risk of a chain of trade if there is no agreement with Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on the basis of the "precise time" production principle, with the root tribes entering every 37 minutes of English and European Union cookers for cars made according to orders.
If Britain came out of the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there might be a disturbance on the border, which, according to industry, could lead to overcrowding and a lack of stockpiles.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's supply at his factory in Derbyshire, the company's attorney says, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark says the Chequers Theresa May plan to connect with the European Union in the future is "calibrated properly to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal, but we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success right now, but to get this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 program.
"It's not just from Toyota, but also from other producers, that we really need to be able to continue what's already been a very good marketing chain."
Toyota can't tell how long production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warns that the cost add-on will reduce the competitive capacity of the factory and ultimately damage the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Workers' Association at the factory, said more and more concerns: "As far as my experience is concerned, so this job is gone, it will never return.
The jury said, "We have put forward the right and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein is probably gonna be delayed back, White Building rain.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with the chief prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "deposited again a week" because of the battle of the chief court-martial Brett Kavanaugh still continuing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special advisory work of Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference of Russia in the public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential that the president has to prevent justice.
Whether Trump would fire a high-ranking prosecutor or not, who would endanger Mueller's freedom, has been calling in Washington for months.
Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and possibly simplifying the president through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein objected to the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of a report that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the U.S. office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose for no" fired Rosenstein, but that meeting was postponed again to avoid interference with the Senate Judicial Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had charged him with sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for one week on a claim against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's vote.
Press secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
He was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "For that meeting not yet scheduled, it could be this week, I could see that he was returning it to the next good week also remembered his other things that happened in the grand court.
But we only see and I always want to bring the latest news to the press."
Some reporters will object: Sanders has not been holding a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
The driver of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders says it's rare that meetings aren't because they don't like TV reporters "who try to attract attention," though, he says, "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president's doing more questions directly than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting is still going to happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask a question to the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried more often and you've seen a lot of us doing this in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or a press conference with a visiting high official.
The solo press conference rarely happened.
This week in New York City, the president may show his reasons, make his appearance free and sometimes strange before the press gather.
Health Secretary wrote a letter to European workers at the NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working in the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to Britain withdrawing from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has committed itself to paying the regular salary of the status quo for citizens of the European Union who work in the public service transferred.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between England and the European Union on this retreat continue to draw closer to what is expected of this autumn.
However, the British government has also been ready for the possibility that there will be no agreement.
I know this must be really bothering you all.
That is why I now want to emphasize again how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of the staff, who has left their nation.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, have gained valuable experience and skills that strengthen and increase health care, and benefit the patients and society we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Coping With Emergency Operations After Coping With Headache
Backdrop Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having suffered head injury at 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Coach Head of Tennessee State, Rod Reed told the injured reporter that it happened not long before the hatchet was over.
"He came to the back of the field and fell to pieces there," said Reed.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by the trainer and medical staff on the back of the field before putting it in the barn and taking it to further evaluation.
An officer from Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "there are no details about the type/level of injuries that have been experienced" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the students of these two red oak levels, was in her first spring with the Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five tickets on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made his total tickets this summer into 18 tickets.
Foreigners will be charged higher material costs if they buy property in England
Foreigners will be charged higher material costs when they buy property in England, as well as additional money that will be used to help the homeless according to the new Tory
This step will hold Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The cost of this material will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in England
The Department of Finance estimates that it will collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreigners will be clothed with a higher salary when they buy property in England — along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to keep Jeremy Corbyn from making a success of his efforts in attracting young voters with the promise that he will provide a more secure and secure home.
Increased material costs will be borne to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that stimulates the government’s efforts to combat fraud.
The additional cost of the present material cost, including the higher level identified two years ago at the second house purchase and the rental of the house, can be estimated to be three percent.
The Finance Department expects this move to go up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the property newly built in London was purchased by the non-English people, causing price rises and makes it more difficult for the first buyer to put his feet on the roof.
Many rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital -- have become "the ghost city" because many foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a piece of material money to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining the price of property by buying land but not using it, and forced Mrs. May to ignore the quota for houses that had been built to repair the "housewives" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of reforms in the area of attractive housing, including renting and ending the "without guilt".
He also wanted to give greater power to the hall to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's office to restore the British dream -- that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our messy house market.
English will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in Britain, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy a comfortable home for those who are working hard.
For many there is a dream to have a house which is far away, and the conduct of the people is inconvenient.
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the team of Scotland'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "the main ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland on a few steps.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, is enjoying the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East Club, which currently sits on the third level in the One League, with three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last summer.
"I want to beat my country as a player.
I get a B hat and that's her," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watch Scotland's team in Hampden with my father as a kid, and it always becomes something that attracts me to come back.
But it'll be a chance, if I succeed in the team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross among others Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he didn't feel afraid to follow the big name marks at that whole club after he refused the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the achievement of this moment will be measured with 'May I return this club to the League of Premiers?'
Because the structure and facilities in this club are no longer suspected of being in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't make it easy to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful man here, if I could bring this club back there."
Ross' career in team management was only three years, after some time as a boss assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a training staff in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to the third position, and turn St. Mirren from the decline as the winner of the championship in the next season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be the crossroads I have to go through," remembers when taking over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds really weird because I'm fine, making a decent living, and enjoying some good things.
But playing can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to spend every week.
I'm still suffering from work pressure, but in managing it feels good.
I always want to lead something and now I do it, I feel the most comfortable I've ever felt in my adult life."

Survey found, the right time to drink beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has increased public income in England that is struggling to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
Figures show that audiences and bars saw increases in sales of 2.7 percent in July, but income at restaurants fell to 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who arranged these numbers, said: "The British sun shining and participating in the World Cup that is longer than expected, July will follow the same pattern as the month of June before, where public income increases by 2.8 per cent, except for a restaurant that gets a strong breath.
It's down to 1.8 percent of the restaurant's trade in June is going to get worse in July.
The sales of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far appear to be the strongest than what happened at the down restaurant.
The public who sells food also suffers from the heat of the sun, although it does not separate the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just go out for a drink.
Sales across the pub and the bar that sells drinks up to 6.6 percent for this month, selling down three percent."
Paul Newman, an analysis of the recreation and hotel RSM says: "This has continued the train we've seen since April.
The weather and the effects of social events or major sports continue to be the biggest factor in domestic sales.
No wonder that a group of restaurants continues to fight to survive, although sales of 4.8 percent a year from year to year will be severely affected by the current cost pressure.
The long hot season should not come at the time when the food vendors are going through bad times, and the time will tell you what good temperature we've enjoyed in August will give you a little rest.
Total sales growth across the public and restaurants, including those recently opened, is 2.7 percent in July, showing the trail on the launch of the brand.
The company's sales of Coffer Peach Tracker for the public sector, the bar, and the restaurants in England collect and analyze the kinery data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion, and is a waste of the size of the industry that can no longer be recovered.
One of the five children has a secret social media account they hid from their parents
Survey revealed, one of the five children -- some of them are 11 years old -- have a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers
Surveying 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "False Insta" site
This report has increased the anxiety about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to show parents
One of the five children among them is 11 years of age — making social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
Surveying 20,000 high school students revealed the massive development of "False Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo sharing site in Instagram.
That report has increased her anxiety about postponing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate a "main" account that has been cleared to show parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager asking others to " rape me."
The research done by the British Digital Intelligence and the Men's School Head Conference and the Women's School Head (HMC) of Independent Schools found 40 percent of students 11 to 18 years of age have two profiles, with half of them admit to keeping a personal account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says, "This is disturbing so many young children that they try to create an online space that their parents and teachers cannot find."
Second Doyle will be "a voice for athletes" in the Scottish Athletics
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Chamber as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's cross-country athlete and field that was most honored and the leader of Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those leading the field of sports to benefit from his many experiences at international level for the past few decades.
"Eilid is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the hall," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
American athletes, who won the 200 - foot - long [200 m] race and 400 - foot [400 m] Olympics in 1996 in Atlanta between the total four gold medals of their Olympics and now become this BBC expert, are now unable to walk after an ischemic attack in a moment.
He wrote on Twitter: "This month I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor says only the time that can determine if I can restore it and to what degree it is restored.
It is as if working hard to recover completely, to learn again how to walk, and to do task training today!
Thank you for sending me a hearty message."
A breast pump advertisement that compares mother to cow has divided opinions in the online world
The breast - pumping company has shared views in the online world with an ad that compares the mother to the cow being fertilized.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be "a breast pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," the consumer technology company Elvie commissioned an ad inspired by criminal music videos to show the freedom given this new pump to express a mother.
Four mothers dance in the hills with a cow and follow a song that shows the lyrics like this: "Yes, I shine myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this is not the only one, it's my breast."
It goes on with the refrain: "The pump is out, the pump is out, I feed them love, the pump is out, the pump is out, I spray my woman's milk."
However, advertisements published on this company’s Facebook page have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a wide range of reactions from antlers, with many who say it makes the dairy industry "growth."
"A very bad decision to use cattle to advertise this product.
Like us, cows should also be pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies were stolen from them within a few days after they were born," someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is very suitable in BiH (Elvie/Mobu)
Another comment: "A trauma that can be understood well for mother and baby.
But why don't you use it to advertise breast pumps for the mother who has to take care of her baby?"
And there are others who say, "This is a lost cause."
Someone else's defending the ad, with a woman admitting that she found that song "lucky."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still in trouble.
Emerasing makes me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I'll take it if it's there.
It's a brilliant product," someone wrote.
And there are others who say: This is an entertainment unto the mothers of those who strive (for Allah's cause) and who feel as though they were cows.
It's not advertising that praises or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with the hidden pumps inside their bra.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the care of many women who beat the ASI who said they felt like cows.
However, Elvie Pump was really hungry, without cable or tub and passport in the bra intertwined, which gave women freedom to move, hugging their babies, and even going out as they peeped.
Ana Balarin, a teammate and ECD in Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is a product that deserves to be launched with conviction and provocative.
By comparing the image between expressing women and cows, we want to pump ASI and all its challenges, and we show it through how to enjoy and enjoy the full freedom enjoyed by the new pump.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump has become the main news.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on a row for designer Martha Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silenced to the Tent of Meeting in Texas’s Border
The number of children detained is increasing, although the monthly border crossings remain unchanged, partly due to the harsh statements and policies identified by the Trump government, which are difficult to adopt by sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and fear that their own ability to stay in that country would be compromised by moving ahead to save their children.
The risk is increasing in June, when the federal government announces that the sponsors and other adult members of the house must hand over their fingerprints, and their data will be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration officer and Bea Cukai, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for child sponsorship under the age of the country.
The bank then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested didn't have a history of criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who became sponsors or members of the sponsorship group are in this country illegally, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting these people," said Mr. Albence.
Aiming to process children faster, the officers introduced new rules that required some of them to be present in court within one month of being arrested, not after 60 days, which had become a previous standard, speaking to the shelter workers.
Most of them showed up by calling a video conference, not directly, to apply for their legal status to immigration judges.
Those whom we consider not worthy of receiving help are directly deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become more anxious or depressed, so as a result of increased violence or trying to escape, the workers speak shelter and system reports that have been accepted in the last few months.
Lawyers say that anxiety is increasing in larger facilities such as Tornillo, which marks a child struggling tends to be ignored, because of its size.
They said that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally or say good-bye to their friends can spoil a lot of trauma.
Syria asks the US, France and Turkey to return immediately
Pedato in the United Nations General Majelis, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked the Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as the prime minister's representative, said that foreign troops were residing in Syria illegally, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with in full."
"They must return quickly and without making any demands," he said to the writer.
Moualem stressed that "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He insisted that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from the terrorist group and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially trained and influenced the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war - torn region.
With regard to refugees' problems, Moualem insisted that they should return immediately, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "an extraordinary fear" that prompted refugees to get further away.
"We have asked the international community and the organization of humanity to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a whole human problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the political agreement between the Assad and the opposition ended the war.
U.S. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish the buffer zone in the great temple of the last rebel Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack from the Russian-supported army in the province, where there are three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty had "a clear period of time" and gave rise to the hope that military action would target the monks, including fighters from the Nusra Front who were associated with Al-Qaeda, who were "to be washed."
US envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly call the first meeting of the new committee consisting of the government and members of the opposition to make the war-fighting law for Syria and open the way to the general election.
Moualem put the Syrian government's requirements in committee, insisting that the panel work should be limited "to review the latest legal trades," and warns against hand-cuffing.
Why Trump Will Win Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 except because many hopeful liberal spectators, accusations and scandals will end his presidency here.
No one doubtes, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there's no sign of fatigue for viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's main hour rate has risen more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million main watch, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, says Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has sat at the top of the cable TV rate with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the main news.
"This is a spirit that makes people interested in something that is not understood yet," said Neal Baer, who led the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," about cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Facts Going Into Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembered taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give his voice to Trump.
Why? He asked.
"She said, 'cause she made me laugh,' Mrs. Scovell said to me.
The value of entertainment is a mess.
Surely, unlike other TV events, the events that appear from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigration family can reunite and restore the global economy.
On the other hand, a wealth that can only be felt by the most special viewers.
By the way, not only did you become a known citizen of the country at six o'clock when you found yourself watching the panel of experts debate the use of "the background" sources Bob Woodward for his book called "fair," wearing a bird's skin bomber jacket worth $15,000 ("hard clothing with pride," Revelation The Washington Post) and the implications of the terrible description of Stormy Daniels on Trump anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"Part of the policy he's doing makes it just like a real show that cheers you up every night," Brent Montgomery, executive head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars," about the show scene and the history of Trump's daily story (chosen by NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it felt like 80 degrees out of his house on the north coast of you, but he was hiding when watching MSNBC and filming CNN.
He was unable to release himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and then the Supreme Court according to its balance.
"I remember when we held all the crazy shows on that day and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," "Mr. Fleiss told me.

Lots of money from outside ravaged the shortest half-time election competition in the White House
On the contrary, Pennsylvania 17 received a flood of money, the blessings of the return visits to the convention district, which provided two prisoners in the same seat.
The Pittsburg District recently re-established, called Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrats - who won seats in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb's progress against another defender, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the 12th - century Pennsylvania district, which is facing the new 17th Pennsylvania district.
These maps were restored after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the side of the Republic party.
Competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in a large number of campaign funds between the major party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The lambs became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in the Maret special election, which was held in general for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been inhabited by the Republican Party office for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump wins the district with 20 points.
Politicians have sent the Democratic Party a little higher.
The U.S. Balanced El Salvador's punishment for supporting the Tigcock, and then retreated.
The diplomats made sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama had admitted to Beijing, giving little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until the team expelled the Trump Organisation Management Team.
Foreign Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of the US diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Naurut, a spokesperson for the Department, issued an early statement this month.
However, punishment is only considered for El Salvador, who received some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, construction support, and economic support.
Sentenced sentences, which cover the payment of financial assistance and visa restrictions, will harm the Central American country and increase its rates of unemployment and murder.
When an internal meeting took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to attend the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials insisted that they want a conference to be continued, so that they can effectively end their consideration of El Salvador's sentences.
Deputy President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at that conference, this time scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government's import on that neighborhood, the expressions of diplomats.
And the third American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new counsel or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by the third American office, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consideration of this unclear situation.
Their statements were strengthened by an external analysis close to the government and by speaking about this uncertain situation.
Study Edition
The other surprising story is a special advisor's report by Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr. Trump's custody warrants, which currently have very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses whether Trump's campaign is collaborating with Russia in our public elections.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be asked to take responsibility from him, right when he is ready to go back to the electorate, and perhaps eventually become a jury of his peers.
Therefore, there is still much to be done, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's rule cannot be avoided or united in Europe.
There are choices that we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to make a stand against Hitler, if the West were to oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that follow.
The beginning of history is centered at the point of such migration, and the speed or delay of democracy cannot be avoided.
Today, the United States faces some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fired the Chief Justice of the Rosenstein Rod, the one who watched over the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and felt that he was not worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account is not true.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that has just been requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is referred to the Supreme Court even if there is a strong charge of sexual assault and false testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress that's going to demand Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who had once built my great army.
He survived, then migrated to America, and, 60 years later, he asked me to light up the Sabbath oil on a desk that wrote a handwriting.
By leaving that legacy to me, how did I lose my hope for our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feel optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers ate Rapid Vienna on Thursday, won victory over Austria, followed by good odds in Spain against Villarreal this early month, will strengthen their position to get away from the G League of Europe Group.
The knee injury made Graham Dorrans in the middle can't show up this first season until the result of 2-2 against Villareal, but he's sure Rangers can take advantage of it as a stone to the greatest despair.
"This point is very good for us because Villareal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go by raising one point.
In the end, we may be able to do so, but we believe that the results of our efforts may be just.
In the first chapter, they may have looked better, but in the second, we got up and became a better team.
Visiting Thursday, tonight becomes another European big day.
We hope we can score three points even though it will be a difficult match because they have good results in their last match, but with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because of my injuries and changes in that club itself, but now there's a very good hope in this club.
It's a good squad and kids really enjoy it. It's a good training.
May we now be able to grow, put the past behind us and succeed."

Although it turns out that the surveyor has a vague idea of how they want to be cared for, there are not many people who discuss it with their family.
About half of the people in the nationwide study discuss long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of them say they're discussing this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start that discussion," said Holly Snyder, president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won't be able to prepare your own family to provide care if you don't tell your wishes first.
Talk with your family counselors, where and how you get treatment, because your choice will mean very important in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor will certainly be able to help you in showing you how to pay those costs.
The services you choose for long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or make sure yourself with your wealth-- as long as you have money.
Show your legal document: In the face of legal disputes.
Show immediate power to your health care, someone you believe to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professional people when you cannot communicate.
On the other hand, the letter of authority in your financial affairs should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to handle all your financial decisions you have to choose, except to make sure you pay your bill if you can't.
Always remember with every little detail: Imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer a number of questions about medication or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man shot a gun at Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a windgun on his way home from a party at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several times shot at his chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting was described by the officer as happening around 2:30 BST, and was said to be "accidental."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses have been reported by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis so horrificly hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, destroyed just a few 384 lives, reported officials, and estimated to increase the number of deaths.
It was decided that the communication would bring the officers who provided the aid with difficulty to get information from the Dongala Province, an area on the north side of the city of Palu that is closer to the stormy center with the power of 7.5 Richter scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of major facts about the cities of Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of the lake on the west coast of the Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
By then, it was more than 200 miles [300 km] from the shoreline on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This province, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 persons in 2017.
Andlan's economic eyes in the southern province of Sulawesi are looking for fish and land, especially on the Dongala coast.
However, the presence of nickel was also important in this province, even though most were located in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
Written in the last 100 years, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Board.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of homes in the eastern part of the country.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in West Dongala.
In seismic terms, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Cincin and therefore the earthquake will occur in an orderly manner.
A large number of earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are as follows:
The year 2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a great earthquake, right on the west coast of the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, until it destroyed 226,000 lives along the Indian Seashore, and more than half the victims were killed in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, a violent earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
In 2006, an earthquake of 6.8 hit the south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis on the south coast and resulting in nearly 700 deaths.
2009: We were hit by a 7.6 - magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: One of the islands on the island of Mantawai, in the wake of Sumatra, was struck with a violent 7,5 - magnitude earthquake, causing tsunamis some 30 feet (10 m) long when it hit tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The Pide Jaya, Aceh, also suffered from an earthquake and caused the destruction, as well as the horrors of people who remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although this time there was no tsunami potential, more than 100 people died because of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, named after the tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake caused thousands of buildings to be destroyed, while thousands of tourists were thrown into it.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, former governor Alaska and the candidate president's representative, have been arrested with a warrant of assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, prevented domestic violence reports, and opposed arrest efforts, as reported by the Alaska National Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, she picked up the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Mat-su Preparadlan Prison, with $500 indemnified, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network was reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, saying he was "innocent, confident" when asked about his help.
Palin faced three minor Class A violations, which could have resulted in one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with charge of Class B, with one day's sentence and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, this isn't the first time the charge of treason.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the attack.
The case is now referred to the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was called upon to stand up to domestic violence, to prevent reports of domestic violence, and to hold firearms in drunken state, which were also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of showing off his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was threatened by the rebel vet group linking her son's violence with PTSD as a result of her work in Iraq.
Tsunami and Earthquakes in Indonesia: Hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was hit by a terrible earthquake that killed at least 384 victims.
The 7.5 Richter scale earthquake that could trigger tsunamis has forced thousands of homes to be destroyed.
The electricity and communication networks are broken down, and the number of deaths is expected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake then hit Sulawesi in the middle, located east of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital.
Videos that show how awful the moments of the disaster are going through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in Palu at the time, when tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors are trying to get a death sentence that rarely happens to suspect a terrorist attack at NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York tried to get a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the sentence is rare and has never been done in the federally related crime country since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was expected to take an attack by breaking the truck he was hired from Home Depot on foot and riding a bicycle on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to allow this death sentence, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "by deliberate" killed those eight victims and "by deliberate" caused serious body damage, based on a statement of intention to drop the death sentence, which was sent to the South New York District.
On the basis of a legal document, the two charges provided for the execution of the sentence of death.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice seized Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in order to investigate the harassment, which was usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and charges of violence and attempts to destroy the motor vehicle.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early mutilation," as a picture of Saipov's crime done with "sudden, cruel, and foolish."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were Argentina's original tourists.
Counted one decade since South New York District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, charged with the murder of two drug addicts, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death sentence last time in the New York federal court in 1953, was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were found guilty of spy conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple were killed by a power station.
On the basis of a legal document, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any regret that the day and month after the attack had taken place.
When asked by the investigator, he said that he was pleased with what he had done, the police spoke up.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that the attack he did was inspired by the ISIS video that was watched from his phone, as the claim was.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police water.
He stated that he was innocent of 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "clearly disappointed" about the prosecutor's decision.
"According to us, the decision to execute death rather than receive a plea for life imprisonment without a guarantee of release will only extend the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, the Saipov defense team had asked the prosecutor not to drop the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit's negotiations, Tory MP says.
Nigel Farage called for 'encouragement of the people' today in protest action at Tory's conference.
The former leader of the party said that politicians should "taste its heat" Eurosceptics - because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that they join in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Group Support Peter Bone told the action road in Birmingham that England 'should be out' right now if Farage only served as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge facing May in reconciling his position has been undermined by the support of Remain Tories, who are involved in separate protests that threatened Brexit in that city.
Prime Minister fought to defend the Chequers compromise plan to remain on track despite the mid-attacks of Brexitiers, Remainers and the European Union.
The member states stressed that they would be moved to reach agreement with Brussels, even if they had a negative response - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide the choice between their own package and 'disquieting'.
Bone told the Mass Leave Meaning Leave in Solihull that he wanted to remove the Chequers.
The result is that Farage must point out to his partner to be given responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If his responsibility remains him, we'll be out now," he said.
Members of the Wellingborough Parliament said, "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to remove the Chequers."
He said, as he pointed out his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight in the world's war to be subdued.
We want to lay down our own laws in our own country.'
Bone suggests that public opinion has been potential for changes since the 2016 call call: "The slogan that says that the British people's thinking has changed and wanted a permanent condition, it's not true at all."
Tory Brexiteeer Andrea Jenkins, who was also involved in the mass action, posted to the reporters: 'Just, I want to say, Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, while the opposition will not choose them, because they are not popular with our parties and our activists who really went down the road and made us selected in the first position.
Our request, remove the Chequers and start listening to us.'
And by a message sent to May, He said: "The Minister will keep their duty when they have fulfilled their promise."
Farage said that political demonstrations should be reversed in order to 'taste its heat' if they want to disobey the 2016 referendum decision.
'Now the most valuable thing is faith between us -- our people and our political people,' he said.
They said, "We are not going to let you go."
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political party, who is ready to disobey Brexit, also feel its heat.
"We are moving the soldiers of this country, who will conquer us in Brexit, and will never surrender to the British King, who stands and rules himself, and boasts."
Meanwhile, the remains mass moved through Birmingham before calling for action in the city center for two hours.
The active line appears to be spreading the Tories Against Brexit splendour after starting its line at the end of this week.
Fellows in the line of work, Lord Adonis, joked about the Conservative group's security issue when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can control the IT system and all the technologies for Canada, whatever, by anti-trafficking borders, in an unlimited range of free trades in Ireland," it grew.
‘ What a show.
At least there's no good Brexit,' it grew.
Warren plans to do "serious breakdown" in the president's poll
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to "break up the presidential election" after the election moment in November.
Boston Globe announces that the Massachusetts Democratic Party announces its future at the city hall in Massachusetts West on Saturday.
Warren, who often threatened President Donald Trump, recommended re-election in November against the GOP prosecutor Geoff Diehl, head of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already flagged as a Trump opponent in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke is the 36th with the electors, who have been known as the city's race format since Trump took place.
One participant asked him a question, whether there was a plan to recommend itself as president.
Warren also answered, that this is the right time for "the women to enter the circle of Washington to restore our corrupt government, and that includes the women sitting on top."
Got caught by Sims shooters, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced that he was arrested by a gunman's suspect until the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dieteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. at the ET press conference.
They watch the video on Friday, where a man identified asks for help as seen in the footage.
In the morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head and died at last," police chief Murphy J. Paul's blow to the media on Saturday, through 247 sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson fired a shot at him.
At the time of the interview, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of things, holding firearms, and shooting him toward Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any means of combat and imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with a height of 6 feet 6 inches, grew in Baton Rouge, that's Sims, who played in 32 matches with 10 early in the summer and on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 score in each match.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship after the team acknowledged his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear at the time of the Bottas Valteri being in front of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying position on Saturday that will carry the command of the Mercedes team to play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he defended his position in the first two laps and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel became the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the pressure at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very determined.
Mercedes walked in one lap after that and went out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued on after some follow-up actions that showed the driver's access to the Ferrari left the part in empty with the risk of surviving the double move to survive on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started starting at the back of the grid and was in the seventh position at the end of the first sheet at his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held up a tire replacement to target the quick resolution and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth.
He finally got into the pit on the 44th lap but couldn't raise his step on the eight remaining laps because Raikkonen finally took fourth position.
It was a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me.
Team has done a great job to have one two," said Hamilton.
That's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein in a rally on Saturday through his village, he did not invoke a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual violence against Judge Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a newspaper in West Virginia, the president did not directly make a statement made by Ford in front of the Senate Transitional Committee, but rather commented on what was happening in the Senate that showed people who were "bad and dishonest and dishonest."
"Something can happen and beautiful things are happening for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and mean and rude and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the cracks and cracks and then they said, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you dump her?
Remember the answer... did you open the document - "Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't throw it away."
Okay, wait a minute.
No, we didn't throw it," he added, as a senator.
Feinstein had sent a letter denouncing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it had been dropped earlier in September — but Feinstein said that it did not come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't break the story," Feinstein said to the committee, said Hill.
"He asked me to hide it and I kept it as secret as his request."
But the opposition seems to be unaccepted by the president, who commented during the Sunday night rally: "I'll tell you, it's a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
He continued his defense against the High Judge, who was charged with sexual harassment against three women, and the president was impressed to see that the Democrats used charges for their own sake.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see the crime, the kindness, they don't care who they're sick, who they have to walk to get power and surveillance," mediaite reports on the president's statement.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the face of Dundee
Dundee Stars won a defeat on Friday at the Elite League when he fought Belfast Giants by winning a match with a score of 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant won two goals earlier after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home a balance before Dwyer returned the giants.
Francois Bouchard compared the position to Dundee before two goals Lucas Lundvald Nielsen won their victory.
That's the loss of the Elite League this third season that was experienced by Adam Keefe's men, who managed to track down the retreat and finally beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It's a fourth meeting this summer between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous match.

During the dark opening period, Sullivan brought the housekeeper back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the gift giver for the balance that Cownie made at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants was supreme at the time of the first ever when he left the second night's goal at the end of the first period.
The housekeepers returned and Bouchard once again balanced their position with the goal of power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give priority to Dundee for the first time at the end of the match in the second period and he made sure to win with his team in mid-fifth during the final period.
Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five matches, are at stake to face Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
The Air Force then left to secure hundreds of passengers on a safe plane from the earthquake
A driver passing by in Indonesia's airstrip was kicked out as a hero after his death when he made sure a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
The strong meltdown continues to rock the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But in memory of his companions fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Antonius the Great refused to leave his post in a tower of hardy drivers at the Sis Al Jufri Mutiara Airport, Palu.
He chose to stand by to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air Force was then on the scene, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the driver's tower and jumped when he felt the tower began to fall.
He died after he was in the hospital.
Dr. Jones Sirat, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s Air Navigation Management Agency, presented his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balykchy in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost our bat this morning before the helicopter reached the Pale.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worried that the victims would die could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Body had given access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"Sacrifice will continue to increase because of many still vulnerable victims' bodies and many others that cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The wave that reached six meters has made Palu steep that causes a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water became rare.
Minimarkets everywhere are killed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the duties related to evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Niugini Water reported one missing after the plane crash
The air force operated a plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia and reported one person disappeared, after being previously reported to 47 passengers and crews were evacuated safely from the submerged aircraft.
Water Niugini reported on a weekly issue of Saturday’s issue that the authorities were unable to identify a man.
The authorities say the authorities have worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The authorities do not quickly respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers along with other crews, after the plane landed while trying to land in Chuuk Island.
The officials announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The authorities reported six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the order of events still remained unclear.
The authorities and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a well around the scene.
Some eyewitnesses feel overcrowded.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came down very low.
"That's really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him and the others that they were able to cross the river across the emergency door on that sinking plane.
He told the passengers that he was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a little headache in his head.
The U.S. Navy says that fishermen working close to the wells repaired also help rescues use boats to transport people to land before sinking into the depths about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate 111 people have died the world in an accident of registered PNGs for the last two decades but none of them have involved Water Niugini.
Analysis releases live-burning women's time line
The charge of arresting what happened on Saturday in the re-examination of a man accused of burning alive against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Analysis by the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as a witness to intelligence analysts.
He made a big line for the jury about how he used cell phone records to collect all kinds of moves against the 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis and 19 - year - old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis to be in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, in contrast to the previously charged statement, reported Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said, "I lied, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other inconsistency that Tellis presented was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they're getting to know each other within a week.
Rowlett reported that after the death of Chambers, sometimes Telllis deleted messages, calls and contact the Chambers information from his phone.
"He removed the victims from his life," said Hale.
It's scheduled to begin the closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped that the trial would lead to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of three hip hops want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who comes from Bristol, claims hip hop movements are far from the origin of political messages and tackle social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hip spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently seen a resurrection in the UK through some artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
NY's lover requires a couple to attack after issuing a "racialist" message
A New York lover demanded a couple because he had been discriminated against after receiving an indirect message from a complain mother and declared that he was "other black people."
The couple refused to believe that they were racist, and they considered it more like "response."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her concern when she realized that the new care provider, Giselle Maurice, was the black skin when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There's no one else alive," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending her to her husband, she actually sent her to Miss Maurice, twice.
Once she realized her mistake, the "unprecedented" Plasco-Faxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that they had taken out a lover, who was an African-American citizen, because he had done a bad job and he was more expecting the Philippines, based on New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then returned to Uber.
Now, Maurice requires the couple to make compensation for the cancellation, and asks for compensation for about $350 a day for a period of six months, as a substitute for the nursing work that she had to work at first, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," she said to the Post on Sunday, and then added, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple opposed the claims that they were racist, said that Maurice's fired workers were a legitimate thing to do, they worried they couldn't trust him after he was offended,
"My wife sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to the Post Office.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been hard on, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
It's like it's packed with "response," says Plasco's wife just gave birth to her baby for two months and was in "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone in such a condition?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment bank added.
In the course of the legal case, public opinion polls have made rapid threats to the couple in the social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington's worried readers won't be involved with the bear talking, the new newspaper revealed.
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after her book was accepted, explained in a letter: "It's hard to just talk without knowing what position she's in, read it for the first time before it was published.
It's so funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
To say his father, who was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired by writing a child's book with bear toys, who was very optimistic about the work he had refused, he added another year of publication that the 60th book was called "sweet plague" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "very important members of our family," he added his father quite proudly with the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet man, and he's not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a son who's got something: you're proud of them though not all your efforts.
I think he sees the success of Paddington like that.
Although it was the result of creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is in a state of death and I have to say goodbye to her by phone.
By the time he landed, his daughter was quickly taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to rescue him.
"He made a call quietly to say it was very bad. That he was very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received a call from Nad saying that he would die in two minutes' time and he asked me to say good-bye to him.
And so did I.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors have been given to keep her heart beating slowly and leave her system.
He's died a few times while the handling process is going on and everything's dead.
I could just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't scream, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at this point in mourning the loss of her daughter, on board a plane with other passengers - unaware of what she's been through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head fell on the floor, and my eyes still rubbed all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but when I was flying, I felt so much sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
Women who are mourning post cards to prevent themselves from killing themselves on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones tried to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers that can be contacted to get support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, aged 13 when he began to suffer depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They're always saying that his smile is spreading the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm still worried if there's going to be a shock."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone out there you can close and talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, not long after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was in the softest spot when Christmas--when the kids opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to go through it.
That separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was uncertain when the FBI started its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking -- an investigation that's limited time, limited coverage -- we could probably bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the "breakdown" committee in the middle of the council's decision-making.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their access to everything is due to time.
Legislative elections last five weeks, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republic did badly, they would become very weak in their ability to make the people they wanted to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, beating them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him to meet his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats will sit.
Still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the president's representative, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean numerals under Kim
The number of people who fled from North Korea to South Korea has dropped drastically since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, a member of the Democratic Republic of Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, postage data from the southern unit's funeral data, said there were 1,127 rounds last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says the border control between North Korea and Tiongkok and the higher tariffs that people are being charged with is the key factor.
Pyongyang didn't give a public comment.
Most North Koreans were eventually offered citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the refugees fled through Tiongkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier across than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
The cowardly treatment of the fugitives as illegal immigrants from refugees often forced them to return.
The relationship between the North and the South — technically still in war — has increased greatly in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, second-country leaders met in Pyongyang for a discussion that focused on late-declaration negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed widely to work together on a nuclear-free Korean landing.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of development since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no self-confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons on our side," said Mr. Ri in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of "hisisterism," she said she did not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of opposition Nancy Pelosi accused the Supreme Court of being a "histrisist" and said he did not suit the temperament to serve in the Supreme Court.
Peloi made that comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid thinking that if a Chinese woman did that, they would say 'histories'," Pelosio said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Chamber Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally challenged the claim that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and difficulty talking when discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also brutally condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying the charge against him was "a murder of an unreasonable and coordinated character" organised by the liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's witness to prove that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was just against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
The polio objected if he tried to claim that he had been approved, and if the Democrats had more voice in the People's Court.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court of his place now," said Pelosio.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Peloi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision on the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was regarded as a member of conservative justice.
In the post office congregation, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical and ordinary person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'
And the woman needs to handle it.
That's ethical dissatisfaction, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry: Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem strange to me, what do you think?"
And he said, "I am greatly helped by a woman who is executive in a place that says that she also wept when she was angry, but she developed a technique that means that she was angry and began to cry, and she will say to the one who was talking to her, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The water was poured out as a way out of some anger because it was basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of early jobs, in a man-dominated office, one time when I cried with unexpressed anger, was my throat struck by a woman who was older - a cold manager who was always a little scared - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a convention member of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in an out-of-marriage dispute on a boat named Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, was very frustrated, he realized that there was no reason for himself not to recommend himself as president.
"That's not a mature decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow and Seven Curtains."
Because it's too late in the campaign, he's left behind in a fund-raiser, so he swears he won't follow the election unless he's able to collect $2 million.
That's the fight that ends on the loss.
He found that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to the man only gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" she asked.
When he announces that he will not launch a formal campaign, he is overpowered by emotion - thank you to those who support him, frustration with a system that makes the withdrawal of funds so difficult and to target the electorate from the delegation, and anger against sexualism - it makes him difficult to talk.
"You may think I'm too nervous," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacts to him.
"You'll think that Kleinex is my sponsorship.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my desk?
"She's crying?"
How the US-Tiongkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of a trade match between the United States and Tiongkok was so disarmed, and while the fight was still far from the text, the gap between the two countries might only benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning this early year by treating taxes on Tiongkok's export key items including solar panels, sheets and aluminum.
A significant increase started this week with a new tariff that affected the value of $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all the stuff that entered the United States through Tiongkok.
Beijing's been refunding every time, recently charged five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
Chiongkok has applied to match the United States alone, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
Going back to Washington means following the will, but publicly defeating the U.S. will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, US competition can positively support Tiongkok in the long term by reducing the inter-economic dependency.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can make economic movement in both countries more dangerous than what has been noted before," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said that they were ready for voluntary return and offered help to rebuild a land that had been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the U.S. General Majelis, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the field is more stable and secure, the blessings of progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to rehabilitate areas that have been demolished by terrorists to restore them again.
All conditions are now present because they return voluntarily to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and a comprehensive economic decision that makes their lives a day and their sense of accomplishment as a target.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people in Syria have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others who still live in that country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe ensures the victory of the Ryder Ball in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Piala with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has never won the Ryder Pial in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its rank when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who has been working almost all the time on the tournaments, hits his tea on the water at the pool three doors of the 16th century, confessing his failure to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf athlete Molinari shines throughout the round, becoming 1 of 4 players who have been getting 5-0-0 since the format of the tournament started in 1979.
The American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5&4 by the weakest ranking player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 on Ian Poulter from England who probably only played in his last Ryder Pial.
A veteran eight Piala Ryder, Sergio Garcia of Spain, became a European with an overall victory of 25.5 points in this tournament.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold it today.
This is a tough year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy. I'm so glad you got the piano back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," said Garcia emotionally after winning Europe.
He gave his responsibility to his fellow citizen John Ram who won the legendary US Tiger Woods 2+1 golfer in a single game on Sunday.
"Wonderful pride that feels, defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost in his fourth match in France and now has a record 13-21-3 career record of Pial Ryder.
Strange statistics by one of the best players all the time, have won 14 main titles only under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to get a fairway with Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the cinema disappointed his team, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There's a time this morning when we're trying Europe.
We're fighting.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The whole 12 players played very well.
We're gonna sort it out again, I'm gonna work with PGA of America and our Ryder Pial Committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to give the honor.
We are defeated."
