How long have these marks been going on?
And every book should be treated like this, especially when you're your age
And burn with it.
And you have to check your cholesterol and blood.
And are you hot now?
And now that you've got this book?
And it's hard for you to breathe.
And what else do you have to tell me?
And how much does your heat rise?
And I'm close.
And I'm a little close.
And I'm really sorry today.
And the stars will be set in motion.
And it could hurt.
And I think I have a little light.
And I want you to know where your mouth is going.
And there's some of them burning.
And with the history of your diabetes
And you know, it looks like the book's going to collapse.
And you know, people are always standing in front of me.
And your mouth hurts.
And you're saying it's a pressure on your mouth
Family heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Have you noticed any other signs or problems with Peshitta's scar?
Are there other sick people at home with the same symptoms as you do?
Do you have any other mark?
Are you having a good time?
Do you still have any problems?
Because it's the flu weather.
But the problem of heart disease should not be ignored
But the more important it is now, the more it is.
But I'm a little sick of breathing.
But I know a lot of people are fighting in front of me.
But we have to treat each breast's pain very seriously.
But is there any problem with your breathing right now?
I forgot about this book.
Someone's pushing you like that.
Are you still breathing?
Are they accused of being sick with the same symptoms?
Do you have any other long - term disease like high blood pressure or something?
Do you have a long - term disease like any other disease or diabetes?
Do you have any breaths with that book?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have any trouble with him?
Do you know what that sign was?
Can you see this picture?
Drink a lot of salt today
Although I've tested diabetes.
But she's just as noticeable as I am.
How much is your heat?
How is your blood count?
If you have too much heat or less
If you have two percent or more of it.
If you think you need to improve your grades or problems
Last night, I was hot.
I'm a little hot, too.
Last night, I was hot.
I've got a terrible thing here in the book.
I'm sick of breathing.
I'll send you a picture.
I've had a little bit of trouble today.
Today I'm a little upset and a little hot.
I think it's a flu.
I think it's a light flu.
Is it not true that someone with more weight is sitting on your chest?
It all started with a headache, and it started to burn at almost the same time.
It hits right in the middle of my mouth
It's a pain in the ass.
It's in my mouth.
It's in the middle of my chest.
It's in the middle of a book.
I'm sick of it.
I'm so worried about this book.
You tell me what's wrong with your book.
High blood pressure or diabetes
Like in the middle of a book
Now you can take a Tacipirina suite for the heat
All right, Mary, how long are these marks for you?
Now you said you had a problem with your mouth.
Sometimes it hurts a little.
You have no other mark but that's what you're talking about.
Or is someone sitting on your chest?
Almost the same type of heat and cough, headaches, and headaches
In the middle of my book.
Show me in this picture where you're in trouble.
Because you're hot.
Do you think, then, that some of these symptoms may be associated with pregnancy?
Do your children have similar traits?
Tell me about the pain in your mouth
The heat's rising at night.
I've been hot for the past two days.
Last night the fire started to rise.
I'm the emergency doctor's porter of Traize Center.
Well, can you tell me a little bit more about the pain in your mouth?
Yeah, it's a mess in my chest in front of the body.
Look, there's a terrible thing in my mouth.
But when I'm sick,
What kind of pain does your mouth feel?
When did the book’s pain begin?
Where's your book?
Where do you feel this pain?
It looks like you've got some pressure on your chest.
You know I have diabetes.
You said you had a problem with this book.
From 1 January to 15 March 2020, the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom have rapidly increased the incidence of COVID-19.
The events of Cornaviras disease (COVID-19) show the same enthusiasm between the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, which ensures that while the country depends on the country, the COVID-19 continues to move rapidly across all the continents.
Based on knowledge from Italy, patients with diseases in COVID-19 who need health care and especially need careful care to increase their country, hospital and intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the Chinese Hubei reported an outbreak of a disease-related phenomenon in the city of Uhan in the province of Uhan.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Disease Control and Prevention Centre reported that Nivel Kornaviras is now referred to as the most serious flavor syndrome of Kornaviras 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as an active component.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 seizure called the disease Kornaviras disease (COVID-19).
To date, the standard data is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, with or without pneumonia, and most of them are infected.
Among 14% of the diseases, COVID-19 is becoming more serious than the hospital needs to be filled, while 6% of the patients suffer from severe diseases that require intensive care.
Because of COVID-19, the death rate of patients entering the hospital is about 4%.
In this review, we are reviewing each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and United Kingdom (UK) developments in COVID-19 and comparing them with China.
In addition, we compare the number of Italy between January 31st to March 15th 2020 with the current number of COVID-19 diseases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom.
EU/EEA country and UK COVID-19 events
China's Westerners are more geographically expanding COVID-19 and are now following the country's high-speed COVID-19 in the rest of the world.
The World Health Organization (WHO) Director General announced COVID-19 as excessive on 11 March 2020.
In the 5th of March 2020, Spiteri and his associates reported on the certified COVID-19 cases in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed injuries were reported by the French authorities on 24 January 2020 by Hubei Hubei in China.
By 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) had seized COVID-19, where 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported from 31 December 2019, where only 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths occurred in Italy.
COVID-19 serial numbers and serialized ratios
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only the health ministers of countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO report on the worldwide incidence of COVID-19 infections, which are updated every morning at 8:00 a.m.
This information was used to compare the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom with what happened in Italy.
As a proponent of the event of active COVID-19, we calculated the short-lived events of 14 days of COVID-19, thus considering the natural progress of COVID-19 during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom.
We also presented the number of cases documented in each country by 8 p.m. on 15 March 2020 and compared it with the Italian case of the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
EU/EEA Country and United Kingdom COVID-19 Inventories
In EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, the 14-day COVID-19 short-crowded events followed the country's (China) trend (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the successive events of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21st and then rapidly increased around February 28th 2020.
This was mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown a similar increase in the rate of increase in COVID-19.
The figures for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 were compared with the number of events of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It should be noted that by March 15 at 8:00 p.m., the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have already reported on Italy's comparable injuries only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known diseases in COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
COVID-19 shows that the waves are moving at comparable speeds in all countries.
Although countries are at different levels, there are differences in national public response, and there may be different definitions of diseases and protocols for the choice of patients, which must be checked for confirmation of COVID-19 with cassup testing.
By the first of March 2020, doctors in the affected area of Italy describe a situation where 10% of patients in COVID-19 need intensive care and media sources have already reached their maximum capacity.
In the hospital and/or an intensive care unit, data on COVID-19 diseases are currently available at EU/EEA level only in 6% and 1% (data not shown).
However, they should be collected regularly to fill the current monitoring data, which records the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
From 29.2 in Germany, 100,000 people per Portugal in the format of 4.2 Beds have shown a significant difference between the availability of intensive care in Europe in 2010-11 and the availability of intermediate care.
This means that countries may be less than or more than Italians (100 000 per person per year from 2010-11 to 12,5 Intensive Care and Intermediate Care Chess).
Each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom has seen a > 90% risk to print an intensive care bedding, with a wide range of COVID-19 cases being filled in, in the context of modeling health facilities, that there is an update of the ECDC's COVID-19's rapid risk assessment.
As the events still exist in EU/EEA countries and in some areas of the United Kingdom, and the Hospital and Intensive Care Unit generally provides a specific regional service to the public, it is desirable to use the regional unit's name for Level 2 (NUTS-2) for information on the impact and Intensive Care Beds.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the EU/EEA and the UK are progressing rapidly.
Therefore, the country, hospital and intensive care units that are operating in SARS-CoV-2 communities need to prepare themselves to increase the number of COVID-19 diseases, such as those in the damaged area of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, such as a rapid, pre-active and flexible approach to delay the expansion of SARS-COV-2 seizures, with changes in pressure rates, as if not implemented before, the expected increase in the number of events may not take time to weigh, accept, and respond to decisions.
Lists public health systems to reduce the impact of rapid risk assessment.
There is a short period of time when countries may increase their control efforts to reduce the rate of expansion of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health pressure.
If this fails, other EU/EEA countries may face an increase in the number of patients in need of intensive care within the next few days or weeks.
Civian Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronaviras 2 (SARS-CoV-2) killed 3,000 people in the remaining places of China and the world for their 2019 Coronaviras Diz (COVID-19), which caused more than 80,000 deaths, resulting in a disaster on humanity.
Like the global SARS-COV virus, which created SARS among several thousand people in 2003, it is likely that SARS-COV-2 could be intercepted from the outside, and the same can be observed in the same way.
However, the severity and death of COVID-19 is less than SARS, but it attacks more aggressive and more men than older men and women.
In response to many publications on emerging diseases, the paper sought a timely and comprehensive review of the issue of rapid developmental research.
We will include the primary issues of disease epidemiology, Ianology, Virology, disease diagnosis, medicine, disease rate and prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eliminate the threat of disease.
On January 25, 2020, the spring festival has become an extraordinary and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were told to stay in the house for weeks because of the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly compatible with Cornaviras (CoV) that caused the severe severe pain syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) designated it SARS-CoV-2 in February 11th, 2020 and named it CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
China's overcrowding started and rapidly spread across the country and 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 of COVID-19, including more than 40,000 patients, were released and 3,000 died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of people" and probably more powerful than terrorism."
PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) has published more than 200 articles on COVID-19 virus, epidemiology, ejacology, disease diagnosis and medical treatment, in less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020.
The review sought to summarize the progress of research on new and fast-growing issues.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coV-created disease, with the Middle East's Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 Mahamari).
We have discussed what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prevention, and some of the other issues that we have discussed.
CoVs are considered to be non-violent to humans as pathogens that generally produce about 4% of the normal cold.
Of course, in this century, we have faced a two-fold high-grade human animal coV, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which, in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia, has started a plague in 2012 and which has soon spread to many other countries with terrible prejudices and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coV feature recorded in human history.
Image 1.1 shows that the source of the caves in Neumonia was unknown on December 31, 2019, first reported to the China National Helth Commission.
Seven days later, CoV's sequence is published.
On January 15, 2020, he reported his first suicide.
Meanwhile, the sea is rapidly expanding into neighboring cities, countries and countries.
On January 20th, health care providers were reported, indicating that people could be attacked by people.
On January 23rd, the city of Uhan was locked down and all its shipments were stopped.
On January 24th, the first study of the disease said that 41 confirmed patients had direct contact with the Indian Safefood market, which was considered to be the only place to report an attack from a 21-person unknown animal.
On January 30, WHO announced the phenomenon as a global health emergency.
Until this report, the disease has already spread to almost 50 countries in China and around the world (picture 2).
The final intensity and intensity of the disaster will be determined by the rapid increase in the situation.
On 11 February, 2020, 4,021 people with confirmed COVID-19 patients submitted an additional update of the multi-centre review of the plague (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 attacked all the elderly, but it was seen mainly in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) were over 50 years of age and under 20 years of age and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 women (0.27/100,000) more men (0.31/100,000) have been assaulted.
Primarily Hubei and around him received the cover of the COVID-19.
It takes 5 (2-9) days to recover the disease from the COVID-19 source.
The average life expectancy (incubation period) was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from disease source to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
Initial generation (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the combined R0 was 2.23-4.82.
In line with the great transport time before China's spring festival, the number of people attacked was rapidly increased by 23 January 2020.
The rate of death in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the rate of death among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risks of COVID-19 are gender (man), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a precursor of large and mobile viruses that have one of the sources of Sens RNA.
These can be divided into four categories or genres, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, including alpha- and beta-coV-totals.
For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, motor cell cell (S) glycoproton is also bound to its cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptoidial peptide 4 (DPP4) and is then attached to the zilli.
Virtual RNA is released into the GNOME sitoplasm; after a copy of the Viral GNOME, Convert Glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid Proteins create a genomic RNA virion-related vesicle or vesicle, which then mixes with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is the main site of nature and is one of the 10 samples collected from Huhanan's marine food market with more than 99.98% of its genetic identity.
Compared to the MES-CoV genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is much more similar to SARS-CoV-2.
By sending electron microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 cones were found in the very small part of the human breath.
Human ACE2 was also a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 in addition to SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are more weakly bound to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 is less severe than the SARS-CoV-2 patients.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b is able to produce a small battery protein that is encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 orf3b and can also produce the protein that is encoded by the Orf8.
The ability to create orf3b viral diseases of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent the publication of IFNv can play a role; however, there is no known field or half in the orf8.
On 18 February 2020, Zhu and others reported the Crayo-EM structure of ACE2 in a mixture of B0AT1 and Amino Acid Transport.
They found that the open and closed adaptable compound was combined as a diameter, and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind two SS proteins, which provides evidence for the acceptance and seizure of CoV.
For the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 seizures, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing.
Primary and intermediate panel
It has been reported that SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV have been depleted from both productions, and it has been properly spread through the silkworms and the camel.
By comparing a Sars-CoV-2 filegenetic with other CoVs, the frog was considered to be a real SARS-CoV-2 container because bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 virus are 96% equivalent to both SARS-like viruses.
However, there are still unknown and well-defined elements of the conflict path that the midwife has helped to overcome the barrier of the population to attack.
Ji and others presented the snake as the carrier of the virus between humans, which is linked to homologas again in the S.S. protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that in Chinese traditional medicine, long-lasting pangolin is often used as an intermediate feeder based on the genetic homology of SARS-CoV-2, between the coV found in SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin.
However, the differences between the two GNOMEs are still a big difference, which is why we are still waiting for the results (image.33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown in most cases.
In a dry environment outside the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 48 hours and a minimum temperature of 20 °C and 40%-50% can survive for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to excessive acidity and heat for 30 minutes at 56 °C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-related nutrients, peracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine may effectively disable the virus other than chlorhexidine.
Overall, the entire human race is under the control of SARS-CoV-2, which is why they are at risk of being infected with the NOVEL virus.
There are currently no specific tests related to the inconsistency of SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only look at other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (picture 4).
In general, after entering a virus suit, it is characterized by the simple and uninterrupted heat of the suit through the receivers of the mark (TLR), the receiver of the suit, and the receiver of the RIG-I (RLR) such as the C-Type Lactine receiver, the Toll receiver, the NOD receiver.
Through various routes, the virus has introduced the publishers of essential issues, the density of the dentritic cells, and the analysis of Type I Interfaces (IFNs) that limits viral infection and speeds up the macrophesic phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein virus of SARS-CoV can help to prevent the reaction of the immune system.
Soon, the anti-inflammatory reaction to the disease also contributes to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in preventing them.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-sonic antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-encoded cells.
Proinflammatory cytokine is produced in order to help cells prevent the helper cells.
However, by triggering the death of CoV T cells, T cells can be prevented.
There is also a need to combat the ability of bodies such as C3a and C5a and antibodies to fight virtual attacks.
For example, different antibiotics from patients who have been treated prevent MERCS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive sensitivity of non-discrimination has created a large number of free radicals locally that can cause serious harm to the Fusfus and other limbs and, in the worst case, even to the detriment of many.
The outbreak of stroke is more likely to cause injury to the elderly and pregnant women due to an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
It's simple that people who are affected by a lot of viruses or who have weak resistance are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 patients, the estimated average life expectancy of SARS-CoV-2 (incubation) was 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 diseases showed that the incidence of the disease (incubation) was 3 days long and was between 0 and 24 days long.
According to the above description, a very recent study showed that 8,866 people were diagnosed with a life span of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the population.
On the basis of the most accurate life span, it is very important for the health authorities to agree on the effective quarantine period, while the virus is prevented from being infected by undetected people.
As a common practice, people who are infected or in contact with the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to increase to 24 days during quarantine?
In almost all cases, there are the main and primary causes of the fire of COVID-19, with which there can be no precursors, or other causes such as dry cough, breathing, fatigue, dizziness, headaches, throat disease, rhinorrhea, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and vomiting.
A week after the disease’s source, some patients felt dyspnea (swelling) and / or hypoxemia.
More importantly, the patient’s severe taste syndrome, septic shock, severe AIDS and co-pathy developed rapidly.
The signs and/or symptoms of fever and severe heart disease should be checked even though palmonary imaging is not uncommon for primary disease detection.
Towards the end of December 2019, a public survey showed that 98% of the marks were hot, 76% were dry, 55% were desperate, and 3% were diary; 8% were in need of ventilation.
A cluster of gangs (family clusters) and unmarked individuals were reported to have discovered similar findings in two recent studies.
Comparably, in 2012, a public study showed that MERCS-CoV patients were the main precursors of fever (98%), drought (47%) and dyspnia (55%).
However, they needed 80% ventilation support, which is much higher than the COVID-19 patients and is more consistent with the higher magnitude of the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat disease (21%) have also been reported.
In SARS patients, it was shown that electricity (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnoea (40% -42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat disease (13) -25%) were the main signs and that almost 14% -20% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
On 14 February, the rate of death of global COVID-19 reached 2%, on the other hand, at 66,576.
In comparison, SARS had a death rate until November 2002, 8,096 confirmed 10% of the case.
For MERCS in June 2012, the rate of death was 37% of certain diseases, based on a population survey.
A previous review revealed that 95% of the confidence interval of 5.71-7.23 (CI) was higher than the SARS-CoV-2 R0 6.47, where the SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of MRS-CoV and SARA-CoV was presented in comparison with SARS-COV-2 in relation to the death rate and R0 in comparison with SARS-COV and SARA-COV in table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV are more capable of spreading SARS-CoV-2 attacks, but it is less effective than the other two.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control the excess of SARS-CoV-2 than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The report of the disease is often in the same family or from the same ship as the sea.
In the area, there is a history of people who are affected or affected during the last two weeks of travel or residence visits to other infected places.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without prejudice and patients who have been released from the hospital can still carry the virus, which sends a warning to increase quarantine time.
The number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) is either normal or low at the primary level.
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had a white blood cell count <1 × 109/L <4 × 109/L plus lymphopenia and elevated esperate aminotransferase and viraemia. For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had a white blood cell count <1 × 109/L plus lymphopenia <4 × 109/L plus elevated esperate aminotransferase and viraemia.
Some patients had an increased level of blood clotting and special sources and myoglobins, and most patients had an increased exposure to C-reactive protein and erythrocytes.
In the case of serious disease patients, the level of D-dimmer, which increased in the blood of a fibrin-threatening product, and the number of lymphocytes decreased steadily.
Most COVID-19 patients have an abnormal radiographic of the boobs and have a bi-directional shade or vegetative opacity of the fusfus.
Patients are often diagnosed with undetected pneumonia, severe phosphuse, and severe thirst syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, unmanaged supply, supply, and progressive fibrosis poses a serious threat to gas exchange.
The unusual operation of Type-I and Type-II Neumosite reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tone, thus reducing the capacity to expand the Fusfus and increasing the risk of weakening the Fusfus.
Therefore, the worst type of quest for radiographics is often seen in the most serious area of the disease.
On 18 February, 2020, the pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed multi-nutrient cynic cells that are compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, as well as with SARS and MRS patients.
The reverse-transcrypted polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) used the SARS-COV-2 RNA marking as the main scale of the COVID-19.
However, due to a very misconceptive loss that may push the continent, since 13 February, 2020, the use of clinics or charitable publishers has started for disease (which is not only dependent on RT-PCRs).
A similar situation has occurred in the area of SARS disease.
It is therefore necessary and essential to determine the history of the disease, the donor view, the test of the investigator and the radiological search connection.
On 14 February, 2020, Feng Zhang group SARS-CoV-2 describes a protocol for the use of the CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHERLOCK) technique, which uses less than an hour of dipstic 20 × 10-18 mol/L from 200 × 10-18 mol/L (a 10-100 copy of the microlitter per input) with less than 20 × 10-18 mol/L.
If you look at the sample, you can hope to increase your sensitivity and usefulness.
Because of the experience of Novel CoV, other coV groups such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (seren (seren 2)) can provide support to the main recipients of COVID-19 with the use or treatment of various proposed therapies.
Therapeutic drugs include antiviral drugs, unresponse depression, steroids, the plasma of patients who have been diagnosed, Chinese medicine and mental support include current and possible treatment.
Even patients who were cured for treatment were offered the use of plasma.
Farms are competing to create anti-virus anti-virus anti-types and anti-types.
Sars-CoV-2 first attacked Fusfus and also probably attacked at least other limbs that reveal ACE2 such as the Gastrointestinal System and Kidney.
However, respiratory insufficiency and nausea are the main causes of the threat and death to patients.
In this way, breathless help to reduce the precipitates is essential and it saves lives, and it includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-response ventilation and a mechanical ventilation that depends on the intensity of the disease.
Patients with more severe respiratory disorders should be supported by extracorporal membrane infection (ECMO), which is an advanced cardiopalmonary bypass technology, which is used to treat fatal heart disease or respiratory disorders.
In addition, it is essential to maintain the balance of electrolyte in the case of SARS-CoV-2 patients, to prevent and treat indirect seizures and to protect the effectiveness of important limbs.
It has been reported that the reaction of excessive anti-inflammatory reactions between SARS and MERS has resulted in the disaster of cytokine.
In the case of cytokine, TNFa, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNA, IFNv, IFNγ, and MCP-1, are a form of a critical reaction to cytokine classes with release.
These cytokines are used to eliminate large numbers of free clinics with anti-infectious cells, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple limbs.
In particular, in the case of serious patients, there is no need to suppress the response to the treatment of cytokines.
Corticostroide and Tsilijumbe, an anti--IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokine disorders.
Other negative reactions to sitocain occur include T-cell-directioned resolution; IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF arrests; JAK adjuvant; Blinatumomab; Sytokin signalling 4; and HDAC adjuvants.
In order to reduce the severity of significant damage, the steroids were widely used as immunosuppressant in the treatment of SARS.
Although high-medical steroids were not useful for serious foot-and-mouth disease in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can create a major side effect, especially affecting the possibility of anaesthenic anaesthesiosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids have been suggested to be used with caution for patients with COVID-19.
No resulting antiviral therapy was confirmed until writing.
Although Remdesiver has been shown to be an agent for a U.S. disease with nucleotide analogues.
Remedesive is a novell antiviral medicine that was originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ibola and Marlburg virus.
Later, I also showed Remdesives the possible resistance to the RNA virus, including MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead provided this pair to China to carry out a series of trials against SARS-CoV-2 disabled people, and the results were highly expected.
Baricitinb (baricitinb), interferon-α, Lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin were recommended as a possible treatment for patients with severe thirst.
Diaryia, bomb thought, vomiting, liver damage and other opposite reactions may occur after lopinavir/ritonavir is combined with therapy.
Other medicinal products used in patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma and antibiotics from patients treated
There is a long history of blood clotting from infected patients to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from the disease.
In fact, patients who have been treated often have a relatively high level of antibacterial activity relative to the pathogen.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight against animals and other external objects and identify and directly acknowledge the unique elements of the pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 and injected into 10 serious disease patients.
Their precursors were increased within 24 hours, and their supply and viral load were reduced and the blood oxygen ratio improved.
Although the specific therapies have not yet been developed and it is necessary to check and clarify ways to use greatness.
In addition, in view of medical effects, some of the disorders associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibiotics can exacerbate the response to disease prevention and can cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially lethal.
Blood antibodies are generally low, and plasma is required to treat patients with disease.
It is difficult to rapidly develop and create antibiotics at a certain level against the global continent.
It is therefore more important to separate B cells from the patients who have been diagnosed and to identify more important and effective anti-virus proteins to monitor effective antibodies or encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibiotics.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of several elements in a formula that is changed based on TCM activity.
Most of the active elements are unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and test such elements or their compatible mixtures.
Currently, in the absence of effective and specific treatment of COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternatives for mild to moderately impaired patients or to patients coming back from a serious stage.
For example, it was reported that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua King Wen capsules were effective in treating COVID-19.
Many Chinese patients were treated with COVID-19, where 87% of patients were treated with TCM, where the highest rates were found, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninja (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in the country where COVID-19 patients were only used with CCM 30%, the lowest rates were (13%).
However, this is very straightforward because the number of patients and other factors such as intensity should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues compared WM and TCM to Western medicine.
They saw that the temperature of the body was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM+TCM group.
Most attractively, the symbolic abbreviation rate (lightly severe) for the WM+TCM group was significantly lower than for the WM group (7.4% nickname 46.2%) and for the WM+TCM death group was lower than for the WM group (8.8% nickname 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM's performance and safety levels are higher and more focused on more self-controlled testing.
It will be interesting to specify whether or not the effective components or combinations of TCMs are available and if possible.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are very aggressive and even fearful of life-threatening diseases, and people in quarantine also feel lonely, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of seizures such as fever, hypoxia, cough, and medication can lead to anxiety, and mental pressure, such as cancer caused by corticosteroids.
At the initial stage of SARS's performance, various types of psychiatric precursors have been reported, including long-term neglect, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor effects, psychotic precursors, delirium, and even suicide.
As part of the public response to the tragedy of COVID-19, mandatory contact tracking and quarantine people can create more anxiety and guilt about the impact of clashes between quarantine and their families and friends.
Therefore, COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have come into contact with them and should also provide mental health care to ordinary people who need it.
Mental assistance should include the development of mental health teams from one of the medical branches, regular and accurate communication with SARS-CoV-2's physical and medical plans and close contacts with professional electronic devices and applications.
Effective vaccines are needed and often complemented by antiviral medicine in the control of the emerging virus to prevent the transmission of sensitive clothing from animals and infected people.
S-protein-based vaccines have been tried to develop long-term and highly resistant antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective insecurity.
Live-attuned ticks have been tested in the animal models of SARS.
However, before starting a medical study, there is still no protection against the spread of human viral infection from efficacy and animal sources in older people and in the life-cycle challenge model.
This is probably because SARS was destroyed 17 years ago and no new attacks have been reported since.
In contrast, incidents and incidents continue to continue in the middle of the Middle East and spread to other areas due to the existence of a joint source in the affected area.
Active viruses, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanopartics, virus-like worms and recombinant protein subunits have been developed for the mers, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
An important and important task for people who are indifferent to SARS-CoV-2 is to control a safe and effective ticket that is being made.
Although it takes a long time (on average 18 months) for Vaccine to develop, and because of the rapid change in the CoV group, this disorder is challenging.
As an infectious disease, the full Danish course of COVID-19 has begun to be fully developed for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients with no prior disease can get relief slowly.
Like SARS and Mers, however, COVID-19 is associated with much more disease and death in patients with serious diseases.
Therefore, it is essential for health services agencies, especially in areas with limited facilities, to make their services a priority model for the disease.
The following reasons may affect or be associated with the rate of disease in patients with COVID-19:
Age: Age was the most important reason for the result of SARS, which is true in the case of COVID-19.
In comparison with the 8,866 diseases described above, 47.7% of patients aged 30-65 were among the main adults with COVID-19.
Other patients who needed care were more likely to be hospitalized and complex, and they were significantly older than others (middle age of 66 years) who indicated the rate of disease for the outcome of COVID-19.
Gender: male SARS-CoV-2 attacks are higher than female (0.31/100,000 nicknames 0.27/100,000) described above.
The existence and complexity of a number of diseases: COVID-19 patients who need advanced service are more likely to have severe heart attacks and sufferers in arrhydmia.
In addition, cardiovascular events were the main cause of the death of SARS patients.
It has also been reported that ACE2-positive collagen site can also be linked to SARS-CoV-2, which could lead to the wrong actions of COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying diseases are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal data found in the investigator: blood C-reactive protein (CRP) reflects the severity of the infection in the body or tissue and is proposed as an indication of the rate of disease possible for disease, treatment response, and terminal recovery.
The CRP level also proposed mutual relations between COVID-19 and the intensity and predictability of the COVID-19.
In addition, advanced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and a creative kinez (CK) can also help predict the impact.
These sources are widely distributed, especially in terms of heart rate and heart rate, and the loss of cells.
Therefore, they are a progressive sign for heart failure or worthlessness.
Main contributory prefixes: the complexity and predictability of COVID-19 should be considered in conjunction with other problems related to Book Radiography and Donate Prefixes.
Use of Steroids: Immunospressant is commonly used as a primary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of significant damage.
Since high levels of corticosteroids were used extensively among the most serious SARS patients, many survivors suffered from long-term disability and low living standards in the Avascule Absconcrosis.
Therefore, steroids should be used for low doses and short periods of time for COVID-19 patients if necessary.
Mental pressure: As described above, many patients often suffered prolonged quarantine and severe insecurity during the COVID-19 period and suffered from the death of family members and patients.
It is essential to provide mental advice and long-term assistance to help these patients get rid of their mental pressure and return to normal life.
According to public studies, COVID-19 is still considered to be different from SARS.
In addition to making a copy below the breathline, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively create a copy at the top of the breathline and does not cause a mild or mild precipitation at the primary level of the attack, which is similar to other coVs responsible for normal colding.
Therefore, patients with high levels of disease can cause a lot of virus during their daily work during primary or early stages of disease control.
However, if patients became seriously ill, they would have been aware that SARS-CoV occurred when most of the attacks did not occur at the initial stage.
Thus, the current practice of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the practice of SARS.
In China, efforts are under way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 diseases, including the lockdown of Uhan and the surrounding cities and the almost total population.
While these actions have been detrimental to the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new diseases is falling, indicating that the excess is slowing down.
It is hoped that the outbreak of the disease will end in March and that the underlying disease will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others assumed that the COVID-19, which is being represented as a sufficient attacker of SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the earthquake and indicated that the two thirds of the global population of SARS-CoV-2 could be attacked.
A Canadian group reported that in both areas of mid-tarbinette and throat-free patients, saRS-CoV-2 were identified in the mid-tarbinettes and golls, indicating that the newly identified virus would become a similar trend as influenzaner.
However, on the basis of the number of new cases, there are hopeful indications in China that the current plans can continue to work.
It was initially predicted that Ibola would cause a million deaths with half a million deaths.
However, through severe quarantine and divorce, this disease has been controlled to the end.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attacks may become weak and may eventually be destroyed or may become a virus that is less likely to occur with humans.
Sars and Mers are compared to COVID-19 (picture 55).
Cosy or cracks, and possibly also through direct contact with the virus's contaminated element, are also very likely to be offensive to SARS-CoV-2.
The virus was also found in Mole, which has highlighted the new possibility of a confrontation with Mol-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-Te-
A recent study on 138 people revealed that 41% of the cases of the disease were probably caused by a non-socomial attack (born in the hospital), including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
In this way, people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, employees and even people with disabilities must take sufficient care to protect those who are close to them.
The masks can be used as the first stage of defense to reduce the risk of conflict; the use of the surgical masks and the N95 suction masks (series #1860s) helps control the virus range.
Social Facebook masks may prevent the spread of small waves of lightning from spreading through the air or on the surface of the object, where they could spread among others.
However, only N95 (series #1860s) can protect against taking a small wire through breath like 10 to 80 nm masks, only 5% can fully access the wire; SARS-CoV-2 sizes of SARS-CoV are equal to and almost 85 nm.
Since the mice can even enter the five-fold surgical mask, patients should not have a surgical mask, N95 (serious#1860s) must be replaced.
In addition to the mask of health service providers for further contact with the virus, the size of the isolation gun should be exceeded.
The virus can also invade the person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was attacked in SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing N95 masks; the virus probably entered his body through his apparent eye.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear a transparent face covering or Google when working with patients.
In areas affected or possibly affected by the public, it is recommended that each person has more than normal to wash his hands with soap, try to be inside the house to quarantine himself, and possibly to limit the contact of those who are infected.
It is considered appropriate to stay away from a patient.
In addition to reducing the risk of the outbreak of the approved system, it is an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was a new virus in the human world, according to the report of January 7, 2020, it was expected to be highly similar to SARS-CoV because of the deep memory of the 2003 SARS tragedy.
However, until January 19, 2020, the Director of the Center for Disease Control has comforted citizens that the novell virus is less infectious and human reproductive capacity is limited and there is no problem with the prevention and control of the disease.
The message was a major threat to the public, especially when the whole country was preparing for the summer festival and the time to suppress the disease was at least wasted.
China's disease control agencies can accept this harsh teaching and make an inexhaustible improvement in the future.
For example, these organizations must be more cautious when announcing (1) because each word will consider and change their attitude and decision; (2) without waiting for the official reports of doctors or officers, they must be more sensitive and responsive to the unsolicited information received from clinics; (3) rather than trying to comfort the general public, it will be more controlling to push the tides at an early stage; and (4) to increase public awareness of the disease and to monitor and improve how society reacts to the disease.
Novell Virus SARS-CoV-2's development of COVID-19 started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and it spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-COV and also similar between the baselines of COVID-19 and SARS, COVID-19 has developed a feeling of return to SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are needed to treat depression and patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and women more than men and death rates than those of youth.
More than COVID-19 deaths in SARS (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Although COVID-19 patients have been infected with virus without detection, SARS patients usually have a serious disease that makes it much more difficult to suppress COVID-19 attacks than SARS.
It explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 has spread faster and more widely than SARS-COV.
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, patients who benefit from treatment may be positive for the virus again.
These findings increase the risk of viral spread.
The study in COVID-19 contains a number of important issues to address as soon as possible in its consideration of progress:
Where did Sars-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the SARS-CoV-2 and two bats have been found in the SARS-type CoV, we still cannot reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 has been decommissioned.
What kind of animal existed between humans, such as the antelope, and what was the source of the virus?
Without the answer to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the spread of the conflict and the disaster can come back at any time.
Although psychological modelling and bioassays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how does the virus enter the brain properly and make further pathological changes?
Does the virus also capture other ACE2 cells?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to obtain rapid and effective diagnosis and effective treatment.
How many days is it going to be?
How does the virus expand genetically during human surgery?
Will it become a global overtime, death like SARS, or some time after the flu?
This is indispensable, but it takes some time to find answers to the above and many more questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the storm as quickly as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
The animal source of the human carnival virus
For thousands of years of transformation and adaptation, Kornaviras (CoV) and the human race have led to their change in clothing.
Two human CoV (HcoV) were known as a common soil before 2003 as the cause of mild disease.
The currency has shown behind it how destructive and deadly the HPOV attack can be to reveal the consequences of the severe severe SHYR syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East SHYR syndrome (MERS).
By the end of 2019, the rise of SARS-CoV-2 in China has brought CoV shots back to the head of the discussion, and it has surprised us by showing a high degree of aggressiveness and low-sickness compared to our sister SARS-CoV.
The HCoV crisis is an animal disease and can help us to think about the joint source of HCoV.
Most HCoVs have been invented since the fall, where they are less diseased.
Among some of the HCV groups are also known as primary asylum seekers.
Animal nutrition has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
In animals, the coV-responsor may also provide an important insight into the human condition of the coV.
In this review, we are giving a brief description of the knowledge of the seven HCVs that exist, focusing on their animal sources and internal conflicts beyond their history.
Importantly, we are comparing and comparing different HCVs from the perspective of the re-connection of GNOME.
In this context, the current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been discussed.
In addition, the impact of the change in the need for successful asylum and the spread of the disease has also been seen.
Kornaviras (CoV-Samoh) is a family in Kornaviride, which includes a group of positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA virus.
"The largest viruses in RNA viruses 26 to 32 kilobytes were called "CoV" under the electron microscope because of the U.S.
In a structured way, the CoV team has an indistinguishable GNOME that is the same organization.
About two thirds of GNOME have two large open-reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into ppp1a and ppp1ab replicas of polyprotein.
The polyproteins are used to produce 16 more non-structured proteins called nsp1~16.
The rest of GNOME includes ORFs for building proteins, including cells (S), modules (E), cells (M) and nucleoprotein.
Some linear-sonic accessory proteins are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoV shots are classified into four populations (alpha-Kovi, beta-Kovi, gamma-Kovi and Delta-Kovi), most of which include HCV in the beta-Cov population and are divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
National evidence has shown that birds and birds act mostly as genetic sources of Alpha-CoV and Bit-CoV, on the other hand, as the principal source of Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, the CoV Group has been overmining international barriers and has manifested itself as a number of major human diseases.
So far, seven human CoVs have been known.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other five-bit HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, Civilian Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HcoV-OC43, HcoV-HKU1 and HcoV-NL63 generally generate slight signs such as common fluids and / or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and drug detection SARS-CoV-2 are very sick, severe respiratory disorders (acute respiratory dysentery syndrome, ARDS) and most of the patients expected to experience severe low respiratory disorders that are expected to occur outside of Fusfus.
The first HCV-229E stren, was collected from the neck of ordinary armed patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through an extensive study of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which have a self-restraint.
In fact, the idea was widely accepted until SARS came to light that the HPVs were usually indiscriminate.
In 2003, the SARS disaster was one of the most devastating events in recent history, which had devastated 8,000 people and the rate of unresolved death was about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East syndrome (MERS) caused the Arab subcontinent to continue to spread and spread into the rest of the world.
2019 Novell HCoV (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-CoV-2, is the current agent for Kornaviras disease 2019 (COVID-19), which resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 deaths by 3 March 2020.
The world is playing an alarm clock and must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCV strains has a feed source from the eggs, eggs, or pets.
More evidence supports all HCV variables, where viruses are well-adjusted and non-sick but poor genetic diversity is shown.
COVID-19 has presented major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
The search for the animal source of HCoV provides a framework to explain the reasons for the restriction of natural history, driving power and population.
This can guide or guide the search for the foundation of SARS-CoV-2 with important issues to prevent future spillover.
In this review, we are presenting a summary of the animal source of HCV, intra-national seizures and disease.
In particular, we want to look at this general context and discuss that the beneficial viruses of the HCoV team are usually among their natural base guardians but are sick after entering the body of the new sponsor.
We also review the nature of the change in HCV, which often reduces disease with increased resistance.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 projection have also been discussed in this regard.
The CoV is known from the late 1930s to the late 1930s.
In the first collection of HCV-229E strains, different coVs were collected in different infected animals, including turkeys, eggs, pigs, pigs, turkeys and dogs, before the first collection of HCV-229E strains.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCV discovery (series 1) will be comprehensive and educational.
The first HCV-229E strand in 1966 was separated from the breathing tract of the patients in the upper respiratory tract and was subsequently adjusted to increase the WI-38 Fusfus cell line.
The HCoV-229E was characterized by headaches, headaches, nausea, and general coldness, and 10~20% of the patients were exposed to fire and closeness.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected in Argan Kalkar and later in the amphibian brain from the recurrent growth of the virus.
The clinical characteristics of the HCV-OC43 seizure are similar to those of HCV-229E, which cannot be significantly distinguished from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are mainly contaminated in the winter climate.
Usually, these two viruses are less than a week, and then they get about two weeks of disease.
In a study of human volunteers, healthy people with HCV-229E have developed mildly common thirst.
Only a few inadvertent preventions were seen among the most serious low-sweetened patients.
"SARS, also known as "Atiptical Neumonia", was the first-ever HCOV-born mother-in-law written in human history, and was responsible for his delegation to SARS-CoV, which was the third discovered HCOV."
The first case of SARS is found in Guangdong, China, toward the end of 2002.
The SARS earthquake has led to reports of 8,096 events across many countries and continents, including 774 deaths.
In addition to super-sponders, it was estimated that each case could increase almost two related cases, with incubation pilots from 4 to 7 days and being present on the 10th day of illness.
In SARS-CoV patients, the disease is seen primarily as a patient’s disease, headache, fever, feeling unwell and cold, as a long-lasting sign of respiratory, cough and respiratory pain.
Lymphopinia, poor liver function testing and increased creatinine kineze are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
In SARS patients, there is also an increase in the damage of isolated alvila, the cell range and macrophages.
Almost 20-30% of patients later need intensive care and technical ventilation.
In addition to low breaths, most of the gastrointestinal tract, including caustic and Kidney, may be involved in this serious event, which is usually associated with cytokines that may be particularly fatal for patients with severe heart disease.
The virus was first collected from the biopsy of an open-air family of an Indian patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, much effort has been devoted to HCV research.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands.
It is primarily among young children, elderly and infirm patients with reduced disease resistance.
The common disease caused by HCV-NL63 in Korea, the eye, light and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study describes a collection of the same virus from an 8-month-old male cancer sample in Neumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was registered in the Netherlands, it is worldwide.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is the cause of nearly 4.7% of the common respiratory disease and has occurred most in the early days of winter, winter and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to abstract larinthitis, which is also known as croup.
At the same time, the HCoV-HKU1 was collected from 71-year-olds in Newmonia and Burkina Faso in Hong Kong.
In addition to the group-produced pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with severe respiratory disease.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 have been found worldwide, which is due to mild smell disease.
All of these four groups of HCOVs have been well-founded with people and are generally less likely to be transformed into highly pathogenic diseases, although there has been an unknown accident, such as the very harmful occurrence of HCOV-NL63 subtypes that have recently been reported to have been the severe outbreak of low blood pressure in China.
In general, when these HCV groups have the ability to attack and keep themselves united between people, they become less harmful or less aggressive than expected.
MERS-CoV was first collected from Fusfus, a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia who caused severe pneumonia and racial failure.
Although most of the developments in the laboratory have come from the Middle East, there have been reports of cases coming from outside the European countries and Tunisia between close contacts with the second level.
In 2015 there was another second-class tradition in South Korea, where 186 cases were found.
MPS's contributions are similar to SARS's.
In addition to SARS, severe renal impairment has occurred in many patients with MERS, which is still strange in the case of HCV.
More than 30% of patients have breast diseases such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 investigators have confirmed that more than 34.4% of deaths have occurred, one of the most deadly viruses for human beings.
From mid-December 2019 to the end, the categories of patients affected in Neumonia were identified in Uhana, China, as related to the SARS-CoV-2 incident.
The World Health Organization SARS-CoV-2 has declared the ongoing nature of the low respiratory crisis to be a public state of international concern and has called this disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, the total loss of death was 3.4%, with 90.053 worldwide.
Significantly, in China, the rate of animal mortality in Hobei is 4.2%, on the other hand 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 is a hot, cosy and breathless event that is presented as SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV.
Some patients may also be diagnosed with Diarrhea.
Neumonia may be one of the most deadly signs and the crisis of the severe respiratory system in the syndrome.
Although 82% of the high nucleotide sequences are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, they are clustered in different branches of the National Tree.
In the obvious, SARS-CoV-2 is less diseased than SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 case has been reported undetected and can play a role in spreading it worldwide.
Six others compare and compare SARS-CoV-2 with HCV.
First of all, the time of the outbreak of the disease and the time of the HCV course is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general gravity of the other six HCVs.
Secondly, the intensity of the baselines of COVID-19 is between four HCV infected in SARS-CoV and the public (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 seizures show characteristics that are generally non-specific, slight or even unmarked in the course of the population-led HCV attacks.
On the other hand, in a small part of the major areas of COVID-19, there are signs of SARS-COV violations, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 attack group shows the classic displays of HCV and both SARS-CoV.
At the same time, the aggression of SARS-CoV-2 is more like a group-derived HCV group.
On the other hand, for SARS-CoV and for MERCS-CoV, there is still evidence that there is a decline in the ability of humans to respond to SARS-CoV-2.
Finally, like other HCVs, Sars-CoV-2 moles can be detected.
At least in some situations, whether SARS-COV plays an important role in the confrontation of SARS-COV-2 in future studies remains to be seen.
As the community-based HCV group SARS-CoV-2 shows, it is particularly important to show whether or not it is so dependent.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including its vulnerability, illness and the spread of technology, will have an impact on the final outcome of the ongoing tragedy of COVID-19.
The four group-produced HCoVs, who create mild marks, have been able to communicate well with all people.
From a different point of view, it can also be true that these four people have adapted well to HCV.
In other words, both ancient HCVs can be highly hereditary.
The most serious human disease caused by the HCV group and those that developed the most serious HCV disease.
In order to do this, HCVs must be copied in sufficient quantity to allow people to make the necessary changes to fight against the causes of the limitation of the security.
In other words, the longer the experience of SARS-CoV-2 and the more people will get involved in it, the more likely it will be to be able to deal with people as fully as possible.
If it is well established, it will be difficult for humans to stop the attack by other means of quarantine or control.
For many years, the four groups are spreading to the human population, and common resistance among the patients involved is the source of the common cold.
These viruses don't need any animal feed.
On the contrary, very sick SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV are not well adjusted and cannot continue to be a conflict between humans.
They need to remain and expand in the juridical frameworks and are likely to be able to spread to human targets through one or more medium-sized and expanding clothing.
SARS-CoV-2 features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-based HCV, both.
At least until now, it's as powerful as community-based HCV.
However, it is more than a group-based HCV group and less than SARS-CoV or MERC-CoV.
It has to be seen whether it is fully compatible with humans and whether it continues to spread among humans without any medium or medium-sized food.
Before discussing the animal source of HCV, we will be able to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the variable, natural, foundation, middle and extension guardians of HCV.
An animal acts as a variable fashioner of HCV if it protects close-related prejudices by sharing high levels of nucleotide homology.
The father virus is usually good for the body of the refugee and is non-infectious.
Thus, a fundamental refugee protects HCoV indiscriminately and for the long-term.
In both cases, the refugees are physically assaulted and they are natural defenders of the HCV or its parental virus.
On the contrary, if a mid-term refugee is newly identified before or just around the HCV person, it does not fit the new person well and is often sick.
In the middle, the refugee can act as a source of animal life and then play an increasing role in the spread of the human body through the invasion of human bodies.
If HCV cannot continue to interfere with the respondent, the attack may be accelerated.
Otherwise, the HCoVs can also be adjusted with the middle dresser and the long-term procouple can begin.
In this case, the middle dress becomes a natural garment.
The story of the plague revealed that animals had a history of contact with the SARS incident.
The following findings suggest that anti-SARS-CoV IgG was more common in animal business than in general.
Gorggokul (Pagoma Larvata) and a racous dog were first identified as carrying viruses like SARS-COV, which were almost like SARS-COV.
It was explicitly supported by this information that there was no further occurrence of SARS after the slaughter of all mushrooms in the markets.
However, it has been found that, without contact with live animal markets, the hairy palm syves were largely negative for SARS CoV, which indicates that the hairy palm clusters would only serve as a medium-sized shelter, but not as a natural basis for SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80% of the Guangzhou market has anti-SARS-COV antibodies of different species, it is not possible to avoid the possibility that many small mammals can work as an enhancer between SARS-COV.
All of these are considered to be a front of SARS-CoV.
Following the natural animal feeder of SARS-CoV, a close-related bat CoV was published, known as SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists on the Chinese Herssun boat. The following was published by a close-related bat CoV, SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 (SARSr-BatCoV HKU3).
Positive for Sars-CoV anti-fraud and for the GNOME sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other odd CoV shares 88-92% of nucleotide sequences of Homology SARS-CoV.
These studies are based on the new idea that birds provide shelter for vulnerable human beings.
More than a few SARS have been detected (SL-CoV-Smuh), but only one selective HIV1 cannot be collected as a live virus.
Human Angiotensin convertor enzyme 2 (ACE2) known as SARS-CoV.
For access to the WIV1 cell from the mold sample, it was shown as a receiver, for use in civil and human ACE2.
Funnyly, SARS was able to disable WIV1's scars of patients who are being cured.
Until now, WIV1 is represented by the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV, which shares 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although these two viruses have high-level homologies, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-COV is not the immediate parental virus and that the outbreaks are not the immediate source of SARS-COV.
File genetic analyses classified BAT CoV-HKU4 and BAT CoV-HKU5 in the same category.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and Mers-CoV virus access using the same host receiver, diptipidil wallpapers 4 (DPP4).
The RNA-Virver MERS-CoV's RNA polymers sequences are naturally close to images of bats found in Europe and Africa.
So far, there's been no mers-CoV gangs in the rainforests.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, the cracks can also be a source of immediate protection for the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a study in the Middle East found that a coarse camel is a seropisive for specified adjuvant antibodies, just like those of the Middle East in several African countries.
Like the human virus, the live Mers-CoV was collected from the soybean bear's nose, which also indicates that the camel acts as the real base of the Mers-CoV.
It should also be noted that although there are generally slight signs of viral infection (viral shading) occurring in tested camels by MRS-CoV.
Significantly, infected camels not only by means of breathing, but also by the Maldbar-orthodox route, which is the main route to spread the virus from the hole.
However, the questions are still left because there was no history of contact with the camel of many sure diseases of the mark, perhaps in the path of human or unknown animals that protect the Mers-CoV.
The bat collected from the Rainolophas amphibians is 96.2% compatible with SARS-CoV-2's nuclear homology.
In the field of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, such as SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, there is much more to establish the sequence of differences and parental relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
This means that in the future, if almost cov can't be found, it could be the direct base of SARS-CoV-2.
Perhaps the animal shelter between SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild animals sold and killed in the Juan Sifud Picari market, which included the first many of the COVID-19 cases, which may indicate an animal-to-human incident.
A number of recent studies have suggested that a group of small pets known as Manis Javanica may carry the birthplaces of SARS-CoV-2.
This Novell Bonroy CoV represents 85-92% of GNOME's nucleotide sequences of Homology SARS-CoV-2.
However, with almost 90% of the nucleotide sequences, they are associated equally with RatG13.
They're tied into two sub-sub-sections of the SARS-CoV-2 in a national tree, where 97.4% share the same prescription binding domain (RBD) with a SARS-CoV-2 with which the amino acid sequence is identified.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are even more confused, even though Sequence Homology is the highest degree.
In a previous study on disease canals, Fusfus samples also reported the detection of virus sequences which are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study included some 86.3% of the total duration of the study, and a variety of assembly methods and manual presentations were adopted.
We cannot overlook the possibility that Pangolin is one of the most important animal feeders in SARS-CoV-2.
However, Sars-CoV-2 and Bonrui SARS-CoV-2-related bits – there is no evidence for the direct division of the SarS-CoV-2 source.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is lower than between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonrui-related SARS-CoV-2.
The development of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet under way between the frogs, the pangoline and other mammals.
Although most of the Sars-CoV-2 and Banrui RBDs found sequential homology, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-suppression, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share most of the sequential homology.
It is extremely remote that Bonru is driven by a high-comparency variation between the beta-CoV-related RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and the high-quality electorate-mediated revolution between SARS-CoV-2.
A change of proposal for a rebound between the third wild animal breed, Sars-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RatG13.
As a dynamic force for change, the bita-coV group is re-connected.
The direct feed source of SARS-CoV-2 is still not well known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, animal sources of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 have been studied.
The file-genetic evidence indicates that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E were derived from both battery coVs, although the parental viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 were found in cells.
ARCoV.2 (Apalasian rice CoV) has been reported to have shown a close relationship between the three-ringed ARCoV in North America with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E was genetically related to another bat called Hipposidros / Ghanakowam/19/2008, although the comedians were also suspected of being amongst them.
For transparency, the known animal source of the HCV group is summarized in the current knowledge image 1 and Table 2.
In the history of ethnic analysis, the end of the CoV Group has provided evidence of the events of the ethnic conflict.
By 1890, when the HCoV-OC43 exceeded the population of the domestic animal, there was an overcrowd of breath.
The history of the international invasion of the HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of the closely related fractures with HCV-229E have been found.
They have an Alpha Alpha CoV.
A number of evidence supports the outbreak of the virus in humans.
First, in a divided environment, people may be out of touch with people, but not with the Alps.
Instead, people have close contact with the Alps.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related monkeys are different and non-infectious among the Alpha-CoV group, while alpaca alpha-CoV-infected animals are akin to respiratory disease.
Eventually, Alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible that the alpacas receive alpha-CoV related to HCV-229E from humans.
In fact, Rebiz virus, Ibola virus, Nipha virus, and Hendra virus have been released as a direct source of human disease virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that adults can directly invade HCV-229E.
On the other hand, Alfa-CoV-Samoh acts as a Gin pool of HCV-229E, but can act as a refuge between the Alpha and a Khujawala camels that penetrate the virus between humans, just as in the case of MERCS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is a poor example of the spread of international conflict between humans and a measles and a measles.
MERS-CoV's variable source is known from the beginning and is enhanced by further research.
It is clear that the outbreak of genocide and international conflict provides a rich foundation for the international exchange of the virus population.
Long-term, horribly full of hate, close social contributions and strong flight skills are a good example of being a 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in contact with a turtle camel a few decades ago.
It fits these camels well, which has become a stable and natural base of an intermediate refugee.
Mers-CoV causes very slight diseases and maintains the rate of low conversion expected among these animals.
The insurgency between humans is an accident and the human being is the last defender of the MERS-CoV because it cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV attack, the role of the car in the SARS-CoV-2 attack is different if it is from the role of the Pangoolin.
In particular, the Pangolin Bit -- CoV-suppressive Pangolins are very sick.
In the case of SARS-CoV, they may be the last guarantor for SARS-CoV-2-related bit-CoVs.
Various possibilities for human invasion from the internal-national animal of SARS-CoV-2 may include or cancel research in the future.
First of all, the outbreaks may be the main sponsor of a SARS-CoV-2 virus like the SARS-CoV-2.
People can share environmental cologne with frogs through frogs or koala mines.
Secondly, the mosquitoes may be one of the rising refugees in which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has been newly introduced.
People are infected with the virus by cutting the meat and eating.
It is possible that many pet animals with pets are not protected in SARS-CoV-2.
An examination of the sheltered and forested animals is ensured for the antibodies.
Third, as indicated above, the revitalisation and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third generation, which has contacts with both the bar and the Pangolin.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the various types of animal shelters, three main reasons for the virtual side are also important for helping the CoV to overcome international barriers.
First, they have a relatively high rate of conversion per RNA.
"Other single-source (stranded) RNA viruses can be considered to be "high" and the rate of average replacement will be 2 per year, depending on the decade of the CoV-supply CoV adaption.
The coV team has a prof-reading xoribonuclide, which results in too high mobility and weakness or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesives are called the Xoribonneuclides and RNA-river RNA polymerases by forming a coV image.
Remdesiver is one of the most likely anti-SARS-CoV-2 elements tested in Indian trailers.
However, CoV-supply rates are nearly one million times more than their insurers.
In addition, when coV-totals are not able to handle properly, the rate of conversion is often higher.
Compared with the higher conversion rate of SARS-CoV, the conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, which indicates a more easy way to deal with people.
Perhaps it has already adapted to another refugee near man.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also applicable to MERCS-CoV, which fits well with a yellow horse.
In fact, the genetic drift vaccine and antivirals of SARS-CoV-2 will be very low.
Secondly, the large RNA of CoV uses additional courtesy for the re-linking and re-connecting of the RNA of CoV, which increases the possibility of changes with internal components, which will be useful for the rise of the CoV-sweetness when the situation becomes convenient.
This is supported by many unique open-reading frames and protein functions on the 3′ side of GNOME.
"Third, CoV-smooth randomly and often a different "copy-choice" process changes the templates when copying RNA."
The security agent who works as a mixing agent has often been side-to-side switching during the coV RNA copy.
High-national full-length and undernamed RNAs can be re-connected to create a new CoV set.
The biogenic evidence of natural renaissance was found between both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and animal coV-species such as boat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Reciprocal anti-virus activity
In addition to the three virtual elements described above, the virtual delivery with host receivers is another major reason for the international conflict.
In it, SARS-CoV is again taken as an example, which also showed positive election evidence during the international conflict.
On the basis of comparable analysis between the human and the Gorggokul SARS-CoV group, the SARS-CoV is considered to be able to respond rapidly to the transformation of the SBD protein into different refugees.
In general, an S protein of a CoV interacts with RBD celluler receptor and is highly selected by the host antibiotic response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD has 318 to 510 amino acid in the S1 Tukrat, which is also bound to the coriceptors for virtual access to human ACE2.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including cats, lions and sharks, which can cause international virus attacks.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues in humans and in RBD have been found to be different from Gorggokul Viral Isolates, and 4 of them are in the customer-container plan to interact with ACE2 clients.
Sivet SARS-CoV RBD has K479N and S487T transfers, which can increase the ability of the human ACE2 receptor to deliver Spy protein.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be important for adjusting the virus.
It is noted that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the key customers.
The differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV's S1 protein units indicate that human S protein binding with ACE2 may change.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10 to 20-fold higher bound density than between human ACE2 and SARS-COV S.
It is also necessary to determine whether any other consignee may be required for the SARS-CoV-2 attack.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but to different parts of S.
There are many more HCV clients, such as HCV-229E for aminoptide N and HCV-OC43 for 9-O-asitated silicone acid.
They can also be counted as the reason for the success of this COV group of people after being attacked by their animal savers in the international community.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of the international attacks by the HCoV team are also guided by the dependability and limitations of other refugees.
The division of the host proteins between humans and the HCoV group's natural origins, such as frogs, worms, and snakes, can hinder international invasion of the host proteins.
The HCoVs must take over the security reasons for a successful international attack and destroy the security limits.
In this respect, there is still room for identifying and describing the characters in this important area of the virus-response.
Using CRISPR's innovative technology, the security of SARS-CoV-2 and an independent Gnome-Wide Screening Program may result.
The Rise of Novell HCoV: Return to where it was started
The Bat CoV team provides sufficient opportunities to raise the Novel HCoV team.
In other words, Bat CoV-smooth acts as a gene pool of the HCV-smooth.
In addition, rapid traffic and genetic re-connection are driven by the change in HCV and are two important steps in this process.
For example, novell's protein-coding genes have the ability to take control of the missing viral phenotypes or to remedy them severely.
Between SARS-CoV and related proteins, ORF8 was considered important for humans to be treated because SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but were shown to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The attribute of removing a 29-nucleotide from the SARS-CoV team was found in the chains that were collected at the beginning of the human continent.
This removal divides ORF8a and ORF8b into ORF8a and it seems to be an adjusted transformation that encourages security change.
In addition, there is a possible recovery history of SARS-CoV with the Alpha- and Gamma-CoV strains, where a large number of RNA-dependent polymers have been identified as small areas.
Nsp9, most nsp10 and nsp14 parts were also listed.
Similarly, it has been shown that the Great Mers-CoV has been re-linked between different tribes, which had happened in the field of a yellow horse in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV, other HCV cases have been observed, where HCV is re-entered with other animals in non-constructive genes.
It should also be cautioned that human selection can contribute to unwanted changes in the virtual GNOME, possibly due to the release of viruses from election pressures like the host immune system.
Examples of these effects are the loss of ORF4 full length in the HCV-229E prototype source due to the removal of double-nucleotide.
Although ORF4 HCV-229E can be seen on the axis in the camel virus, Alpaca Alpha-CoV shows that a single nucleotide is in place, the frame shift results.
The change in the final but important, novell HCoVs is also driven by the pressure to choose their basic clothing.
When the coV attacked the monkeys, they were undetected or only identified their slight marks, indicating mutual adjustments between the coV group and the monkey.
It has been shown that the frogs are well suited to the CoV group from the point of view and physically.
For example, the pathology driven by CoV-supply reduces the error of reacting to self-inflicted reactions among adults.
In addition, the NKG2/CD94 and the main histocompatibility complex I are understated because of the low level of exposure to natural harmful cells.
In addition, the high-responsive levels of high levels of acidic acidity produced by the outbreak can push the image of CoV (ROS) and exert pressure on the virus when it comes to contacting a new refugee.
More diseased CoV strains can also be developed through rescaling which leads to new protein or protein character acquisitions for asylum seekers.
Therefore, it is not possible that three new HCoVs have developed over the past two decades.
CoV-suppression creates mild signs of non-infectious or their main refugees, such as frogs and camels.
They are growing rapidly without a strong resistance.
Why the unmarked carrier appears and what is most important in the human crisis is included in the secret matter.
The most important signs are the increased activation of anti-inflammatory reactions and the intensity of anti-inflammatory reactions by the cytokine storm.
On the contrary, in the case of unmarked carriers, the resistance response has been distinguished from the CoV image.
An anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy may have a beneficial effect on disconnection of resistance response.
Interferen's reaction is particularly strong.
Therefore, the use of Type I interfaces should be useful in at least one SARS-CoV-2 conflict.
In addition, NLRP3 is a critical activation error in the cracks.
With this argument, the NLRP3 inflammazom with MCC950 in the treatment of COVID-19 may be effective.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common issues that raised SARS-CoV and MERCS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat-bit-coV was found that provided 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-coV, and on the other hand a bat-coV that provided 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-coV-2.
Although it has been reported that the viruses like SARS-CoV have been secured in the market, the immediate intermediaries could not be identified for SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly compatible with SARS-CoV-2, Bonrui has found a bita-CoV-supply that indicates that bonrui may act as a part of the inter-supply, or that bintu-CoV-supply can contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions are coming from questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 has been deliberately created by accident.
Because of the recent tragedy of SARS-CoV-2, the CoVs have returned to the focus of the discussion.
The study of the CoV-suppression in animals and animals has quickly changed our view of the importance of animal rules in the human population.
Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERCS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have an extensive source of security and that they are insurmountable between people.
Since the SARS-CoV crisis is arising from human and Gorggokul's contact with the market, it could effectively cause the SARS continent to stop killing the Gorggokul's market.
With the same argument, the Pangolinbita-CoV2 closely related to SARS-CoV-2 should be removed from the Pangolin market in order to prevent animal disease from being detected in a number of species.
However, the Aadhu key and how the SARS-CoV-2 is bonru and other destructive animals are still to be clarified in the future.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in a muddy camel for a long time.
These camels also serve as the main source of meat, milk, skin and dust for local people, apart from the important transport tool.
They are spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to kill all camels for the control of MERCS, such as what was done in China's forest animal market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the spread of MRS again, the combination of viruses against MRS-CoV should provide an effective means of developing vaccines for camels in other conflict control systems.
If we are unable to eliminate these viruses, we may have a new type of gnotype.
Many types of animal coVs are actually spreading.
In particular, the Bat CoV is very strange with the possibility of an animal.
These joint CoVs are highly likely to be enlarged and reconnected, resulting in new CoVs that will be more communicable and/or fatal in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, Chinese wildlife should be left to eat in some places.
With the scrutiny of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better preparation and response plan.
Many viruses have prevailed on the earth for a very long time.
Until they have the opportunity to spread, they are naturally in their own natural state.
Although there are many features of the outbreaks that prevent the spread of the virus, it is possible to reduce the chance of people being exposed to the spread of the virus and other wildlife if people are warned to stay away from them.
In order to better understand the habitat of the coV and their natural shelters, it is necessary to have an indiscriminate look at the pets, which will be effective in preventing the animal's invasion and deterioration of the future.
In contrast, the most effective way to prevent animal disease among humans is to stay away from the environmental strains of the animal virus.
Several pieces of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First of all, if the outbreaks attack the SARS-CoV-2 parental virus in Bonrui, you will have to see what the situation is and how it can divide the same environmental bullet.
Secondly, it is important to determine how people should be affected by the outbreak if the outbreaks play a more direct role in the human crisis.
Third, if any third mammalian animal acts as a real medium dresser, it must be explained by how it interacts with different peoples with humans, frogs and penguins.
Finally, since many pets with pets may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and testing should be carried out.
If it is broken, Pangolin or any other mammalian animal, it is expected that the parent viruses associated with SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses will be identified in its natural diets in the future.
In this area, ongoing research will explain the changing path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19.
It is necessary to update the scale of COVID-19 to "invented" and "secure".
On February 6, 2020, our group Novell Kornaviras 2019 (2019-nCoV) issued a quick advice for the detection and treatment of the seizures and provided us with experience and made good reference to the fight against this epidemic worldwide.
However, because of the experience gained from ongoing research and clinical practice, Krona's virus design 2019 (COVID-19) is slowly increasing our awareness and knowledge; therefore, disease and medical techniques are being updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment on our instructions and have given the latest COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, according to the guidelines for the disease and medical treatment, the "questioned case" and the "certain case".
On December 2019, 2019, novell Krana virus (2019-nCoV) spread, officially called Krana virus design 2019 (COVID-19) and named the virus Civilian Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO COVID-19 marked as excessive.
To fight against the SARS-CoV-2 attack, our team has made a quick recommendation and it was published online on February 06, 2020.
Since its publication, it has been a huge response.
Remember, our awareness and knowledge of a new disease, ongoing research and clinical practice, is slowly increasing; therefore, disease and medical techniques are being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the Republic of China's Health Committee on Disease and Medicine (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published on 16 January 2020, published a total of seven versions, each of which has been substantially modified.
Now Zaw and his colleagues have made a comment about our direction, and they have proposed a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our direction and has also made valuable references to this continent worldwide.
We approve of their remarkable work and thank us.
Of course, the latest medical and medical guidance for COVID-19 and recent research also need to be updated.
According to the seventh version (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, two clinical precursors must be present with one of the epidemiological historical characteristics for a detailed analysis, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, then three clinical precursors must be filled.
Epidemiological History: (1) The city and its surrounding areas have a positive history or travel history, or other communities where the presence of COVID-19 cases has been reported in the last 14 days before the outbreak of the outbreaks; (2) A history of the outbreaks of SARS-COV-2 cases in which the outbreaks have been reported (researched by the New Aid); (3) The city or other communities in which the outbreaks have occurred in the areas of the city or surrounding areas, where the outbreaks have been reported in the last 14 days of the outbreaks of severe or respiratory diseases, or other communities in which the outbreaks of the outbreaks have been reported in 2 months prior to the outbreak of outbreaks of the outbreaks of COVID-19 diseases, and in the last 14 days of COVID–19 diseases (confirms of the institutions)
Clinical manifestations: (1) hot and/or breathable presupposes; (2) COVID-19 with imagery features; (3) Total white blood cell counts show normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte counts while standing at the start.
Based on the suspect case, for sure case determination, any pathogenic or serological evidence below should be: (1) SARS-COV-2 positive for real-time PCR testing; (2) positive for a fully-known gene sequential failure virus with high homogenicity or matching; (3) negative for a serum test of IgM-COV-2 positive for IgM-COV-2; or negative for SARS-COV-2-specific IgG Antibedy Negetive; and severe increase in Tiatar levels above ≥4.
We found that the second (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020) version included the actual time PCR tests and blood samples in the breath.
Blood samples were added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) version; then the serological evidence was added to the seventh version.
Based on the ongoing efforts of researchers, these changes help to find a suitable nucleic acid detection kit for rapid detection, which increases the risk of samples and helps to bring certain antibacterial positive results to a safe standard.
In addition, more evidence has been found, which reminds us of being alerted to our undiagnosed and undiagnosed patients.
Therefore, Zhou and his associates should be updated because they classified non-clinical subjects as "lowly dangerous".
The score system should also be checked for future clinical practices and studies.
As a pretext, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
In order to define "infected" and "certain diseases", we recommend marking them and following the latest directions in our countries.
Our team will update our instructions on time.

Portugal's parliament voted to increase its national emergency for 15 days; 215 votes against, 10 votes against and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia's holy city, Mecca and Madina, has continued to increase its carfus throughout the day; the previous carfus was only effective from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand was planning to implement the Carfu at 4:00 a.m. at night.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state has increased its order to live at home until May 1st.
Shops in Australia reduce the limit of toilet paper on land
On Sunday evening and Saturday evening, the Australian store chain Olwarts and collusive national stores have reduced the limit of two and one package of toilet paper per London store.
In addition, the ALDI starts a package limit on Monday.
These limits were posted to checkouts and to Xine's Facebook pages.
If people had to separate themselves, they thought that the Croats were enjoying the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths-o-home stores a package of toilet paper sales for home delivery.
These changes were followed by four packages that were properly launched by Ulhorths and Cols on 4th and 5th March.
"March 8th Cols announces that four-packet bans have been launched in different places, but "all is still sold within an hour of supply in some shops," they called it "absorbed" and Aldi described it as "unexpected" in a Facebook post this Tuesday."
According to Ulhorths, sales increased last week.
Costcor shop in Canberra was also allowed for two packages last week.
In order to reduce the impact, Koles ordered larger packages than the suppliers and increased the rate of return of supplies, Ulhorths ordered additional stocks, where ALDI generated stock revenues for a planned special Wednesday.
Australian Retailers Association executive Russell Jimmarman said that shoppers are trying to increase their risk of losing weight, but the local council's bans are hampered during the distribution of the truck.
With the efforts of suppliers to meet demand, he hopes to increase the cost of production.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after leaving the stock, some shops could not run special sales on Wednesday.
According to a news.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a sales expert at the Queensland University of Technology, says that shops fill their stores each.
He noted that a heavy item in the toilet paper is very low in the collection and that when all is sold, the huge amount of it is empty and strengthens the sense of loss.
"ABC News says "Coles and Woolworths, if he has a lot of things, and things like toilet roll and sanitizers [canoes], and it's enough, it's probably going to reduce this fear," said Russell Jimerman."
Recycled toilet paper producer Hu Givs and Crap said last Wednesday that their stock would end.
According to News.com.au report, Kimberly-Clark, who are making Klinex Toilet Tsou and Solaris Papers, strongly said they are working 24/7 to keep their supply.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some of the assets sold in Melbourne were giving the first bidder a free toilet paper, which was because of the fact that something was taken away by the Kretas had been released for a long week at work.
In Darwin's publication this Thursday of the printed NT News, a piece of paper is added to the page and is used as a toilet paper.
A report from the ABC Australia on March 3 said that shops were essentially najassed, where they said there was no plan to impose laws on their kanakat.
Russell Jimerman also says that other foods include masks, sanitizers, dry food, gloves and time.
Similarly, on Sunday evenings outside Australia, two 12-roll packs of paper sold for Andres Shews were limited to online British supermarkets in Ocado.
World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as excessive
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the disease caused by Kornaviras SARS-COV-2 was too much.
"If the word "Ameari" does not mean how dangerous the cases are, but does mean how much any disease has spread, however, the need for global health authorities to take action was mentioned: "
"All countries can still change the path of this global continent."
"WHO great Adam Gebraisas said if the kingdoms can mark them," "can check, treat, distinguish, identify and unite."
"We are deeply concerned about both the fearsome level of disease and the intensity of inactivity."
According to former director Dr. Tom Frieden of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the global continent "intangible"."
"In a comment published in CNN in February, he said, "except for Influenza, no time has been spent reading from the origin of any other respiratory virus in the world."
"Gebresas also makes the same point, "We've never seen a monster created by any coronaviras before."
"He was saying, "And we've never seen a global monster that can be controlled at the same time."
The new honour received as a global continent in January follows the WHO's decision to declare the phenomenon of international concern as a public emergency.
"The National Allergy and Crime Institute of the United States of America said about Dr. Anthony Faucy's theory, "The situation is getting worse."
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that at least 126,000 of the worldwide COVID-19 attacks resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
This 2019-20 does not exceed the virus virus virus 2019 (CVID-19), which is caused by the Civil Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The tragedy was identified in China in December 2019, which was declared a public emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and was recognised as a global nightmare on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, almost 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were seized in 210 countries and centralized areas, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have received relief.
The rate of death is estimated at 4% in the case, from 13.04% in Algeria worldwide to .08% in New Zealand.
The common sights include fire, cough, and breath.
Neumonia and Acute Respiratory Disorders may include syndrome.
It is usually five days from the date of the contact, but it may be from two to forty days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral therapy.
Primary treatment is pre-existing and supportive therapy, including hand washing, covering your face during the sun, keeping away from other people, and monitoring and separating for those who are suspected of being attacked.
Global authorities have reacted by stopping travel control, quarantine, carfu, risk control and facilitation.
The global continent has led to severe global economic breakdown, games, religious, political and cultural events have been abolished, and the loss of supply has increased due to fear.
Schools and universities are nationally and not locally closed in 193 countries, which have damaged nearly 99.4 percent of the world's population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and foreign and disparate events have occurred in China, East and South-East Asia, depending on the generation and appearance of the virus and the recent developments in other areas.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy art, emissions of air pollution and coal have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Uhan (the capital of Hubei) announced a cluster of harms in Neumonia, and a survey was launched in January 2020.
Most cases were connected to the Hollsell market in Huanan Sea Food, and therefore the virus is considered to be an animal source.
The virus is known as SARS-CoV-2 and is known to be a new virus closely related to SARS-COV, Bonrui, and SARS-COV. The first person to be identified as a precursor was reported to have become ill on December 1, 2019; and the next person to whom there was no visible connection with the Wet Market Cluster.
In December 2019, two-thirds of the primary cluster was found to be part of the market.
On 13 March 2020, a report from the South China Morning Post indicated that on 17 November 2019, a case was probably the first to find a source, which was among 55-year-olds from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, WHO announced that new incidents in China had been dropped consistently, but that it was gradually increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new events outside China had been printed for the first time inside China.
The number of infections may be reduced, especially for those with mild prejudice.
For the 26th of February, there has been a lack of information among young people, most of whom are under 19 years of age and 2.4% worldwide. The United Kingdom’s main scientific guide Patrick Valence estimated that 60 percent of the British population need to be infected before the disease-resistance capability is achieved.
According to the official protocol, the case means the number of people who have been tested with COVID-19 and whose results have been positive.
No country has tested more than 3% of its population by 23 March, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have established official rules to avoid testing those who are light.
A review published on 16 March revealed that almost 86% of the COVID-19 seizure in China could not be detected until January 23rd, and that the unrestricted incident was a source of 79% of the documented incident.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of seizures in Italy was significantly higher than the number of seizures in government accounts.
The average yield (R0) for COVID-19 was between 1.4 and 2.4.
A review published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it is probably 5.7.
Most people in COVID-19 have become better off.
In the case of those who do not, death ranges from 6 to 41 days since the rise of the paradisaic period, the most common of which is 14 days.
Nearly 97,000 deaths related to COVID-19 were reported on April 10, 2020.
In China, up to February 5, 80% of people died over 60 years of age and 75% of them had heart disease and diabetes before. The death statistics in COVID-19 usually refer to those affected by COVID.
As a result of COVID-19, the number of deaths may be much higher, since it may include all people who die without testing - such as home, nursing home, etc.
Some information from Italy has been found that the number of additional deaths in the past year has increased from 4 to 5 times the death rate of government COVID.
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC) admitted that "we know that [the number of deaths] is lower than the actual number", which was reported by a report that did not depend on the United States' data base.
The first death outside China's main continent was in the Philippines on 1st February and the first death outside Asia on 14th February in France.
Nearly a dozen deaths have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy since 28 February.
By 13 March, more than half of the earth's population and land have been reported dead except for Antarctica, and there are several ways to determine death.
These numbers vary from region to region, and the number of tests, health care options, medical options, time taken after primary birth, and population settings such as age, gender, and public health. The ratio of death and disability to one given time limit shows that the number of cases in which death occurred is divided by the number of cases in which it occurred.
Based on statistics from Jones Hopkins University, the ratio of death and death to cases worldwide is 10 April, 2020 by 6.0% (97.039/1,617,204).
The number of digits used to display the total number of digits displayed.
In China, the death rate and the rate of death rate of 17.3% (shown in January 1-10 of 2020) is less than 0.7% (shown in February 1st of 2020). Other antimicrobials include the death rate of the case (CFR), which represents the percentage of people who die from disease, and the rate of death (IFR) who are infected (defeated or incapacitated) by those who have died in a disease.
These statistics are not limited at any time and follow a specific population from the crisis through case analysis.
Many students have tried to count these numbers for a specific population.
The University of Oxford estimates that there are between 0.1% and 0.39% deaths in this conflict.
According to Germany, COVID-19's first allotment test and CFR estimates are consistent with a statistical study to analyze the impact of the test.
WHO claims that this excess can be controlled.
The maximum limit of the procope and the final time limit may vary according to uncertainty and location.
"Pen State University's Maccaise Boney said, "When going from under inspection, the rebel forces usually rule and then when the disease is no longer near the host, it begins to be a waste."
But it's almost impossible to complain about when it's going to happen right now.
"The Chinese government's chief medical advisor Zhang Nanshan argued that if all countries can be brought together to follow the advice of the World Health Organization in order to prevent the spread of the virus, "it may end in June."
"On March 17, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "would probably continue to spread for one or two years."
According to Neil Ferguson's research at the Imperial College, "until no ticks are available (probably 18 months or more)", physical distance and other steps are needed."
"Vanderbilt University William Chefner said, "I think it's very unlikely that this kornavirus -- because it's being attacked so fast -- will become completely invisible" and it can become "a deadly disease, come back every year."
The intensity of return will depend on the ability to prevent disease and the extent to which it is transmitted.
The findings of COVID-19 may be relatively vague and the offenders may be undetectable.
The two most common prefixes are heat (88%) and dry matter (68%).
Less widespread symptoms are expected: snorting, coughing, loss of breath, breathing problems, headaches, chills, vomiting, coffee, coughing, overdrinking, or cyanosis. WHO reports that about one in six people is seriously ill and suffers from breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the symptoms of depression, anxiety or pressure, sudden confusion, awakening and sneezing; these symptoms are recommended to help with medical care, which may be caused by more serious pneumonia, acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of those attacks may be asymptomatic without clinical prejudice, but the results of the investigation are certain, so researchers have recommended monitoring and testing of those who are in contact with those who are infected to avoid them.
The Chinese average unmarked ratio is from a few to 44%.
14 days from one day to five days from the time of the general incubation (infection) in the area, according to the example of uncertainty, the proportion of people who initially had a COVID-19 was 30% and the proportion of people who later had a lead was 15%.
How the disease spreads is still being identified.
It is thought that the disease is spread by a small droplet, which is caused by close contact time and coughing, coughing or talking; it is between 1 and 2 meters (3 and 6 feet) of close contact.
The survey showed that from an open casket, water can range from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe that the virus can be developed by a small wave that lasts for a long time in the air, while breathing reds can also occur when the virus is gone, even though it is not usually airtight.
The waters can either enter the face or nose of those nearby or enter through the air.
Some medical methods, such as Intubation and Cardiopelmonary Reconstitution (CPR), can lead to respiratory failure and can lead to respiratory failure.
It can spread even when someone touches any dirty surface with a tattoo and then touches their eyes, noses or faces.
Although this concern may spread through soil, this risk is considered to be less.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of an attack on SARS-CoV-2, the virus being the most aggressive in the first three days of being exposed, although it may be attacked before and after the outbreak.
Three days before these symptoms began, many people have found positive results in the test, which suggests that the disease may occur before any significant signs appear.
There are only a few reports of undetected cases, but some countries have detected undetected incidents during the search for communications.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not quite clear how it spreads easily, but one person usually attacks two or three people.
In particular, this virus can be found in plastics (polypropylene), 304 steinless steels, one day on the cardboard and four hours in Tama.
It's changed depending on heat and temperature, and it's been positively tested for COVID-19 and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can spread viruses among humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just how to touch the other surfaces of the infected people.
The deadly severe virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novell and abalone virus, which is the first to be separated from the three diseases associated with the severe respiratory disease group in Neumonia.
All the features of Novell SARS-COV-2 can be seen in the virus that is not actually related. The virus is killed outside the human body by the home savanna because it breaks the virus's protective opening.
It's supposed to be a source of animal disease.
The gene analysis revealed that Krana virus genetically with Jenas betacronavirus (Lines B) is intertwined with two strands found in subgenas serbecoviras.
The 96% level of complete gnomes in the Kornaviras Sample (BatCov RatG13) is one of the most common.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers observed in a study that there are only one amino acid in some parts of the GNOME Sequence virus in Bonrui.
To date, it has been compared to the whole of GNOME that there is a 92% similarity between the virus and the SARS-COV-2, which is not enough to prove that it worked as a host in the middle.
It is possible to temporarily cause viral infections, but finally confirm the reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or cit imagery of the infected Lalars.
A study comparing the PCR with the above CT proposed that CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, but less specific, and the many properties of taking images of it end up with other harmonics and diseases.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology suggested that "COVID-19 should not be used as a first-line test for the disease."
WHO issued a number of RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was launched on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, rRT-PCR.
The test can be carried out on breath or blood samples.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours.
This test is usually edited on a non-sopharyngeal soybean, but can also be used on a gallbladder soybean. Some laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect anthode.
On 6 April 2020, none of it proved to be accurate enough to allow for remote use.
In the United States of America, Chelex has been authorised to use only approved applications in emergency situations.
The typical features of taking images in the radiographic and computerized tomography (CT) of the people involved include the absence of the latest Peripheral Ground Glass opacity and plurality.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of photos from the examination of confirmed cases.
PCR has restricted the creation of images without confirmation and the identification of COVID-19 for mixing with other outbreaks such as Adenovirase.
A major review in China compared PCR with CT results and explained that, although the image of the attack is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive that recommends viewing it as a screening tool in the affected marine region.
The development of germinirv has been established by an organization that develops virus properties through radiograph and CT.
Preventing the spread of the disease includes maintaining public personal health, washing hands, and not touching eyes, nose or face, and touching or touching the tissue and throwing it into a garbage dump.
Those who may have already been attacked have been advised to remain on social masks.
Physical distance protection systems are also recommended to prevent conflict, and many governments have advised or controlled against all unnecessary voyages from countries and regions affected by disasters.
However, the virus has reached a level of public spread in most of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading into the public and some people in the public don't know where or how it was attacked, and that someone who can be attacked is advised to use the health care of the service providers, the protection of contact and the protection of the eyes, and it is very important to identify a source of conflict and to identify other people who are in contact with the health authorities who are seeking to prevent it.
The administration has been concerned about the privacy situation of mobile phones for this purpose, and the Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have called for this kind of surveillance to be limited.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for use, and by April 7, 2020, more than one group of experts is working on an adequate solution to privacy issues, such as the use of Bluetooth to login to other users' mobile phones.
Then users will get a message if they come to contact someone with a COVID-19 positive. Some misconceptions about how to prevent this conflict are around.
COVID-19 has no prints, although many organizations are working to create one.
Hand dust was advised to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people sometimes wash their hands with soap and water for at least a second, especially after going to the shed or when the hands are not visible; before eating; before kissing, during kissing, or when shaking.
Because outside of the human body, the virus can be killed with soap, which destroys the virus's protective bud.
The CDC recommends that at least 60% of alcoholic Sanitizers can be used instead when soap and water are not available.
WHO has advised people not to touch their eyes, noses or faces with their bare hands.
The surface can be released with a few speeds (for the surface of the stone steel in a minute of contact with the animal), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as Bengalconium chloride and Clohexidin Gluconet, are less comparable.
CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an office or de Cairo, the electronic tools to be used in sharing, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote control and ATM machines should be used by sick people.
Health organizations recommend that people should tear their face and nose or cover with tissue and then discard it properly during coughing or coughing.
It is recommended that those who are afraid of being infected should be able to control the size of the fires and the extent of the spread of fires when they speak, when they touch or touch.
WHO has issued a directive on when and how they should be.
According to Professor Stephen Griffin of Lids University, "the mask can reduce the tendency to touch people's faces, which is a major source of attack without proper hand clearance." The mask is also recommended for those who may be affected by the disease."
WHO has only advised healthy people to wear masks if they are at high risk, such as those who are serving a man with a COVID-19 infection, even if they admit that it can help to avoid touching people's faces if they remain behind masks.
Several countries have started encouraging the public to use Facebook masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical mask on the face of a CDC. China specifically recommends the use of an inaccessible medical mask for healthy people, especially when others are close to (1 m (3 m) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended a social mask during travel or in popular places.
Health officials in Thailand are encouraging people to make facial masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are not allowed to cover masks or noses and faces when they go outside.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to follow a face mask while going to popular places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that each Mudi shop should read a face mask.
Israelis have asked for masks whenever they go outside.
Taiwan, who produce nearly ten million masks every day in mid-March, requires masks on their way to trains and international travels on April 1st.
Every time Panama goes out, masks have been forced and advised to wear masks in home for those who can't buy masks.
Japanese, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore are also widely used as facial masks.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes reducing close contact between individuals and controlling the extent of the disease.
Methods include: being a Quarantine; limiting travel; closing schools, workshops, stadiums, theatres or shops.
People can use social distance approaches from home, travel restrictions, avoid popular areas without touching them, and physically keep away from each other.
Many governments are now imposing or recommending social exclusion in areas affected by the disease.
From the US government authorities and health institutions' advice, the maximum rate of compliance is 250 people (unless COVID-19 is spread in the area) 50 people and 10 people will be taken in the future.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people in public: the elderly people and the elderly, diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and the disease prevention capabilities of the affected medical system, such as WHO and other health-care institutions, were in danger of serious health problems and complications, and the CDC advised them to stay as much as possible in the areas of society.
The use of the word "social distension" (social distance) has been such that instead of encouraging other people to keep in touch with others, it has led to total social disparagement, some authorities have pointed out that sexual health should be used over time."
It included the advice to get involved with someone who lives with you who does not have this virus or who does not have any connection with the virus.
Self-reliance was recommended at home for those suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
Health agencies are calling for self-isolation, and many governments are forcing or recommending self-quantin to all residents of affected areas.
The most severe instructions for self-quantining have been issued to high-risk groups.
People affected by human contact in COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region have been advised to stay in quarantine for 14 days from the last possible contact.
Designs for controlling nature are entertainment or oppression and nuisance.
The primary stages of torture are controlled, and the aim of other crime control is to find and separate people who are infected to stop the disease from spreading the disease.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are being made at an appropriate level: some responses are taken to reduce the rate of the disease and reduce its impact on health care and society.
At the same time, Containment (containment) and Metigation can both accept a mixed standard.
In the case of oppression, more measures must be taken to reduce the number of primary generations and to reverse the cycle of obesity.
It reduces risks to health and gives more time for commenting and treatment to improve.
Other ways to control the nature of the drug include personal contraceptives, such as hand clean health, face masks, and quarantine; public measures such as stopping school and canceling community events; other ways to recognise and participate in it; and environmental measures such as cleaning the surface; after the intensity of the phenomenon is evident, more severe measures have been taken to suppress the violence in China, such as bribery and forced overcrowding.
Other countries have taken more than one goal to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea reported public inspection and local quarantine, and warned of the pace of the attack.
Singapore has provided financial assistance to those who have made their own quarantines and have charged large sums of money to those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased its facial mask and increased its criminality in the supply of medicine. Great Britain and the United States have seen a major challenge of acceptance (suppressed but not prevented) and oppression (in the face of the plague).
While health policies can reduce health requirements by 2/3 parts per day and half of death, health systems are still rising to several million as a result of death.
There may be ways of getting depressed, but it is necessary to keep the virus alive as long as the virus remains in the human population (or if it comes first) until it is available, because the virus attacks are coming back quickly.
Long-term action to suppress the plague has caused social and economic damage.
No antiviral medicinal products are allowed for COVID-19, but the existing medicinal products are being tested for development.
Over the counter's drug service, fluids, and rest may be the basis for the paraphernalia.
Depending on how serious the disease depends on it, oxygen therapy, intravenus (through the head) may require fluid and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can be worse.
More than one age for treatment of other viral diseases has been researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO further states that some "scared and domestic resistance" has helped to undermine the observations seen by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO has described increased capacity and health care as an antidote to the disease's early detection.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Hospitals and Primary Medical Services has indicated that many sources will be removed, including increased monitoring of COVID-19 testing, the separation and maintenance of COVID-19 positive patients, and increased monitoring of workers and available ventilation and rest, among others.
Where the first case (the so-called patient Ziro) might be located, there are different theories.
Novel Don't find the first case of the virus in Hubei, China, on December 1, 2019.
Over a month, the number of cases in Kornaviras in Hubei was gradually increased.
Most of these were related to the Cuban marine food market, where live animals were sold, and according to one theory, the virus came from some kind of animal; or, in other words, its source of food. On December 26, a novelty cluster of unknown causes was observed and Dr. Zhang Jixian (Zhang Jixian) treated it at the Provincial Hospital, which informed Owen Jianghan CDC.
"On December 30, he warned a group of central hospital doctors about a "SARS-Do Not Look Virus" of their employees."
Along with Lee Wenlyang, eight of these doctors were harassed by the police to spread lies, and another doctor urged his senior workers to expose the danger.
He then published a public notice on December 31st and announced to the World Health Organization.
A number of unknown cases of Neumonia have been brought to the fore in January, almost twice every seven days at the initial stage of the procepsis.
By the first and mid-term of 2020, the virus has spread to other areas of China as a result of China's New Year's migration and the fact that it is a hub of transport and the main railway fleet.
On January 20, China states that nearly 140 new cases have been found on one day, two of which are Bejing and a Shenzeen.
The following government data show that there have already been signs in 6174 by 20 January 2020. By 26 March the United States of China and Italy has seen the world's most reliable events, with over 1.61 million cases reported worldwide; 9 April 2020 more than 97,000 people have died and 364,000 people have been healed.
There was at least 200 incidents in the country and region.
In Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restrict free movement and restrict border control.
National responses include some form of repression, such as the separation of individuals (known as the Order or the Lockdown to take refuge in the home or somewhere) and Carfew. By April 2nd, nearly 300 million people or 90% of the population are in some sort of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 million people in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some sort of lockdown, which grew two days later to 2.6 billion -- almost one third of the world's population.
On December 1, 2019, the first certified case of COVID-19 was found; but according to an uncertain report, the first case was found on November 17th.
Dr. Zhang Zjian pointed to an unknown cluster in Neumonia on December 26, which announced his hospital on December 27 to the Uhan Jianghan CDC.
The initial genetic test of the samples of the patient on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of coronaviras as a SARS.
On December 31, he published a public announcement by the Health Commission.
WHO was reported the same day.
"After these announcements were published, the police warned about the "dissemination of speech" of the nature of Uhan's doctors."
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human intervention."
"At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a controversial campaign that was later described as "the "war of people" by the Chinese Communist Party to control the scope of the Shi Jinping Virus."
"Come on and stop going there on January 23rd, a cordon senator was announced, described as "the greatest quarantine in human history" which extended to every 15 cities in Hobei and affected nearly 57 million people."
There was a ban on the use of private transport in the city.
China's New Year's (January 25th) festival has been canceled in various places.
Owners also announced the establishment of a temporary hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was established to take care of the additional patients after the Leicensation Hospital.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, 14 other hospitals, such as the Chinese Convention Center and the stadium, became temporary hospitals.

On-line, the content of the Kornaviras theme has been spread over the Internet, which is very funny and can be seen from this uncertainty.
Since the tragedy of COVID-19, prejudice has also been seen against people of China and East Asian tribes, and against people of Europe, the United States and other countries in the hotspot region, regardless of fear of foreigners and racism.
In many countries, especially Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific areas, there have been cases of fear, doubt and hostility.
The February case reports worldwide show that China’s people have been misinformed about various groups of people, where they are eligible for this virus or what they are being treated with as a fair reward.

Respiratory Kornavir disease 2019 (CVID-19) and laboratory testing for the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that identify the presence of the virus and identify the antibodies to the reaction.
Samples confirm virus presence by RT-PCR, which detects kornaviras RNA.
The test is specific and only designed to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This is used to confirm a very recent or active conflict.
Both disease and public surveillance can be used for the detection of antibiotics.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including people who were very valuable for reporting prejudices or who were unaccompanied.
The results of this test can be determined by a correct death rate and by the group's ability to prevent the disease.
Due to limited testing, there was no reliable data on viral disease in their population until March 2020.
No country has tested more than 3% of its population by 23 March, and there is a huge balance in how many countries have been tested.
This difference may have a significant impact on the death rate in the reported case, which is likely to be significantly more likely in some countries.
According to the National Soyab or Thutur sample, the samples of the soybeans can be tested using various methods of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
In general, results can be obtained within 2 days from a few hours.
The RT-PCR test that was edited with Galler Soyab is only reliable for the first week of the disease.
The virus may become invisible from the throat in the future, but the number of fumes may increase.
In the case of people who have been attacked for the second week, otherwise a sample may be taken from the depth of the breathing catheter, or a sample may be used with the catheter.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in Berlin's Charité in January 2020, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it built 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech created a clinical-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It is the first company in China to have been authorised to use a PCR-CoV-2 detection kit from the National Medical Products Administration of China. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the first company in the United States to have been authorised to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.
Three versions of the old test kits produced unbalanced results in one genetic test, and a test ban in the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in less than 100 samples successful throughout February 2020.
Tests using two elements were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020 and were not allowed to start testing by states and local laboratories until then.
The Food and Drug Administration (Food and Drug Administration) test was approved under an emergency authorisation. The U.S. Business Labs began testing in a collection of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the usefulness of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also provided COVID-19 country-wide tests on March 9, 2020.

The study of COVID-19 in Russia prepared and produced State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic COVID-19 obtained a report that had been prepared to detect a seizure. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that would be edited more than 3.5 hours, thus allowing a machine to check approximately 4,128 over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA Abbott Laboratories granted emergency use authorisation (USA) for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; previously approved the FDA as Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received a similar test from the US from the FDA, which takes about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test using isothermal nuclear acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since there is no need for a periodic temperature cycle, this method can produce positive results in less than five minutes and can produce negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are nearly 18,000 U.S. devices and Abbott is hoping to increase the production of 50,000 tests per day, using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically bound to the N protein of the new Kornavirus, and this test is being prepared in Taiwan within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid influenza test.
"A literature review of March 2020 suggested that "the importance of Book Radiographics in primary stages is very low, but the information from CT [Computated tomography] can be present before the pre-notification."
The CT settings include a bilateral, multilobar background-glass opacificity, which includes a border, an infinite and backward distribution.
With the success of the disease, there are sub-pleural domains, crisis paging and consularization.
A study comparing the PCR with the current source of the present overseas has proposed that CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, but less specific, and the many properties of taking images of it end up with other harmonica and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used as a first-line test for the selection of "COVID-19"".
IgM and IgG are part of an anti-inflammatory reaction.
Assessments can be carried out in central laboratories and service areas (point-of-care testing, Poct) to detect human infections, to determine the ability to prevent disease, and to monitor people.
High-performance automatic systems in many non-essential laboratories will be able to edit this ash, but will depend on the efficiency of each production system.
A single border blood sample is usually used for CLTs, although serial samples may also be used to monitor the anti-inflammatory reactions.
A blood sample is usually taken to break the blood to POC.
There is no need to take action before testing the P.C.R. method. On 26 March, 2020, F.C. 29 has announced the names of organizations that have provided the agency with the notification as required and are now able to distribute their antibiotic tests.
By 7 April 2020, FDA has only approved one test under an emergency authorisation. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics had obtained European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in the blood sample.
The test power is a few hundred samples in a few hours, which is why it is much faster than the virtual RNA's traditional PCR assessment.
In April, the United Kingdom found that they did not have the right to use an antibiotic kit.
"Hong Kong has created a plan where suspect patients can live at home, "will soon give the patient a sample tube," he will blow it up, send it back and get the results of the test. British NHS has announced that they are launching a plan to test suspicious events at home, which, if the patient is at any hospital, will remove the risk of being infected by the patient, or if it is using ambulence, will remove it from the vitality of the patient.
The drive-thru centers have helped South Korea to test the fastest, most widespread, in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Helth Insierence Fictionians said on March 2 that they have the ability to check almost 12,000 every day in their traveling settings and that 10,700 people were tested last week.
When the test is under the direction of a doctor, health insurance costs are borne.
According to the president of the Robert Cos Institute, Germany has the official capacity to test 160,000 per week.
On March 19, many were tested in the big city.
The total number of tests completed in Germany was unknown on 26 March 2020, because only positive events are reported.
"A first lab review revealed that at least 483,295 samples were tested by 12/20 calendar weeks, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers "Technion and Rambam Hospital" (Chinese, or "Augun 2000" were tested together to test samples from 64 patients, and only if the combined sample was found positive.
B.G.I.'s founder Wang Xian's monitoring of the construction and its 5-day modeling showed that, if this test could not increase in time, the events in Hubei would have been 47% more and the quarantine conflict would have doubled.
China, like Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, has quickly followed the Hua-Yan Labs in 12 cities.
A total of 50,000 tests were available every day on 4 March 2020. Origami Assays published open source (multiplexed) maps that can only be tested by using 93 tests using COVID19 for a maximum of 1122 patients. These balanced designs can be run into a small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid handling.
In March, the lack of regents and insufficient numbers of European Unions and the United Kingdom and the United States became a barrier to public scrutiny.
As a result of this, some researchers discovered a sample preparation protocol in which samples were heated for 98 °C (208 °F) for further testing by the N.N.A.N.G. samples for 5 minutes. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now testing for more people for viruses and that the number of tests to reach most of the population is increasing.
"It's Drive-Tru's capability, and it was done through the generation of a number-scale production laboratory by Group 42 and BGI (China based on their "Huo-Yan" necessary detection laboratories)."
The lab built in 14 days is able to perform more than ten thousand RT-PCR tests every day and the world's first new lab operating outside China.
In China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, the genetic profile of Cornaviras was developed in various test methods.
The German production system adopted the World Health Organization.
The German system was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control (United States Centers for Disease Control) was not available until 28 January, which extended the tests available to the U.S. and was unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the needs of these countries and Australia and to test health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of viruses.
The South Korean administration has been able to test the field labs for several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization COVID-19 called for the best way to slow down the progress of the overfishing process, and further tests were carried out in the US labs due to extensive virus attacks, and pressure was exerted on soybean and chemical dealers.
In March 2020, China reported problems in its testing kits on neutrality.
"The test kits prepared by the U.S. CDC were "mistakes" and then the administration removed the ambulatory barriers that were blocked by the test, but saw that the results were wrong."
The organisation explained that it might result in a failure to collect the wrong results or to use the tickets correctly.
The Spanish minister said that they would reverse the wrong result kits, and replace them with a different one from the Shenzhen Bioeasy kit. The Czech Republic bought the test kits from China produced 80% of the wrong result. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found wrong.
"Principal Minister Matović suggested that they should be thrown into the Danube. Ates Kara, Turkish Minister of Health, said that the test kits purchased from Turkish China were "high-end error" and they "did not use them." The test kit purchased 3.5 million from China but announced that they were not usable in the first place in April 2020."
Testing and then quantifying those who found positive results and finding out who had been contacted with SARS-CoV-2 positive people resulted in positive results.
In Italy, the first place of death in COVID-19 was tested twice over the total population of 3,400 people in the city of Voo, Italy.
There were almost half of the people who had received positive results and all the people who were identified had been placed in quarantine.
New attacks have been completely removed as a result of controlling the traffic in the Commune.
The search for people in contact, through internal travel control, quarantine and separation, but with no strong control over restaurants and retail outlets, in Singapore 2020, Kannaviras has moved far beyond other developed countries in the world.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened on 23 March after the holiday break.
Many other countries have also found people in contact aggressively, through internal travel control, testing and sequentialization, but have controlled the global continent with less aggressive lockdown, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistics study found that the countries that tested death rates for more than the number of deaths are very low, as these countries may have been able to identify patients with little or no signs of death.
WHO recommends that the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples should be sent to one of the 16 reference laboratories in WHO to verify the verification of the sample.
The 16 reference laboratories include 7th in Asia, 5th in Europe, 2nd in Africa, 1st in North America and 1st in Australia.
The column "How many percentages of "tests" are positive" is influenced by the country's testing policy."
In a country where only people are tested in hospital, the positive % of the test will be more than the country where everything else is the same, whether or not all citizens will be tested.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as handwashing, means cleaning people’s hands to remove dust, grays, anesthetological living or other waste materials.
"In "the "significant moments of the day"" the regular washing of hands with soap prevents many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which cross the path of the mouth."
People may also be affected by breathing diseases, such as influenza or normal coldness, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching the eye, nose or face (i.e., snorkeling).
The five important moments of the day when you wash your hands with soap are: before and after the meal, after cleaning the children's basement or changing their hands, before eating the baby, before eating and cooking or cooking, before and after giving the fish, or after giving the chicken.
If water and soap are not found, hands can be cleaned with sand. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before cooking, before and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing the slide, or after cleaning the child's toilet.
After your nose, neck or arm.
After touching the animal, the animal's food, or the animal's stock.
Health care of the hand means the health habit of the treatment.
Wash hands before taking medicine or medicine, prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to keep your hands clean from chemicals that can cause disease (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms).
This is especially important for people who view or work on food in the field of medicine, but it is also an important method for ordinary people.
Many handwashing have health benefits, including reducing infections of influenza, convulsions and other infectious diseases; preventing diuretic causes; reducing pain;
And losing the child's death rate at home during the funeral.
A 2013 survey showed that hand washing habits can lead to a slight increase in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the rate of death of children associated with respiratory and diarrhea-related diseases can be reduced by easy-to-washing hands with Saban.
This common process can reduce the rate of death by almost 50%.
The fostering hand washing system can reduce almost a third of the Diary's mountain, and it will be compared to clean water supply in the small area of income.
Diarrhoea with handwashing with Saban is related to a decrease of 48%. Diary and severe pain prevention (ARI) is the only effective and effective way to prevent handwashing around the world as an automatic habit in homes, schools and communities.
Neumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
About 3.5 million children die a year because of Daria and Neumonia.
According to UNICEF, before eating and after using the toilet, any handwashing habit can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reduce death by almost half in the diet, and reduce death by one quarter from severe breathing disorders.
As part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs, hand washing is combined with other sanitation systems.
The hand-washed attacker protects against Impatega, which is attacked through direct physical contact.
A slight damaging effect of hand washing is a heavy hand washing effect that can cause rapid drying.
A Danish study in 2012 found that additional hands may lead to a spleen of skin, which is known as hand accommodation or hand disease, which is especially common among health workers.
Too thick a hand wash also appears as a prerequisite for obsessive-compulsive disorder, OCD.
The five important times during which the disease is reduced are: after using the bathroom, after cleaning or changing the baby’s undergarments, before eating, and before preparing or cooking, after using the bath, after washing the baby or changing the baby’s undergarments.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be used to prevent disease are included before and after cutting or damage treatment; after coughing, coughing, or nailing; after touching the animal or after rubbing the animal; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is very low.
In 2015, a survey of handwashing was conducted in 54 countries, with 38.7% of the family using soap and handwashing. A survey in 2014 showed that 97 percent of Saudi Arabia was the highest; in the United States, around 77 percent; and in China, 23 percent were the lowest; and in addition to the practice of handwashing in soap and handwashing in the times of the crisis, there are now several ways to increase the habit of handwashing.
"Essential Health Care Program" is an example of the implementation by the Education Department of the Philippines of "Essential Health Care Program" for children's health and education."
The main theme of this national program is to dry twice a year, wash your hands with soap every day, brush your teeth with fluoride every day.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The addition of soap or detergent to water increases the risk of an acute deterioration of the life of the anesthesiologists.
The main task of the Saban and the detergent is to reduce the obstacles to the emergency and to increase the emergency.
Only an inefficient water cleaner (Skin Klinjar) because blood and protein, which is part of the living earth, are not easily hardened into water.
Cleanup is certainly a means of water flow.
nate Saban, due to the type to be reused, can hold back the bacteria from previous use.
A small number of studies aimed at the movement of bacteria from the contaminated hard savanna led to a decision that the possibility of movement was reduced because bacteria were washed with phen.
"CDC still says "it's desirable to use a rope that can be controlled without using hands."
Health awareness about antibacterial Saban has been widely disseminated to the public.
There is no evidence to support the use of antibiotics or antibiotics recommended for antibiotics.
However, there are common antibacterial elements, such as triklosan, in the antibacterial Saban, which have the potential to prevent the organism to a greater extent.
Therefore, the antibiotic resistance strands may not be selected for antibacterial soap, but may be as effective as they are used.
As a pH controller, acid (ascetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active Benzoic acid and additional skin condiers (Aloversa, vitamins, menthols, strains) can also be present. The University of Oregon School of Public Health has reported a comprehensive analysis of the antimicrobial system used to remove bacteria from the hand.
Self-contained hot water is not hot enough to wash your hands.
The temperature of bacteria (37 °C) increases very rapidly.
But the natural oil that holds the soil and bacteria is more effective than hot soap, cool soap water.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that the use of hot water has no effect on the reduction of microbial burden.
A hand-sanitizer or hand-antiseptic element that is not water-based.
By the end of the 1990s, and by the end of the 21st century, non-water-based hand-cleaning elements of alcohol-based rabbi (Alcohol-based rab, antiseptic hand rab, or hand sanitizer) began to become popular.
The effects of using ease and drying of alcohol are most of them based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol based on the use of carbomers (polymers of acyclic acid) or humactans, such as in clays or in the form of solids such as glycerin.
The mixed hydrogen peroxide adds to the antimicrobial activity, which has a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol in the hands sanitizer, which is capable of killing animals.
The alcoholic Rab sanitizers killed bacteria, multiple medicines (MRSA and VRE), jaxma and some viruses (including HIV, Harps, RSV, Rinovirus, Vaccine, Influenza and Hepatitis) and mammals.
Alcohol Rab Sanitizer contains 70% of alcohol that kills 99.97% (3.5 Log Reduction, 35 DS) after 30 seconds of use and kills 99.999% (4 to 5 Log Reduction) after 1 minute of use and has killed bacteria. Hand Sanitizers are all active against bacteria and are less active against a few viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinals because they are almost completely ineffective against the type of neuroviral (or Norwegian) virus.
As long as the barrels, fams or jails are not dry, both fronts and backs and backs and the final edges have been struck for almost 30 seconds.
The fingertips should also be washed with two hands, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that hands should be washed well, especially when hands have been washed.
The increased use of these elements depends on the efficiency of their use and the rapid destruction of life; they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand dust, even if the soap and water are not inexhaustible.
If the formula is not connected to the emoleent and/or to the tablewasher, alcohol-based hand sanitizers may be the cause of excessive use of the table.
The formula can be reduced or removed by adding glycerol and/or other lotions to the formula.
In medical tests, soft-based alcohol-based hand-sanitizers were significantly less stimulated and dried than Saban or bio-nutrient.
Allergy-related diseases, contact with Dad or alcohol or alcohol have been very low in sensitivity to alcohol use.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, the lower tendency to report a painfully affected dramatitis has become an attraction.
Despite their performance, water-free elements do not clean the living things of the hands, but only feed the hands.
Because of the fact that the disease is being eliminated, many diseases are not as effective as soap and water, such as effective hand sanitizers.
Alcohol-free hands sanitizers rely more on the elements and preparation and have significantly less work than alcohol and alcohol Rab in the past.
More recently, antimicrobial activity has appeared to be stable and increased after the preparation of bengalconium chloride, which is not like alcohol, which is likely to decrease after repeated use due to progressive anticoagulant reactions.
In low-income societies, many people do not have financial harmony and instead use tea or soil.
Only the tea or soil can be more effective than water, but the soap can be less effective than soap.
A concern is that if soil or cheese is contaminated by an inanimate, it can increase the disease's range instead of reducing it.
A vital element like the Saban is that it creates a sharp rush in water contact.
If Saban is not found, the WHO recommends it as an alternative to Saban.
The following steps are included in the proper hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centres for Disease Prevention:
It's hot or cold water.
Water is recommended because permanent swimming pools may be contaminated, but water temperature does not appear to make any difference.
Put the soap in the back of your hand, between your fingers and under your nose.
The study showed that people wash their hands better when using soap instead of water.
At least take 20 seconds.
Scrubbing takes time, which removes the animal from its body and for a long time removes the animal from its body.
Take a good bath in the water.
In the pool, hands can be dirty again.
Drain with a clean towel or let the air dry.
The hands of Veza and Ardar are more easily contaminated. The places where the most neglected are the places of finger, fist, finger and nose.
Carmine and fat can protect the Neal Police.
To keep your hands dry is often advised by the machining lotion, which can cause damage to the dry rate that could increase the risk of the outbreak.
"In a developing country, where tap water is not available and/or soap can be used to provide a variety of small costs for hand washing, such as water-swimming jars or suitable water-swimmings and/or needed. In limited water supply (e.g. in schools of developing countries or rural areas), there are options for water-saving solutions such as "Tip-Tape" and other small costs."
Tippi-tap is a simple technology in which a foot-and-mouthed liver and a piece of soap are used to wrap water into a rock.
A unique member of the hand-drying process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in the public atmosphere.
The increasing amount of research indicates that the paper towel is much more healthy than the economic hand drawers in many areas.
In 2008 a study was conducted by the Westminster University of London in order to compare the health rates of Paper Towell, the hot-water hand Drier and the more modern jet-air hand Drier.
After washing hands and using a hot air drain, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% in the fingers and 254% in the hands.
The drying of jet air leads to an increase of 42% in the total number of bacteria in the fingers and 15% in the hands.
After washing hands with paper towels, the total bacteria decreased by 76% in the fingers and to 77% in the palm of the hands. As a result of the drying process, other users and users of washrooms tested whether there was a possibility of spread (cross-containment) pollution.
Jet-air Draer, who was able to blow out the air at speeds of 180 m/second (650 km/h; 400 km/h), was able to blow out of the hand and unit and remove possible pollution from the environment to 2 metres.
The use of a hot-air hand drawer spreads the observational life from the drain to 0.25 meters away.
Paper Towell Micro-Organism did not show any significant extent. In 2005, the TÜV product und Umwelt (TÜV Product und Umwelt) was evaluated for drying various hands.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after shaking hands:
Many different types of hand drawers are available and hand drawers are compared to paper towels.
An option to wash your hands with soap and water while travelling.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain at least 60% of alcohol.

After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water call (and open another door to get out of need).
It can prevent the hand from being contaminated again.
"The purpose of hand washing in the health environment is to remove and avoid disease-producing diseases ("life")."
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that most of the treatment was at an unacceptable level of handwashing, many doctors and nurses forgot about handwashing on a regular basis before they touched the patients, resulting in a life-threatening attack.
A study showed that proper hand-to-hand and other simple methods could reduce the rate of blood flow in catheter-related seizures of 66 percent, while the World Health Organization published standard hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-hit-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-hand-to-hand-hand-to-hand-to-hand-to-hand-hit-to-to-hand-hand-to-hand-to-hand-hi-to-hi-to-hi-hi-hi-hi-to-hi-to-to-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-to-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-to-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-l-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- low- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far-to- far- far- far- far- from-- far-to- from--- far- far- far- from- far-de- from- from- far- from- far- far- low- low-- from- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- off- off- far- from being- off- off- far- far- far- far- far- far- far- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off-- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- from- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off-- off- off- off- off- off from from from from from from from from- off- off- off-- off- off from- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off from- off- off- off- off- off--- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off--- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off from from from from from from from from from from- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off- off from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from Global- off- off- off- off- off from from from from Global- off- off- off- off from from from from from Global- off from Global- off from Global- off from Global- off from Global- off from from from from Global- off from Global- off from Global- off from from from Global- off from from from Global- off from from Global- off from Global in- off from Global- off from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from Global- off from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from-------------------------- from from from from from from from from from from----- list-------------------------------------------------------------- off-- list- list--- members- list- list--------------- off--- off------------ off------------------------ members----------------------------- members--------------------------------------------------------------- off----------------- members or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or

"After taking care of the disease, the Saban allows antiseptic chemical additions ("Avian" or "antimicrobial") to destroy the hand dust element."
Prior to surgery or in places where antibiotics-antibodies are present, there may be a lack of action. A call for hand-to-hand to "screw" is necessary to prevent and prevent hand-to-hand contact, some chlorhexidin or iodine-tooth dusting systems, live-to-screwing towels, and brushing and other live-to-screw cleaning machines.

In order to control the seizure of staphylococcal, it has been shown that the maximum benefit of hand-to-hand was the first 20% of the dust and when the hand-to-hand recovery was increased to 35%, additional benefits were very limited.
In the middle of 30 seconds, bacteria have been treated with soap compared to regular soap with three times as a result of dust on the food. In the middle of 30 seconds, bacteria have been treated with soap by hand-to-hand washing compared to hand-to-hand washing, showing that hand-to-hand exposure to alcohol was 26% lower than that of antibacterial soap.
From hand to hand, however, H1N1 Influenza is more effective in reducing the virus and the Clastridium Defissile beeswax than the alcohol-based hand rabbi and water/water. To improve the health of the hand in health, the teaching and the work of workers on the ease of the alcohol-based hand rabbi can be linked to the written and basic questions.
Some of them require more research on the most effective health environments.
In developing countries, hand-to-hand washing is recognized as a healthy, indispensable way to achieve even good well-being.
However, the lack of water supplies, soap or hand-washing is a challenge for people at home, in schools and in the workplace.
For example, in most parts of Africa, there is little room for handwashing, although there are options to make room for handwashing in most areas of Africa, but there are very few private or public toilets near handwashing.
However, a low rate of dusting may be due to a deep-like habit instead of soap or water/water.
Savannah can influence the policy of hand-washing and advice, raise awareness about hand-washing benefits, and lead to long-term change in people's habits.
This requires monitoring and evaluation in order to work effectively.
"70 reviews show that community-based methods in LMIC are effective in the field of hand-washing, while social media are less effective. An example of the campaign on hand-washing in schools is the "Third Star Apros" of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take easy, practical steps to ensure the health of their students in other areas of health."
If you achieve a minimum level, schools can reach between one and three.
The hand dust station is used to reduce the risk of hand dust loss and death that hand dust can be a part of helping it.
Another example of the World Hand Dust Day awareness campaign that is attempting to change the habit is that, as a result of the overtime, UNICEF announced its recognition of hand dust motions by Karnaviras 2019-20.
DALYs have considered several studies on hand-to-hand cleaning in developing countries.
However, one review shows that the spread of hand-to-hand washing with soap is more than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in unprotected situations, such as mothers in the hospital who gave birth to all children or injured soldiers – acknowledged it between the first 19th century: Hungarian Medical Ignaz Samuelways, who worked in Austria's neighborhood and Florence Nightingale, English "The Institute of Modern Narsing."
Until then, most people believed that the attack was caused by the bad smell of Miasmas.
In the 1980s, the U.S. attacks on food disease and health care led to more active use of hand health as an important way to prevent attacks and prevent them.
In 2009, the nature of the Soviet flu and in 2020, COVID-19 has increased awareness of the importance of hand washing in many countries to protect themselves from this type of infectious disease.
"For example, in Germany, the poster's public halls and the office's building and the airport's hand shed were held in front of the sink."
"This is the phrase "to cut off the hands of the merchant" means to pay the price of the person to be part of the labor."
Its source from Matthew’s Bible was Pontius Pilate’s decision to defend Jesus Christ from the crusades, but it has become more widely used among some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s MacBeeth, Lady McBeeth, who committed a crime and introduced her husband to crime, he began to wash his hands in an attempt to expose his criminal sense.

After the Soviet regime was adopted, Hindus, Jews and Islam were forced to wash their hands.
And, before and after each meal, hand washing is mandatory in Hindu religion, Buddhist religion, education, Jewish religion and Islam.
Job risk control for COVID-19
Business Risk Controls for COVID-19 include the use of professional safety and health methods to prevent COVID-19 from preventing COVID disease 2019 (COVID-19).
On the basis of a risk assessment of the sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the fear of the invasion of COVID-19, depending on the place of work and activity.
According to the U.S. Professional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk activities in contact with people and other employees have the lowest level of professional contact for which general measures to prevent conflict, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, teaching the breathing, and regularly cleaning and feeding the working environment.
Among the most dangerous jobs in contact are those where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but there is a need for close or close contact with people who are exposed to public health problems or who are likely to suffer from international travel.
It includes those who are in contact with the public, such as in school, in the context of high-profile work, and in the context of some growing rituals.
In addition to the primary prevention system, it includes the provision of personal protective equipment through improved air filters for the group's emergency control systems, including windmills, snowguards, and COVID-19.
H.S.A. believes that there is a risk of contact with people who are infected with COVID-19 or who are suspected of working in health and well-being, and that there is an increased risk if these workers are using an aerosol-producing process or are collecting samples of COVID-19 or samples of persons who are suspected of being infected with this process.
These include appropriate risk management for operators, such as low-voltage air traffic control, and personal protective equipment for work.
Many of the advantages of COVID-19 may affect the work.
Because of illness, workers may be absent from work to take care of others or because of possible contact.
Some foods are needed and can be used to obtain these foods (such as junk food or delivery or drive-thru service) from both sides of the business.
Finally, COVID-19 can be prevented from sending things from the geographical areas that were severely affected. A plan for planning and responding to a terrorist disease can be used to indicate protective measures.
The plans aim at the associated levels of risks with different workplaces and activities, including the causes of the risks arising from contact sources, from the home and the community, and the causes of the personal risks of workers, such as age or long-term medical care.
They also describe the necessary controls to address these risks and plans to be prepared for situations that may arise as a result of the disease.
Plans for the preparation and response of infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
In response to disasters, the aim is to reduce tensions between workers, to protect people at risk of parallel health risks, to maintain business activities and to reduce the impact on other organisations in the chain of supply.
The business has an impact on the response of the population to the disease.
A system of risk management is a structure that is widely used to control occupational safety and health performance.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be removed, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal protection.
Engineering controls are linked to the behaviour of workers, but to separate workers from the risks of work, and it can be the most satisfying solution to implement it.
Administrative controls are changes in working policies or methods that require action by an employee or an employer.
Personal protective tools (P.I.) are considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control, but this may help to prevent some exhibits.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of the risks involved, such as proper fittings (such as respirators), continuous and proper monitoring, regular inspection, monitoring and replacement, and proper opening, cleaning and disposal to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Employment Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), there is a minimum of professional contact between people and other workers at low risk.
The main measures of the proposed conflict prevention for all workplaces include using barbed hands and hands, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, providing air-respiratory teaching, tissue and garbage, preparing them for a different technology or shift of day, encouraging workers to use other tools and tools, and keeping the work environment clean and up-to-date.
An essential step in keeping workers, customers, interviewers and others safe at work is the rapid identification and separation of potential attackers.
All workers with severe respiratory disease are advised to stay in the U.S. disease control and prevention centre until they are free from exposure to at least 24 hours of energy, signs of fire, and other precursors, and should mention the principles of disease leave that allow workers to stay home to care for a sick family member, and should be aware of these principles.
According to OSHA, contact between dangerous jobs is not known or suspected of having a COVID-19, but there is a need for close or close contact between six feet (1.8 m) of people who have recently been attacked by SARS-CoV-2 because of the widespread public disease or the widespread spread of COVID-19.
Adjustments include adjustments to the parameters with which the parameters are public, such as changes in the environment of the school, changes in the environment of high density, and changes in some of the more advanced properties. For this and for higher risk groups the adjustments in the engineering controls include the addition of higher performance filters and changes in the performance of the adjustments, changes in the changes in physical limitations of the clean plastics, and adjustments in the settings for the client management. For this and for higher risk groups the adjustments in the adjustment of the adjustments in the parameters of the adjustments to the manager's performance, adjustments in the adjustment of the

Those in the group need to use a respirator for a break.
If a person gets sick on the plane, the proper controls to protect workers and other passengers are to separate the sick person from others 6 feet away, to identify a member of the staff to serve the sick person, and to tell the sick person to make a face mask or to cover his face and nose during coughing or coughing.
While responding to the call of the sick traveler or touching the lips or possible contaminated surfaces of the body, the treatment glaucoma of the kabin crusaders should be worn and additional personal protective equipment should be used if the sick journey is hot, continuous or inhaled.
Gloves and other negotiable items should be cancelled in a life-threatening way, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleared and evacuated. For commercial ships and other shipping ships together, the risk management should be delayed if they are sick, keep themselves separate, and inform the ship's medical centre immediately of the fire or other features of the ship's life.
In the case of example, the person who has been separated should be a medical follow-up to the cabin. In the case of the benefits of school and child service, in the absence of a public disease crisis, if someone who has been attacked enters the school building, it recommends that the CDC be temporarily closed to clean or free.
When the disease is spread from the lowest to the lowest in the community, social remoteness can be implemented, such as the cancellation of Field Trips, Assembly and other major collections, such as physical education or music class or cafeteria; the expansion of distance between the desks, the arrival and travel times, the limitation of unnecessary visitors, and the use of a different health office for children living with flu.
When the disease spreads widely in the local community, further expansion of the school’s ability to maintain social distance can be considered to increase the risk of health risks to workers by CDC.
All law enforcement officials who need to communicate with people who are sure to have a COVID-19 or suspected, are advised to follow the same instructions as early medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If workers come into close contact when they are afraid, their duet belts and tools should be clean and live using a home safe spray or Wi-Fi, followed by a method to control and cancel the PPE used.
OSHA considers some of the health and death-related relationships between health and death workers in the high or high risk categories.
High-risk work in contact includes health care, assistance, labs and medical transport workers who know or suspect COVID-19.
If workers are able to edit aerosol-induced methods, or if they know that COVID-19 is present, or if they are suspected of having samples, they become at high risk of contact.
Among the aerosol-induced methods are to enter a tunnel, collect cassette reporting methods, broncoscopy, some dental methods and tests or tools.
High-profile personnel at risk of death include those who knew or were suspected of having a COVID-19 at the time of death; it is very likely that they will have a high level of contact if they are able to edit the target. These risk groups include additional engineering controls for people at risk are known as COVID-19 or are suspected of having a separate home for patients, when the methods of protection are being developed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable for some health care and health care.
Samples should be handled according to level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that if patients are suspected of having COVID-19, they should be separated into solitary waiting areas, which are known to have SARS-CoV-2 or suspected of having 6 feet in operation, as well as OSHA-PPE for people who are developing aerosol processes.
In addition to health tests, training and medical tests in the United States, the NIOSH-licensed N95 or better filtering Facebook receiver must be used for a comprehensive, written safety program.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve the work's will. WHO does not recommend coverage, as the coovid-19 does not spread through the body parts, but it is a respiratory disease.
WHO only recommends a social mask for screening operators on the way in.
WHO recommends a social mask, Googles, or face shield, Gaun and Gloves for those who are taking samples of the respiratory system without an aerosol-induced method.
If any arousal-response process is edited, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 receptors.
In view of the lack of global P.I. supply, WHO P.I. recommends using such physical interfaces as transparent communication to reduce the need for telemedicine, and those involved in direct care only allow a COVID-19 patient to stay in the home, to use only the P.I. for specific tasks, without removing the respertrator while taking multiple diseases in the same disease, allowing the P.P. to continue its use to monitor and adapt the supply chain and to encourage the masking of people who are not monitored.

We see ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The global continent of COVID-19 is an event that highlights global human relations and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no view of its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the global compassion, cooperation and social structure of this organization.
The warmth, trust and care we have seen among all of our colleagues through e-mails, calls and chats is a remarkable competition of the incredible people with whom we are happy enough to work with.
I'm very grateful and proud to have all of you as a co-worker.
Last week a man exchanged his praise for our work with me.
They reminded me how important Wikipedia is for the world at the moment and how powerful it is to be available online and to everyone.
If your job enables you to do this, it will keep you on the site, or it will save our employees, or it will keep our communities safe.
Wikipedia needs information from the world, now much more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
The importance of this mission, and for your role, we will make significant changes to how we work together this week.
Consistent with our work and our schedule
As rabbin mentioned earlier, C-Tam met last night to discuss our statement and to set schedules for the next day and months.
We thought of the right response to the situation we are facing and considered the best way to keep the organization alive at that time.
Most of us wanted to remove the pressure and support our goal for the long term.
If you need to back up the dial, there's no problem.
For all employees, regulators, and contractors:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day until the next announcement, or 20 hours a week.
We're not announcing vacation - if you can work more normally, the mission can apply to you.
But at this point the world is uncertain, and whether you need to take care of your loved one or go to the doctor, you are our priority.
We're not watching your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
It's necessary to say it, but we're saying it.
There is no need for a sick holiday or a PTO - just tell your manager and help your team to correct the calendars and times, so you can make sure that the main areas of activity are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform the T&C Ops branch so that T&C can help and ensure that your situation is properly addressed by the authorities).
All the people who work for hours will be paid.
We have already said so, and we are still promising to respect our promise to our employees who work as our agents and hours.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours of work in normal circumstances.
It includes, if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people are using their mental pressure from around the world as a means of moving towards a specific goal.
What we do can be incredibly successful, especially at this time.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to contact your manager so that we know what we can expect and agree.
Some tasks are considered to be necessary.
There's something we have to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (including others) are working indivisiblely and may need additional help.
We will start a process with all our sectors to evaluate the current targets and change our focus to help with our mission.
We have a lot of work to do, but all of us will focus on the most necessary projects.
You don't have to get hurt if you're slow.
After the overtime is cut, we don't plan to do double work.
You do not seem to have enough hours to complete a task within the timeout, which is not real.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and we will work to set new targets and deadlines wherever appropriate.
What does the APP (annual plan) do?
To match our new reality and the expectations of working hours, we want to match the deadline for our annual plan delivery 2020-2021.
Our speech is a proposal for an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will give workers the opportunity to give priority to their work, to take care of themselves, and to make more time for budget preparation, as well as to accept the demands of all people who want to work on short notice for the next few weeks.
The expansion of the time limit greatly reduces the scope of the current plan and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposals to the board next week, and we will update as soon as possible on the next steps.
Thank the APP team for your leadership in this area.
Office status, contacts and cleanup
Last week we found out that one of our SF-based partners may have come to contact the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we have appointed a virus-safi team to survive all the consequences of the San Francisco office.
Every floor and lobby and the elevator banks that came into our floor, they used an anti-virus of hospital value to survive.

We feel free to leave the office when we decide to come back.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has been exchanged with us by its COVID-19 protocol and all DC-based members.
Last week, in line with the instructions given to our DC office, San Francisco has been transferred to a fully remote setup.
Some of our NYC-based employees know that we were also discussing taking a place in Brooklyn.
This discussion is ongoing but may take a while.
Some of our employees are working away for the first time.
Our long-term long-term partners know that this could be harmonisation, and they wanted to give you some advice:
If the meeting is too long, limit it to one or two hours.
If a longer session is required, consider how these can be divided into smaller parts for a few days.
Please explain the meeting, keep an overview and send the text items first.
Use Google Docs and Zoom tools to make it easier to connect to live support and connections, by default.
Put a lead in order to make each meeting easier, ask someone to watch the questions in the chat and watch over the speaker list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes in collaboration).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Use yourwellness reminder for snapshots.
Join the #remote channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the assigned task.
The HR Task Management Group is looking at web-based Argonmix guidelines to help expand the work on the foundation.
Last week, we told all community contributors to cancel public events like Editathan, which are being held in Wikimedia, until WHO announces the overrun.
We tell them that we have understood that our request for cancellation and other legislation may make it impossible for them to complete the grant scheme and that no one will be punished for delaying or correcting these objectives.
In the coming week, we will send further guidance to Wikimania and other regional and community conferences.
In general, poisoning to escape from the global public, but at the same time Wikimedia and others, both seem to have the ability and clarity to pay attention to their own public.
The next day, CRT is working to create a page on a meta-wiki so that we can monitor the effects and provide a place for the public to follow our contacts with them.
Contact us at the center of COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special guest meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
We will use this time to share more updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
In this situation, we are all united and we will help as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue searching for information from this email, and you can get other essential information about COVID-19 in the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with workers living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workstream or coverage challenge, or if you need any other help, please do not hesitate to report and work with CRT.
We're here to help and fix as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive subject, please email the director of HR International Global Operations to Bryan Juden.
None of these changes should be seen as a distortion of our work and responsibility.
Rather, it is a recognition that our work and responsibilities must now be handled in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide what we need, and provide what the world depends on.
When the time comes, our plans will wait for us.
Now to help each other and make room for the important work that is coming in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
To do this, you all need cooperation, so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can stay healthy when you need to.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your mouth!

B'Angiotensin-Transforming Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a source associated with fusfus, mucous membranes, heart, Kidney and the outside of the cell.
By reducing the level of ACE2 angiotensin-II, the associated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and increasing Ang(1-7) has become a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transforming source 2 is a jink combined metallogen that is at the top of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has a N-terminal wallpapered M2 domain and a C-terminal calectrine renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose source is the active area of the Fusfus and other Tsura cells.
The outside domain of ACE2 is separated from the Transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as Shadows, resulting in the release of high-voltage protein into the bloodstream and finally through the removal.
Most of the ACE2 parts include: the type II cell of the Fusfus mainly associated with the cell alviolas of the ACE2, the enerosites of the small region, the most of the limbs and the top endothelial cells and the testicles of the pancreas.
Serebral Cortex, Straitum, Hypothalamus, and Brensteme can also be found in the expression ACE2 mRNA.
The primary task of ACE2 was to work as an exchange of ACE.
ACE Angiotensin I divides the hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
From ACE2 angiotensin II, carbexil-terminal amino acid phenylalanine (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed it by a vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may distinguish several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinerphin, and grellin.
ACE2 controls the delivery of SLC6A19, an ACE2-independent amino acid, and is associated with heart failure.
As a transmembrane protein, some ACE2 acts as the primary point of entry into the cell, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which is responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (which is responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, in the ENzymatic domains of ACE2, SPIC S1 proteins are placed between the cells and the endocytosis and the virus and the enzyme in the endozom.
Host serum proteins TMPRSS2 also require primary S protein, which is currently being investigated as possible, which has helped some to estimate that it can help fight reduced ACE2 seizures in the cell.
However, a number of specialized societies and regulators have recommended continuing ACE invibitor and ARB therapy.
"On July 11, 2012, a systematic review and meta-analysis showed that "compared to controls, the risk of harm caused by the use of an ACE invibitor was significantly 34% of the reduction."
"In addition, "ACE-treated patients, especially those at high risk of pneumonia, were at risk of stroke and heart disease."
"The risk of death associated with Neumonia was also associated with the use of ACE inviators, although its results were less than they were able to achieve in terms of the overall risk of Neumonia."
Ricbinent Human ACE2 (rhACE2) was considered an agonist therapy for the loss of severe Fusus, and had to improve the hemodynamics and oxygen relations of the child with lipopolysaccharide-induced severe respiratory tract.
One half of the human rhACE2 is about 10 hours and is reported in 30 minutes, and the duration of action (situation) is 24 hours.
It appears from various sources that people of the first category may not be able to endure the RAS inviter or disease where angiotensin II binding is increased, the hope of rACE2 has been assessed in the input tests of RAACE2 for acute respiratory disease (acute respiratory tract stress syndrome).
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to detect contact as a response to the 2019-20 core virus, i.e. anyone who is in contact with a infected person ("contact")."
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed by the authorities in some areas and areas.
A number of substructures have been created to create contact identification apps.
The privacy concerns have been expressed, especially those systems which operate on the basis of geographical location of the app users.
The pending proxy access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log in and out of other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would directly integrate the effectiveness of helping such Bluetooth-based apps into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an application with Alipay to check that citizens have had contact with their COVID-19 people.
It is used around 200 Chinese cities, using an app called TraceTogether in Singapore.
The app has created a local information technology group, it has been published as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia "Stop Korona!", a Bluetooth-based app that aims to identify the signs of potential offenders and provide a rapid response by the health authorities.
The app has been created by the Minister of Communications and Technology and the Minister of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been waiting for the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store to be approved.
"On April 12th, the government announced that the link is at a progressive stage in the search for app development and that it will be useful for doing so within a few weeks. The app was designed in the same way as in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on the TraceTogether App and the BlueTrace Protocol of Singapore. COVID-19, in Moscow, is planning to launch a geofencing app for patients suffering from diseases so that they will not leave home.
Professor Ross Anderson of the University of Cambridge's Safety Project has listed the most useful problems with systems based on which there is a lack of efficacy if there is a limited number of people with Falso Positive and App acceptability.
The "Cronaviras" application has solved the concerns about the range of "Cronaviras" and has defined the limitations of the application that the organizations can only place "Cronvarias" or "Convarias" in the application store by limiting the application to "Convarias".
Google and Amazon have applied the same rules.
Those who preach for the sake of privacy have expressed concern about the rights of the public with the use of the Kornaviras apps, in particular about the completion of the surveillance structures designed to combat the global plague after the threat has gone away.
Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have issued a statement calling for this kind of monitoring.
The organisation announced eight conditions for the government project:
"The guard must be "inaccessible, necessary and inappropriate."
To increase surveillance and surveillance, it is necessary to maintain a set of satellites;
Data must be limited to COVID-19;
Data security and unknown identity must be protected and security based on evidence;
Digital monitoring was required to close the gap and boundary gap;
Any data sharing with third parties must be clarified in law;
Citizens must have the right to protest against abuse and against abuse.
The "Health Specialists and Border Groups" will need to play an important role. The German KOS computer club (CC) and Reporters Wideboard (Grangen) (RSF) have launched a checklist."
The proposed Google/Apple plan is intended to resolve persistent monitoring problems if they do not need to be monitored from operating systems on these devices.
Instead of some countries used surveillance over the network-side location, which requires the download of apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based detection was authorized.
There is a potential privacy problem with network-based solutions that have unresolved location information.
However, not all systems on the central server require access to the personal data; a multiple-secret storage system has been created using the central server for communication only (see below).
An app-free system was used in South Korea to monitor contacts.
Instead of using an appointed app, the system added tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and map data, and sent messages to possibly offenders through text messages.
In spite of the use of this information to warn about possible contacts, the government has taken advantage of public information about the location, some things are allowed to change far-reaching in the privacy law after the threat of MRS.
Many of this information is available to the public through the app and website, considering the use of both central and private systems across Germany.
Until 6 April 2020, the resolution has not yet been published.
At least a well-established idea of the secret-saved contact with a real part of the research started in 2013. By 7 April 2020, more than a dozen experts were working on a secret-band solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of other mobile users.
However, the PEPP-PT is a solution that has both central and non-centred modes and is not a single rule of conduct. The concentrated behaviors include the close detection of concentrated privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN), the sensitivity behaviour and processes for mobile communication detection (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, detectable personal data never leaves the device and occurs only among all the corresponding devices.
The MIT Media Lab is publishing a private group SafePaths, a platform to monitor the location or interface data collection and use when using and using privacy-protection techniques to monitor the scope of COVID-19.
It's a “like an embezzlement: keeping privacy in a continent” (Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic) based on a paper published in March 2020. Another such effort was by Enigma MPC to establish a SafeTrace platform, which was created by the company that created the privacy technology company MIT Media Lab.
Without informing the user about the privacy of their data, SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to provide sensitive location and health information to other users and authorities.
On 5 April 2020, the Public TCN Group was set up by a number of groups that gathered together on the same basis to identify and warn the public interoperability of the app in order to reduce the partition and to reduce the need for additional procedures and procedures.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has a free-source BlueTrace protocol used by its government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which companies properly control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to find people in contact that will protect privacy according to their claim, which operates on the basis of a mission of Bluetooth Low Energy Technology and a security-protection cryptography.
They also published a description of the basic technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system plans to take three steps:
To enable governments to find out kornaviras, scroll-out tools
In iOS and Android, this activity is directly implemented: Google and Apple first distributes the operating system through the operating system update and then resolves it in the same way after the crash.

Bi'Coronaviras Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Civilian Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cornaviras 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a infectious disease.
The common sights include fire, cough, and breath.
Other signs may include fatigue, professional illness, diarrhea, throat disease, gorilla strength, and abdominal pain.
It is usually about five days from the beginning of the virus contact, but it can be between two and forty days.
Although in most cases mild prejudices may appear, in some cases Viral Neumonia and several members may fail.
By April 17, 2020, 210 countries and regions reported more than 2.24 million deaths, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and the virus is often spread through the tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny particles of humans during close communication.
When there is no breath, they usually fall on the ground or on the surface rather than spread long distances.
After touching the contaminated surface, people may also be infected with their eyes, noses or faces.
The virus can survive for 72 hours on the surface.
In the first three days of the onset of the symptoms, it is most aggressive, although the symptoms may spread before the onset of the symptoms and at the next stage of the disease. The model method for the detection of the disease is the actual-time conversion by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the Nasopharyngeal Soyab.
Sicknesses in the virus are being advised to use masks for those who are suspected and their cleaners.
The recommendations for using public masks are different, some authorities recommend using them, some recommend using them, and others require them.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local seizures of the disease have been recorded in most countries throughout the six WHO regions.
Viruses may be undetectable or may see such symptoms as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
The essential features include breathing, unrest or stress, confusion, illness and face or suffocation; medical services are recommended immediately if these are present.
Less common, high breath symptoms such as cough, nose, or throat problems can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, vomiting, and diarrhea have been seen as a percentage of the proportion.

The role of these unmarked carriers in the event of an attack has not yet been fully known; however, primary evidence indicates that they may have a role to play in spreading the disease.
The proportion of people who could not see the symptoms is currently unknown and studied, the report of the Korean Disease Control and Prevention Centres (KCDC) said that 20% of all certain diseases were undetected while in the hospital.
On April 1st, the Chinese National Health Commission began to include undetectable diseases among its daily infections; that day there were 130 (78%) undetected during the test.

Although the virus is not usually windy, the National Science Academy indicated that the bioaerosol can be disrupted and the wind collector outside the home gave a positive sample of the Viral RNA.
Some treatments, such as intubation and cardiopalmonary resuscitation (CPR) may result in breath loss and windy areas.
While this risk is thought to be less likely to spread through the soil, the virus is the most affected by human signs; the symptoms can be spread before it is clear.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not quite clear how it spreads easily, but one person usually attacks two or three people.
In particular, the cardboard found the virus detectable for one day, plastic (polypropylene) and steinless steel (AISI 304) for three days and 99% for four hours.
It changes depending on heat and temperature.
Saban and dithering can also work properly; the subshadows break down the virus's protective layer, disable it, and release it from the walls and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as Benzalconium chloride and Chlorhexidin Gluconet (Animal Adjuvant), are less effective, in a study in Hong Kong, the green samples were taken two days after hospitalization.
The first five of the six patients showed a lot of them in the virus and the second day of the six patients showed a lot of them in the virus.
Civian Acute Respiratory Syndrome Kornaviras 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe severe sneezing syndrome that was first separated from three patients in Neumonia associated with his severe sneezing disease.
All the features of the NOVEL SARS-COV-2 virus are actually related to viruses.
The virus dies outside of the human body in the home of Sabana, which destroys its protective bud, and has a close relationship with SARS-CoV-2.
Fusfus is the most affected part of the COVID-19 because of the large amount of Enzyme Engiotensin-Transforming Enzyme 2 (ACE2) virus-derived cells in the type II of Fusfus.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "Spike" to connect to the food cell."
12% of the infected in the Uhan hospital in China experienced severe heart attacks and became more severe in the disease.
During the development of the disease, systemic signs of reaction and unscrupulous blood pressure may be higher than the rate of cardiovascular precursors, but severe myocardial heart attack may also be associated with ACE2 receptors.
The ACE2 receptors are fast in the heart and connected to the heart.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were seen in patients with COVID-19, and it may be associated with weak prognosis.
Although the epithelial cell associated with SARS-COV-2 is prone to go to ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the pathogen GM-CSF-encrypting cells among COVID-19 patients have been shown to be associated with the re-introduction (recruitment) of the newly created IL-6 monosites and the pathology of serious fusfus.
Phossetic infiltrates have been reported in the body test.
WHO has published some tests protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is actually using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out in the taste samples obtained by the Nezoferangial Soyab; however, Nazal Soyab or Thuthur may also be used.
In general, results can be obtained within two days from a few hours.
Blood can be tested, but two blood samples should be taken within two weeks and the results should be low in immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to separate Kornaviras strands and publish genetic sequences so that researchers around the world could develop polymerase chain sales (PCR) tests alone to detect viral infections.
On 4th April 2020, the anti-Semitic tests (which can detect active seizures and identify whether a person has been infected in the past) were ready for development but have not yet been widely used.
In the field of testing, Chinese experience has shown only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first local pollination test to be used at the end of that month, which recommended methods of detection of infectious diseases by Zongnan Hospital published by the U.S.
A border, an unprecedented and backward distribution is common in the area of the initial attacks of Multilober Ground-Glass.
Depending on the progress of the disease, there may be a sub-pleural priority, unplayed paving (filling the transformative alvila) and integration.
There is very little information available about the pathophysiology and microscopic damage of COVID-19.
Main pathological data for the Mayan investigation are:
Macroscopy: Pluricy, Pericarditis, Long Consolidation and Palmonary Shoth
The four types of viral pneumonia appear:
Light Neumonia: Palmonary Adima, Neumocyte Hyperplasia, Large-Size ATPical Neumocytes, International Supply with Lymphocytic Infiltration, and Multinutlated Danb Cells
Major Neumonia: Degraded Degraded Alvioler (DAD)
The cause of severe thirst syndrome (ARDS) and fatal hypoxemia is DAD.
Neumonia Sarano: Interstitial Fibrosis of Alviola’s Gorgeous Organism and Fusfus
Blood: read-only intervascular binding (DIC); Lyukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive mechanisms to reduce the possibility of seizures include sitting at home, avoiding popular places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and not touching the eyes, nose or face in the right way.
The CDC has suggested that the face and nose should be covered with tissue and that if no tissue is found, the inside of the chamber should be used.
The right health of the hand is encouraged after coughing or coughing.
In order to limit the seizure of unmarked persons, the CDC has suggested using the cover of clothing for the public. Schools and workplaces are closed, travel is restricted, and large communities are out of reach and social distance is planned to reduce contact with large groups.
It also includes instructions to keep a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
"There is no known cure that is effective against COVID-19, since no vaccine is expected until 2021, so the main part of the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce marine learning, it is known as "balancing the cycle."
For at least 20 seconds, the CDC advises people to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water, especially after walking in the toilet or having hands with eyes, before eating and after coughing, after coughing or coughing.
It recommends that at least 60% of alcohol-based hand sanitizers be used only if no soap or water is found. It provides two WHO formulations for local production in places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
These preparations derive from the activity of antimicrobials from Ethanl or isopropane.
"Hydrogen is used to remove behindreal traces in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis."
Glissarl is added as a humanactant.
People are guided by the auxiliary ministry, which can include the use of Arol therapy, oxygen aid, and other important factors.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying viruses should wear a normal mask.
The extracorporal membrane oxidation (ECMO) is used to solve the problem of sleep disorder, but its benefits are still not considered.
Personal health and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve disease-resistance.
WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations to care for patients with COVID-19 in the hospital.
In the United States, IBCC has organized free medical advice for ITCCs and palmonologists.
No specific treatment for COVID-19 until April 2020.
For observations, parasitel (asitaminophen) is recommended rather than Ibuprofen for the primary use of some medical professionals.
Caution should be exercised to reduce the risk of virus infection, especially in the health environment when methods such as intubation or hand ventilation are being developed that can create windshields.
In addition to using Covide-19, health care professionals recommend that they keep the CDC certified alerts, touch alerts, and air-borne warnings at an airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR). The CDC describes instructions for use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the lifetime of the global continent.
The tools proposed are: PPE Goun, Respirator or Facemask, Eye Protection and Medical Gloves. If available, the Respirator is desirable (instead of Facemask).
The N95 Respirator has been approved for the environment, but the masks have been approved for use under the FDA Emergency Use Authority (U.S.).
These are designed to protect against atmospheric pollution, but efficacy against certain nutrients is not guaranteed for specific labelling use.
If no mask was found, CDC recommends using masks made at home as a cover or last cover.
Most diseases are not serious enough to require technical ventilation or options, but hundreds of them are serious.
High-voltage nasal cannula or bi-level positive air pressure prevents intubation in hospitals with some evidence of it being actively studied in people with respiratory failure related to COVID-19.
I don't know if any of these two will lead to the same benefit for those with serious diseases.
Some doctors choose to use it as an innovative technical ventilation because this technique limits the range of windshields compared to high currents, the most serious events among older adults (who are 60 years of age and in particular 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, there is no adequate hospital bed, which limits the ability to manage health to cope with the number of serious COVID-19 diseases that need to be filled.
A Chinese survey showed that 5% of intensive care units were filled, 2.3% needed technical assistance for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, almost 30% of people with COVID-19 infections in the hospital eventually entered ISIU.
In COVID-19, severe sweetness syndrome (ARDS) develops and mechanical ventilation is becoming more complex.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP capable fans are needed to maximize the distribution of oxygen and then to reduce the impact of the fan's fumes and the risks of Neumothorax.
High-level PEEP can also be found in older fans.
A possible medical study was started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are under investigation.
It seems like Remdesive's best hope.
Although new medicines may take 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already authorised for other uses or are already being tested.
Antiviral medicines can be tested among people with serious diseases.
The WHO-proposed volunteers will participate in a possible medical efficacy and safety trial, which has temporarily approved the FDA Convescent plasma as a experimental medicine where life is seriously or immediately in danger.
This is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched to deal with China's disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app uses monitoring data to identify possible potential risks of conflict with 'close contact' and the result.
Each user can verify the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-consistency but also warns local health authorities to monitor people who are infected in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and people who are in contact with them.
In March 2020, Israeli government permitted security organisations to monitor the data of those suspected of being co-incineration.
The system was adopted to protect and enforce people who could be in contact with the displaced.
In addition, in March 2020, the German Federal government distributed telecoms to the Danish Institute to prevent and investigate the virus.
Russian facial detection technology has been used to identify the Quarantine burglar.
"Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Gallera reported that mobile phone operators told him that "40% of people are turning around as they do."
The German government organises 48 hours of last week's hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for a global solution against the Kornaviras area.
People may feel sick because of quarantine, travel regulations, medical responses, or fear of being attacked.
"BBC Rory O'Connor quoted as saying, "A great deal of damage to human mental health and health, insecurity, health, mental pressure and economic hardship."
Like other common high-swelling diseases, such as colding, this disease can progress very slowly or without any sign.
Small diseases usually heal within a week, but it may take between three and six weeks to heal serious or fatal diseases.
In other cases, women who are pregnant may be at risk of a serious attack on COVID-19 on the basis of data such as SARS and MERS, but there is a loss of COVID-19 data, and some people may create COVID-19 pneumonia and damage the fungus.
Most of the diseases can greatly increase the severity of COVID-19 fever syndrome (ARDS) which can be caused by nausea, septic shock or multiple-fold nausea.
The complexity associated with COVID-19 includes sepsis, abnormal blood clotting and heart, Kidney, and damage to everything.
In the case of 6% of those who were hospitalized with COVID-19, the abnormality of blood clots, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, has been seen in 4% of the group.
Approximately 20-30% of the people present with COVID-19 have seen an increase (transaminesis) in the number of people.
According to the same report, there were ten days between the source and the time between death and the symptoms of five hospitals.
Although the patients who moved to ICU were in hospital and had time between death and seven days.
In a study of primary infections, between six and 41 days was 14 days between the time of death.
A survey by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China showed that the death rate of men was 2.8%, while women were 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of Fusfus's samples reveal the damage of the read Alviola with the spread of cell fibromyxide in both Fusfus.
Viral cytopathic changes were monitored in Neumosite.
Photo by Fusfus, similar to Acute Respiratory Distresis Syndrome, ARDS.
Among the reported death of the National Health Commission in China, 11.8% reported an increase in cardiac arrest or troponin.
According to the US March report, 89% of those who were hospitalized were hospitalized before, and the benefits of an area's economics and medical facilities could also affect the mortality rate.
The death rate from this disease is not only due to the regional differences but also due to the procedural disorders.
The rate of death can be estimated to be higher than the rate of reduction of mild infections.
However, the real issue is that the result of the death in the past, which means that the rate of death is being underestimated.
More than non-smokers are likely to be more serious about COVID-19 and more than 2.4 are the need for intensive care and the possibility of death or death.
Among some people treated with this disease, the Hong Kong Hospital authorities observed a 20% to 30% reduction in the capacity of Fusfus and reported damage to Ffus' scans.
This may also lead to post-intensive Kai's syndrome.
By March 2020, it was unknown whether it was effective and long-term illiteracy among people affected by the previous outbreak.
There is much evidence of insecurity based on the behaviour of other Kornaviras, but in the future, Kornaviras's positive results have been reported from COVID-19.
These events are feared as a result of more permanent attacks than re-attacks.
The virus is thought to have a natural and animal source, through an increased infection.
The real source is unknown, but in December 2019, the attacks were conducted almost entirely by human attacks.
A review of the first 41 confirmed outbreaks of COVID-19 was published in January 2020 at the Lansette, where the first date of the observations was announced as December 1, 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported on December 8, 2019 on the first point of comment.
Some methods are usually used to determine the amount of death.
These numbers vary according to the area, and the number of tests, health care quality, medical options, the time taken after primary birth, and the population settings such as age, sex and public health are affected.
Towards the end of 2019, the death code U07.1 of the early ICD-10 disease was determined due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lab, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lab was not confirmed because of covid-19 caused by the death code U07.2 and the death-to-case ratio is to divide the number of deaths in a given period of time by the number of deaths in the patient.
Based on statistics from the Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of deaths and injuries worldwide is 6.9% by 2020 (153,822/2,240,191).
The number of patients who have died in a disease is equivalent to that of the region. Other systems include the death rate (case factor rate, CFR), which represents the percentage of those who have died in the disease and the rate of death of the infection (infection factor rate, IFR), which is the percentage of those who have died in the disease.
These statistics do not have a time limit and follow a given population from conflict to conflict.
Although not all infected people create antibiotics, how many people have been infected can provide information on the presence of antibiotics.
Casiglion Deadda, a small village in Italy where 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelte, this disease was spread through a carnival festival and spread among underage people, which is relatively low due to death, and all COVID-19 deaths can be officially classified.
Furthermore, German health is not affected.
In the Netherlands, there may be an antidote of nearly 3%, according to the estimates of blood donors.
69 people (0.004%) are confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The effects of excessive death and death on men and women are different.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, there is a higher rate of death among men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50th room, and the gap between men and women is in the 90th room.
There were 2.8 percent of men and 1.7 percent of women in China.
This gender difference is not known for the right reasons, but may be due to genetic and behavioural issues.
Gender-based immunological differences, the behavior of smoking among women, and the development of sympathies among young men, such as high blood pressure, can play a role in higher mortality rates.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died in COVID-19.
Since April 2020, the U.S. government has not been monitoring data on the sex of the COVID-19 attack.
The study found that viral diseases such as Ibola, HIV, Influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are more likely to come into contact with women and their virus.
"On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that it does not mean CO, VI is a virus, D is a disease, and 19 is when the event was first marked: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to match the international recommendations of Kalimalept (e.g. China), to avoid references to animal populations or to human groups. The name of the virus created by COVID-19 is known as CIVID Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO uses additional "COVID-19 Virus" and "COVID-19 Responsible Virus."
"The disease and the virus are generally referred to as "the crown virus."
"The virus and the disease are generally referred to as "cronaviras" and "Cronaviras" during the initial experience in the city of Uhan.
In January 2020, WHO recommended that virus and disease strains as a temporary name for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guidelines, be used as a virus-nCov and 2019-nCOV.
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 government name was released on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limited power in China, some digital designers are printing health components such as Nexal Soyab and Ventilator.
For example, if an Italian hospital needs a fan's love, it is impossible to provide it within the necessary time limit, a local new organization has tested the food of the vendor and produced the necessary 100 good nights.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the disease's source, level, prevention, medical care and other aspects of the program was developed, misinformation and rumors were rapidly spread online.
It seems that humans are capable of spreading viruses among other animals.
The study was unable to find any evidence to make copies of the virus between dry, bone and marrow.
No medicinal products or vaccines have been authorised to treat this disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and art researchers are conducting international research on vaccine and medicine for COVID-19.
In March, the four most promising World Health Organisations promise to assess the impact of the existing anti-viral age on the health care system's "personal support testing".
There are no vaccines, but various organisations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
The previous work on SARS-COV is being used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are using ACE2 clients to access both human cells.
Looking for three ink schemes.
First, researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
Whether it is disabled or dead, the goal of using that virus is to release the immediate insecurities of the human body for a new attack by COVID-19.
The second strategy, Subunit Vaccine, is to create a vaccine that is sensitive to the indiscriminate terrorism in the specific subunit of the virus.
In the field of SARS-CoV-2, the study S-Spike Protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 Enzyme planet.
The third is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, an accessory technique for typing).
In order to ensure safety and efficacy, any of these techniques must be tested by testing vaccines. On 16 March 2020, four volunteers in Seattle were first launched by a Indian vehicle.
There is a genetic code in Vaccine that does not damage the virus because of the disease. It is indicated as a potential challenge for development of SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
From April 2020, more than 300 active Indian trucks are running.
Seven studies evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxycloquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being used for antiviral drugs, and reports on nine Phase III tests across Remdesiver across the country at the end of April.
A rapid review of the development of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Some existing antiviral drugs, including Remdesiver, Chloroquine and Hydroxycloquine, Lopinavir / Retonavir and Interferon Bitter, are being evaluated.
In March 2020, Remdesive has proven to be effective.
There has been significant improvement in patients who have been treated with Remdesives.
Phase III Indian Trails are being organized in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorocwin, previously used for malaria surgeons, was studied in China in February 2020 with primary results.
However, research needs to be explored.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquin.
However, Uhan Institute of Virology, when recommending the use of a village's drug every day, notes that this drug can be very dangerous and deadly.
On 28 March 2020, COVID-19 authorised the use of hydroxycloquine and chloroquine in FDA, based on the views of physicians in patients with COVID-19, including interferon, Ribavirin or Umifenovir in the Chinese 7th version of the COVID-19 directive.
Primary information indicates that Ribavirin requires high levels of medicine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro.
After showing a low density of SARS-CoV-2, Nitazxanid was recommended for further VV study. Studies have shown that transmembrane protease serum 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of primary SPIC protein with the ACE2 receptor through the reciprocal operation of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to agthromycin, chloroquine and hydroxycloquine studies have a more severe limitation that has prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study, and Oseltamivir SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro is not inhibited and there is no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The next stage of the major COVID-19 may be a complex situation in the context of a sitocaine disaster.
There is evidence that the rapid release of hydroxicchloroquine is likely to result in a rapid release of cytokine, which has been included in the National Health Commission of China's medical manual after completion of a small study.
After seeing positive results among people with serious diseases, it goes through national phase 2 tests in Italy.
Sytokine is an anti-inflammatory disease, which is thought to be the cause of the death of some people.
In 2017, a different cause of CAR T cell therapy was approved by the Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist FDA based on the previous-related case study for treatment of the steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome.
To this day, there is no consistent, controlled evidence that Tosilizumab is a successful cure for CRS.
Those who have received relief from COVID-19 are being searched as a non-vaccinated vaccine for the long-lasting antibodies that they need.
The project was reviewed for SARS with undetected results.
Viral deactivation is a special method to prevent passive antibiotic therapy from defending SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibiotic-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of anti-inflammatory therapy, such as the use of produced monoclonal anti-inflammatory agents, are on the way to development.
Convalescent Siram's product, which is made up of blood cells taken from the infected patients, can be increased quickly to organize the virus.
Kornavir disease, a class of syndrome related
After hearing about the spread of the virus, Dr. Lee Wenliang, who died from COVID-19.
