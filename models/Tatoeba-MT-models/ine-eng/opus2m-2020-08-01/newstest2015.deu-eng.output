The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met his first important foreign visit since his election in May with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for enhanced nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also expects a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Police from Karatha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it in a 70 km/h zone and through Bushland to get away from the police in Bilbara.
Traffic policymakers in Karatha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had observed it leaving a tank station at the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stops and drove on the Burgess Road before moving to the bush, where the officers lost their eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the driver's description was later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karatha accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal and reckless driving.
He will appear before the Court of Justice in Karatha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands before two hotels because of the rape of women.
George Webster, 28, was charged at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rapeing a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, asleep, and couldn't signal an agreement."
Webster is also proposed to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set up the negotiating deadline for 17 November at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressionals Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a citizen right.
"As trade unions die, middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy president of the Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
I therefore proudly propose the Staff Authorisation Act, together with the Ombudsman John Lewis.
This fundamental law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination against trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-professional forces.
The addition of the National Labour Law Act to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to appeal to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalty - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way is to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill, the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the backlogs the trade unions were exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militaryized Autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to unity and joint trade and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was replaced by strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict or restrict this right shall be null and void, and measures which aim to do so shall be unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship over the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as it was assumed by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations Americans have accepted the fundamental assumption that labour rights are human rights.
When this country involves other countries in how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union could then participate in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government institutions - should be protected.
After providing these rights under protection in America it is indeed very wise to return to the American ideal, so that the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a wonderful market for industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and have redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judges temporarily stop the law that all clinics in Louisiana could force the closure
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the lawyer said it would have led to the closure of all five state detention clinics.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana in June and is due to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who perform the removals to require a patient admission right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judgeâ€™s decision means that doctors can continue to exercise legal ambiguities in advance while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are trying to achieve these rights," Federal Justice John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
A hearing shall be held for the judge within one month in order to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Detention advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a number of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors had gained so much time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana withdraw from a maintenance law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and president of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also reached doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of the 11 countries that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi not constitutionally appropriate.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics left in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Retirement advocates and the American College of Ostetricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that the right of admission of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Decommissioners are opposed to the fact that measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient instruction rights, the Center for Reproduction Rights shared with him.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop decommissioning, this doctor would, in fear of his safety, no longer perform the operation, the group said.
In its argument against the judgment, the representatives of Louisiana said that they would not be punished by doctors for the execution of abortions, while their applications would still be dependent on patient rights.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of death due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australians, in which 2005 egg-stock cancers were detected, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research Director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines may slow lung and ovary cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-diseases, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancers were already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher likelihood of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspected a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services in order to counter the distances, she proposed, as possible, to strengthen the service of inflected doctors to enable specialists to provide women closer to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, provided a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret lowering household owners
The decline, combined with an increased decline in the number of households under 35 years of age, could result in ten thousand pounds per year being lost by garden centres when young consumers today, according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "nuclear group for garden products".
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with their own home spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting for parking and the decreasing garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated Â£5 billion per year are implemented for sale.
In the large London area, where the proportion of households from 61 to 43 per cent has fallen over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that homes for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot plant.
Guy Barter, head of the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in an environment."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to the increasing number of households and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of better weather under unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri continues in Pakistan.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have stormed the state television PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protestors back out of PTV buildings.
The broadcaster introduced his operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sending it back.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they delivered pieces and stones equipped with security forces.
The police set up tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The army of the country therefore calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said, "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan proposes that Prime Sharif be involved in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated at the weekend, after Khan and Qadri had called their supporters to move Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spying reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has commissioned the country's oldest service diplomats to report a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister BÃ¼lent said that the US ambassador and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Mirror and the Online Magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important secret service of Germany Ankara in the visa, provided for significantly worse reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning: Locator threatens with consequences for Pendler
The federal strike of the pilot on Monday could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
The mission announced for 18-21 hours covers all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main focus of the alert is freight.

said the district president of the German LokomotivfÃ¼hrer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in DÃ¼sseldorf.
We're counting on significant losses.
There are no regional priorities.
The main focus of the alert is freight.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences specifically.
Police chief of Magaluf of corruption charged
On Friday, the prosecutors presented to the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of repression by policemen and employees of the city of CalviÃ .
The chief of the CalviÃ  police on the island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Commissioner-in-Office JosÃ© Antonio Navarro was investigated by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented to the State Prosecutor's Office for Corruption Control Mallorcas on Friday evidence of police repression and employees of the city of CalviÃ .
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption projects and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the government's veterinary economy had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our foundation of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer, Magaluf made international battle lines due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a trip to Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the orderly behaviour of alcoholised holidayers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-free tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellathio event took place, was forced to close for one year, while the Playhouse and the Kneipentour-Organiser Carnage together had to pay a penalty of â‚¬ 55,000 (US$ 73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular for young British vacationers, is also known for some accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", when people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRUHLING has ensured a winter surprise for South Australia, with severe sights and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
At night until 21:00, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already fallen on the night until Sunday.
The last defeat was the result of a series of short, stormy spectators, including a gust that started just 20 hours ago and provided almost 4mm defeat in about 10 minutes.
After the last week of winter had taken care of an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8Â°C.
The gentle weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane would have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a storm - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to continue.
At that time wind blows reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to proceed on a second country trip and finally set off at around 20.40.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a quantum flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16Â°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible viewers.
Mathies means: Maximum time to make a big network
In view of the elliptical technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switch centres, our columnist Bernd Mathies is comforted with an extremely trusted electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this here, I'm looking at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there's a thought behind this: If the cable wasn't, in the shortest time, all the listeners would fly around the house uninhabited, and that would be much more retro.
Nonetheless, does it apply to electronics (electronics?
No, tip error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world's newness of today's electroscrat is purchased from tomorrow - obsolete.
And for example, who still has a tube TV in the living room today, who just says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa at the radio tower this week brings again our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The Laie, who was once blind to the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are disseminated with intelligible speech to him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, is it still going?
What should be discussed with people who are apparently willing to expand such a Quark?
In fact, it has been going on for about 20 years, especially since we were supposed to network our house.
In order for the Yoghurt himself to check out so that the fireman informs us on his holiday on the Maldives that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we left the office from the air conditioning on our soon arrival...?
Yes, however, this requires an air conditioning system.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our bracelet, say "Saigen!" - and the vacuum cleaner goes home.
Irre.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating", around a industry identifier, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam gauge sends the weather report, and the data glasses show how long the pizza needs in the oven, but nothing is useful because we stand in the barn.
We also know from our daily practice that if a new fashionable device is needed once it is really urgent, the battery is guaranteed empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in airspace while rocket and mortar gunfire went down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fights.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket launchers in southern Israel, but the signs of the struggle are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh Children's Garden, which was hit by a rocket, before the students arrived from the walls and rails.
"We have a little fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"It was difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire last week, thousands of people from the border communities like Saad left their homes or left their homes to move away from Gaza to safer areas and to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border to Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian morser grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is hard to draw from the Palestinian siege.
He urged the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire your knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an unlimited ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought about an immediate end to the fight; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the Hamas' demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the airport and seaports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battle.
A new round of indirect talks is likely to begin this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputes this statement and considers that at least half of the victims are fighters, however, there was no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fights on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and fights, the educational authorities moved last week to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school will soon be opened again so that we can learn more, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Sachsen: CDU-vise Strobl is infringing NPD-prohibiting procedures
In view of the loss of voting of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl spoke before the Federal Constitutional Court for an end of the current NPD-ban procedure.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl, the ongoing banning proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also head of CDU in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipzier Volkszeitung".
This is a happy development in the right direction and a development that leads me rather to the conclusion that we are fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
At the vote on Sunday, the NPD was almost at the rate of five percent.
A first call for a ban on the right-wing party was made in 2003 because at that time the constitutional protection was also available to informants at the NPD.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
In New Zealand, refugees are now being accommodated in tents.
The central first shot for refugees in Harburg is placed from all night.
Now the Home Office has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians were informed just before - they are a little excited.
"These Hauruck actions are no longer a threat to citizens' reservations and do not allow district politicians to participate constructively in the human settlements of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, president of the Greens Group at the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party calls for the district administration to provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 Refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overcrowding in the first survey are the distress of aid seekers - and the fact that authorities cannot provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
Household prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for households in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are operating a two-part market.
The figures of RP data show that household prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increase on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government expenditure and where prices increase only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr Lawless said that with the beginning of the spring now for the coming months, there would be an increase in the existing properties to be sold, which would be subject to the market "a real test".
"When considering the constant high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constant low interest rate, it is likely that the domestic prices will continue to increase over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion on the new press, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and certifies him to pose "like a fieldman".
The style of the university is not this, it says in the communication.
Thus, the Medau family was already informed "Mitte Juni orally about the intention of the university.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong," PÃ¶tzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preventions or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The extension of the narrow road to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus.
It was from a nine-metre wide road and it's not the talk.
It goes after the current state by 5,50 meters, which is a meter wider than ever," explains PÃ¶tzl.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and affordable parking areas will in future be used only by students at the university will not allow PÃ¶tzl to apply.
It is not parked at all because it can be solved intelligently, as in other public parking lots.
Think of the residents
The children's cripe BergwÃ¤chtel, which is located on the site and which would lead to access to the park deck at the front door, is not to be "injured", according to the president of the university.
Rather, he says, "that this is not only about the children's crippling here, but also about the residents at the inn of Friedrich-Strieb-straÃŸe and the 800 students of the neighbouring Real School.
So it is much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau," PÃ¶tzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the children's crippling, with the extension of the road would be entitled "to a "lost of the few natural spots of Coburg", "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, PÃ¶tzl, together with the State Building Bamberg, will inform the city halls of the construction development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new conclusion".
Last week, Pierre Medau informed the parents of the children's cripples about the plans of the university.
Therefore, the access to the new parking deck should not be as yet via the campus and Friedrich-Strieb-straÃŸe, but through the Medau-Berg.
This meant that the narrow road would have to be expanded to about a kilometer long by two.
According to the accounts of the Medaus, traffic in the Park of Castle Hohenfels would thus become more frequent.
From around 2000 vehicles every day is the talk.
On the side of the city, they did not wish to speak to the project until now.
Glandorf retreats from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Federalist SG Flensburg-Handewitt raised health problems for this decision.
I don't like the decision, it's been over for months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," the World Champion of 2007 told him on his Facebook page.
It is therefore going with a balance of 167 national games and 576 towers for Germany in international peace.
Because the powerful backspace player wants to go to Torejagd for the Flensburg Champion League for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the islander who announced his board on Tuesday for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as well as they will inspire my long-term partners and my successors.
But for my club, I would also like to be healthy in the coming years, for which longer regeneration breaks are needed, which does not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career after a Fersena infection in 2012.
Because of Achillesâ€™ problems, he had been able to deal with teammates of the German Handball Band (DHB) with a cortisone syringe that later triggered a strong inflammation.
A not operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor that the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career don't go through any body without trace.
I have some health facilities that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot operations that took place in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right into the grip.
This is due to some other pleas.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I did control my head, but I can't fool my body," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback he would only be provided in the absolute emergency.
"When all the strikes go off, I'm always ready to talk," said the double family father to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 I have also become quite humble as regards my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a few times.
In addition to the WM title 2007 and the win of the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the Europapokal of the Pokal winners with Flensburg.
German economy in the spring by 0.2 percent shrinked
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only the consumer lived the economy in the spring, while the investments declined.
The foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual increase in GDP for the first half of the year, a total of 0.8 percent increase in GDP compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste", which led the city of Burgmann for the first time on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of the Dutch "fietzenfÃ¼hrer".
The largest bicycle sports association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste".
This is about the largest bike tour through MÃ¼nster, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Hurene for the organisation of this tour through MÃ¼nster.
Written in various journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We come from the Light and are driven by night to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know MÃ¼nster in this way once more," the bikers are excited about the route through the Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld circles.
After registering in the Vereinsheim der SchÃ¼tzbrÃ¼derschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the Wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, continued towards Herenholz via the SchÃ¶ppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 meters, 120 kilometres with 1475 meters and 145 kilometres with 1775 meters, the riders proved their good condition.
They were treated on their way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Heinz LÃ¶lfing, chief organizer Jos ter Heinz LÃ¶lfing and mayor of Heinz LÃ¶lfing, were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all participants.
The organization passed without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz LÃ¶lfing draws a positive picture of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, what was probably the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in the year 2015 at the hopeful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the bikers promised to return to MÃ¼nster, and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which brought Konstantin Wecker, singer, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, in "Monch and Warrior" to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts.The Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote his memoirs, each chapter introduced by an appropriate lyrics.
And he's honest: From the Onanie as a gymnasiast to the shoplifting steel and drug use, he doesn't let go of human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellowmen.
Wide space also embrace abstract but more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all that he tries to go to the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his criticism of society, his political commitment - as well as how he not only expressed his music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his stay in prison.
Finally, Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also approached the ascetic monk, who was created "by abstraction", as he said, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
But there are also short anecdotes on the earth between all the high-spirited views: for example, about strikes in a local area frequented by GIS or a crazy car ride, where he pointed forward to a tree.
He's also very honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and his relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is concerned about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just stopped his voice: "Stop with the force.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went with him into the cage and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket blow.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this most serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a canister in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than his fatherâ€™s, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, reddish, deep sticky labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of noise.
My father used to lie in the bathtub and then he was slow to hear how he began to sing because he could wash the pipe from himself.
When I went around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him was growing.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents â€™ love.
My father never hugged me, he didn't say "I love you".
Only when it was bad for my mother against the end of her life will we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you" thing?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He's still friends with French, with whom he's been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That led to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled through this fitness and I also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career shift may be shown in his elegant, short-haired beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken from the theater.
It followed the comedy of the delusions, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have fulfilled his business life.
He was only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ found him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for a quite long time."
He studied in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine, while I was a television star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to play at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry introduced his Comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wanted it to never happen, but I don't believe I did it.
It was a distinct, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects with and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "yearly award-winning light column of British television" was also a "great parody of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that ridiculed the British black culture as well as celebrated, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on a mission in 1984, and in the nine-year-olds he was known among other things as chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles were touching his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels so bad, you just bring the time or you get a little better."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first result was Shakespeare.
I was usually allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and kept him mainly for a domain of the middle class, white in trombones and a head of coal in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it once.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry made 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of delusions.
Suddenly I was in the national theater and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance continued as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from stage to stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a theater, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Dutch Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the sights.
It also came to mind, so it's like a great sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a WOMAN voice.
So I'm staying.
I really love that.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry has still the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous outbursts, while he is constantly imitating people.
I have decided not to make stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for that, you're driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes act alive in the Apollo when I want to, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he'll make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I want to give it up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi-Rebels Block Streets in Yemen Capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital city of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi-FÃ¼hrer Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for action on Sunday.
Huthi threatened, according to the fact of the leaf with another escalation of the conflict, that his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The people's tribe of Huthi has occupied the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebel camps have been built on the great access routes of Sanaa.
In the rest of the world, there are still bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya is registered as an official in order to prevent "spirited"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to remove "spirit workers" from the government's payroll lists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government announcement said.
The government assumes that thousands of people will still receive payment after their separation from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised his entry into office in 2013, to fight corruption in the public service.
In a review at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 Â£) per month had been lost in payments for "spirit employees" and other abuses of financial practices.
The government assumes that fees will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear in identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been communicated in a government message.
All those who would not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "spirited"," said Anne Waigru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal against the art consultant Helge Achenbach is first negotiated on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil proceedings at the DÃ¼sseldorf Landgericht claim 19,4 million euros of Achenbach's damages and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was shared by a court-martial on Monday.
In the complaint it is said that Achenbach was engaged in the purchase of works of art and old-timers and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased worth 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of which he was the head of the school.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many standing Peterhauser and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worn by his efforts to see people in school.
The snowdrop is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive of his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/NordbÃ¶hmen, today Trutnov.
At age 14, he was interested in higher education after four years.
A year later, the Sudet Germans were honored.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern in 1946 - in the freight car.
That's how it dragged judges into the Upper-Frankan village.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week to the next train station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and go back in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a red cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951 he did the first and after three years of teaching.
Since Oberfranken had no free school for him, he applied for Oberbayern and attended the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "FrÃ¼ulein-Zimmer" was his first "service" in the school house.
In 1958 he referred to a three-room service in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Peterhausen-Kollbach school band and five in Peterhausen.
Since the school year 1968/69, these have been compiled in Peterhausen in today's Council.
When Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, then Principal Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Peterhausen grew up, and since September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to relate to today's construction, which was extended after Judge's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz, who also built a workshop at Community expense and in the 1997 extension of cellar spaces, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Citizen Master GÃ¶tz was very school-friendly," the judge recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the contribution of a government representative who had responded to a report from a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter focused on what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two kinds: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to find out, "It doesn't always work." Whether he only thinks of his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Justices did sometimes become unconventional.
When the students got scared, they didn't get about a job from him, nor were they destroyed to sit back.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two counterparties join each other, even if there was to be a fight.
For the sake of the school, judges maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
He moved the partisan judge after his retirement to apply for at least 1996 as the last on the CSU list for the municipality.
But the judge was elected in place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4 RADTOUR 700 bike drivers put in the Kurpark of Bad Salthausen and Shotten Interstopps
When Radler makes his tour in Bad Salthausen or Shotten Rast, that's nothing special.
On Friday, however, only the number of Rastenden impressed: the 700 participants of the h4-Radtour as well as accompanying tross enjoy a break in the lower spa of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Raddle and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and attended a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the bikers took the first step, the 60 kilometers across the city to Bad Salzhausen and further to Shotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed and the owner of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-DÃ¶ring, was welcomed.
For the refreshment of the body and mind, all kinds of good things were prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Lower-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, wreath, strawberry and cheese cakes that were wonderfully served by the skilled bikers.
"This kind of cake can only cook strawberries," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be created at the drinking level of the tournament Geits-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with well-known melodies from operas and musicals and excited applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
One gentleman added a head massage by his partner: "He earned it, finally he has re-established already jumped bicycle chains today".
Because the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drink shop by reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for bath salzhausen.
Also the promotion chief Tobias Hagen, since the first h4-Rad Tour 2004 as tour leader, was able to take a brief look, but he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees through three phones and a radio device and the 15-head motorbike staff of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from GÃ¼ÃŸen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westphalia, bikers are driven.
The number of participants is a little dependent on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
From the resort, the bikers had a good impression when they broke up after a half an hour: "Thank you!"
"It was nice in Bad Salthausen!" they cried out.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the radars were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a nice solid atmosphere and of course had prepared delicious cakes, such as flammable cakes with well-cooled poultry.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS businessman Markus HoÃŸfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his position as member of the board of the ADAC Hessen-ThÃ¼ringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for swinging under free sky was used zealously despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed with citizens who had been affected by the good mood as well as by the great crowd of bikers.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, WÃ¤chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalds - stood on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of radellns, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Twelve Turkish police officers arrested for "sworn" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to suspicion of "voiding against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the prisoners are 14 top-ranking policemen, HÃ¼rriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they allegedly had established an organised criminal association and hired telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities of the Islamic Spiritual Fethulla Gullen against him and others in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had been opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful anywhere in Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukow, head of school in Slavyansk, visiting Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will benefit them in their next life.
The first day of school in the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud reputation from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own experience.
Her career began with the world-wide management consulting company Bain and Co., which changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons' media.
She was the Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and withdrew when Pearson's senior position was attended by a younger male colleague.
Its discovery was estimated to have amounted to nearly Â£1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former president of BP, as she sought out more private knowledge in Whitehall: she was a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the president's task with a poisoned kelch.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two ways: after inside the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that requires a complete reform.
But which new president would venture to join in, start on everything and separate an institution that is as complex as a Chinese Dynasty, while he may even be involved in his own job.
It's a difficult task.
And if that is not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC less - power, money, and status.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is linked to special dangers.
For the modest amount of Â£145.50 per year, the British public is certainly buying into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC goes up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missing programs later on on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says substitute tweet was not authorized
A second from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a derogatory remark about the democratic district attorney, who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account, which deduces the previous one.
Just a tweet from my account that wasn't authorized by me.
"I don't save the tweet and deleted it," it said in the following message.
Employees from Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account went off, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavourable picture of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to tax in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, which led to an indictment against Perry - who might be a 2016 presidential candidate - in Austin this month before a Grand jury.
The text of the tweet says: "I don't always go drunk with the three-fold alcoholic mirror ... but when I do it, I complain to Governor Perry when he pushes it out."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and the prosecution called a political trick.
His high-class legal team requested the judge concerned to reject the charge and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas was unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and established in cases of government corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to retire.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed his presidential candidacy in 2012 at the Iowa elections, Perry went on speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at the jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley once again explains the apartment market for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction companies pointed out that the apartment market in the southeast of England is "returning" to normal level.
Ownerships in the capital were eager and subject to huge price increases, which led the Bank of England to set up ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit blast.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the Berkeley construction company, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal levels of transaction since the 2013 peak", adding that it offers a "stable environment of action".
The real estate market in London was well established during the divestiture as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Catasterum, prices in the city area increased by 18.5 percent last year alone, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, price and student offers increased by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April by Â£423,000.
However, a stronger pound has made real property less attractive for foreign buyers in London over the last few months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "will tax" in front of the general elections in the coming May.
London's real estate maker Foxton warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which more stringent credit transfer arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year in both real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in mortgage authorization in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the increase of real estate prices in London for 2015 to below 3 percent, based on an already weakening domestic price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen by a quarter a year, says the Maker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, since the amount due for the sale of time is more than Â£2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right well-planned product remained stable at the best locations and as a result time sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new properties in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual preliminary tax profit rose by 40 per cent annually to 280 million Â£, the turnover by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion Â£.
In a statement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley would be expected to meet the current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual preliminary tax result to be Â£450 million.
Berkeley shares were held at Â£23.96 on the afternoon of London trade.
naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscar Award.
Nock photos of Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panama" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "explainant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will be followed by all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were reportedly obtained by a leak in Apple's online memory system iCloud. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, a star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at pictures that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you're so happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "victorious" argues that in the photos about images of her trade and tweeted "These so-called nude images of me are GEFÃ„LSCHT, people.
Let's start at once. *Word game is intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a speaker of Popstars Ariana Grande detracted from her the reality of the alleged photos.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's high-sweet new novel about love and the letter "J".
They collapsed, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, distant and perhaps somewhat scratchy.
And then he shook his hand.
He knew Kratzburst.
He was sloppy, like in Igel, yeah.
The last victim of this impatience was a just beginning affair that was more promising for a relieving of the lonely longevity of his life than any other, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailin Solomons was a stubbornly delicate beauty with unsatisfied hair and a smooth heart from a village on the north island, which was even more remote and rough than the port of Reuben.
She had come with an older companion to the south, who held the cavern for her aunts, and who had inherited a piece of land in a moist but paradise valley with the fitting name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spins, nozzles had left their tracks on all the windows and believed that they belonged to all of them, and the garden was carefully monitored, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house of a babysitter, both dangerous and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on the broken benches in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had been spiritually absent in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and familiar news, when the sight of its cross-breeding brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer who his father had liked to listen to closed roller shops in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their genuine aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was so properly forbidden - simply not played.
It was successfully ossified, as the word ossified.
The general taste created what adoptions and regulations had never created, and how people in books choose the From Tellerwasher to Millionary Memories, Cooking Books and Love Romanes, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern started playing an imaginary piano and set great feet in a coarse serenade of Ailin.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"That was a famous song by a jazz pianist named Fat Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It was not a very fun game at the time, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew that this was what he expected, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailin had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played even though he was not directly prohibited.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "when" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be absolutely sure where they would end.
Just like the mind.
His unpredictability made the people nervous.
And Jazz was a musically expressive mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldnâ€™t remember a time when pops were not black.
Again, no laws or obligations.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society was due to the principle of group donation - thanks to the fact that they were expelled from the courtroom.
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and performed.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were like nature blessed with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the canalization; what was left of the Greeks destroyed counters.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents did not leave the country as quickly as they did when things happened, were afraid to be accused of being burned, even afraid that the flames would consume them as the next - had opened labneh and Shisha pepper restaurants, were concerned and were depressed with inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailin found it difficult to understand how the poignant words she had just heard from Kevern could be represented.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really harmful," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the sad feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound suppression of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailin still doesn't understand.
Why should your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something different.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She accidentally shook her head and blocked the sight of Kevern.
There was nothing else in the whole world but her ugly black beard.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," she said without any conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're making it up to me.
You seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet are not so straight.
Maybe your button, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my bones are too thick?
Do you hate yourself?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick jaws are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little pervert.
That doesn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because like his father, he did not have the calming charm that was needed to address the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevin.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomons became red and rose from her bed chair, threw the console around and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkness was no excuse for him.
In their excitement, they seemed to sit on like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel like I'm a pervert to you," she said.
Except I'm not.
She grieved him, both because of the unnecessary indifference of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she leaned on him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke down here like there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more tragic things to DEM that were when their ancestors were smugglers and beach robbers, dragged from knots to knots, always ready to raise hand against a woman who denied or mocked them.
Dickkopf?
They'd have shown her a thick faust if she hadn't been careful!
They first knuts - knuts was the most commonly used word for erotic attraction between men and women, a tribute to the unsaid loveballads from the console - they first knuts and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was unnecessary refinement, since the knot itself was an act of violence.
Ailin Solomon gave him a sign through her body.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt left out, but the wake of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They didn't know each other.
She looked at him as he was away - as from a room on the upper floor her companion was attached to him - a man who complained about something he had sworn himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, humiliated, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was this an opportunity that she seemed to know well if she could not remember the only time she had ever seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin looked at Solomonâ€™s feet.
Several years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked at a short lecture on the continued low and medium-level violence in exactly the parts of the countries in which their reduction, if not abolished, is expected to be the most in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of that violence.
"It has already been done much, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to weaken the native aggressiveness of a people who have led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically seen rarely in spite of the high-questioning church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be unresolved.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The people cry at the hearing of sentimental ballads, rely on stories about overcrowded difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still not only does the former silence hold the rural communities as well as our urban dispositions in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and sustained struggle at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to commit adultery," she said when she read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you Atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme answered Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme upheld her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Be quiet again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a pointless job.
We serve a society without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and commendable to themselves may at times distort the results you have presented.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "contained" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to go around what history is, if it is as if it were, it would have happened yesterday, that means taking the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head a flashlight in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Onnow had given to the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Smile on her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to the ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree to, apologize.
Languages are better than silence, the song word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want out of it," answered Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective as we are ourselves.
My concern is that without warning we may be able to find ourselves repeating the mistake that is at all only the one that is what is when it is.
But this time it's not the other time we let go of our anger and suspicion.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To show an English patience.
"They're going too far," he said, "if you call actions "errors" that may or may not have happened to our grandparents.
They go too far when you say that they'd let their "wrath" and their "mistrust" go to "other".
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From whom, if we are honest with ourselves," he warned Esme to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have good behavior.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good done what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to say anything about it - we agree.
And just as no blame has to be attributed, so no blame has to be imposed if such an action is appropriate and if there is a way to take it.
But what will happen to the past if we do not learn from it?
The past is for us to forget them.
If there's anything I can say--
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapsed.
"I'll think about her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was transferred by a motorcyclist who, as passengers described, had been driven on the road in a kind of "brutal anger".
There's an accident.
Lesotho-military member says that no state strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state strike against the government and said that they had taken action against policemen who had been subjected to the arms of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and reported that the army of the country had occupied its headquarters and government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting on threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no de facto State strike, but the military reacts to the threat by "political fanatics", whose weapons were managed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defence forces acted after receiving several secret service reports that were acting inside the police on some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just ahead of them to inflict destructive harm," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed to have attacked the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Speakers of Lesotho's military told Sunday that the soldiers would retreat into their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government while Thabane's absence.
Thabane told him that he believed that because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country, he had become a target disc.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane's parliamentary sittings because of disagreements in his union government.
He said that his actions would not have been unrestricted by the government, otherwise sound accusations about the face.
Production in the eurozone at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down in August at the lowest point in the last 13 months, with a very closely observed study.
The final market purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will meet before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect from the Bank a clear plan for dealing with the slow recovery of the eurozone and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week on whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by Britain and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at the market.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation of the bloc, France, fell to 46.9.
France remains a concerned child, as well as the rise in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer being reached, are also not satisfactory," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to affect the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the SME rose to 57.3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the sales manager index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone from August is that after that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone find life to be quite difficult at present, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence - and are likely to lead to some delays or even cancellations, in particular large orders.
He said that it would "always be more likely" that the ECB would finally have to introduce a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Decade of Beslan's survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children who are trapped in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people from Czech militias were taken to a school in Beslan in southern Russia as hostages.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom at the Groueltat.
Just a decade after the massive siege of Beslan's school, 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamic terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed them, it seemed to be the worst of the evil.
The tragedy united West and East in Abscheu, and then suddenly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom at the Groueltat.
We found amazing young people who have overcome the resistance, although the memory of these terrorist hells will be haunted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in children like them die - will end.
The girl who was photographed at the attempt to climb back into the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov, who tried only to climb back into her underwear after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused about her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both of them were kept dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I was going to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bleeding.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she was completely healed, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Your goal now is to become a dentist to help people as you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says camply.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the spa in order to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future class friend Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of each year becomes somewhat weaker.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I look online at the picture of me climbing back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and contribute to that something doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the bullet hole, in the opinion his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians going to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in his mother Tamara's arms.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lay down when there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearfully, she could be dead, he ran and saw on the way a crying little child, grabbed it by the hand and ran through a bullet hole.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out in the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was stationed outside and with bone injuries in the hospital, on her side assuming her son had died.
She said after reuniting: "I weep for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later fled to London (from the currently dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Bernardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow in my memory.
I still know that I threw away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the spa, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played in the court with who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the spa.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy stores, where I was able to choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I have helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and called for all local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with cellars in a restaurant. Damir shot his water gun at her and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war is going on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and still killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are tired or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for Rache, he is not overwhelmed by the past.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the spa and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he lay under it - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and looked around the hell, with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could have survived.
"I remember coming to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
George Ilyn, 17
The child whose terrible image has become the symbol of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan-survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood flowed face was marked by fear when he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbaria.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had laid him off for his first school day before she left to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intangible: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was preserved as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookstore.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People are always looking at such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they're investigating the destruction of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world is going to be something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing like that.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a couple of albatross dreams because of the siege, but then it got better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and was afraid every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I always go to the spathall when the 1st of September falls closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friend Tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the spa, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I won't get involved.
My life is going on.
I graduated this year from school and attend a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Faniow, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was caught at the feet of a killer terrorist
One wonder: During the siege, Georgij Faniew was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the spatial and sat next to the bomb, which was attached at the foot of a killer terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," said Georgi, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but this could not be done because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and then felt really better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the spa.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never go back there again and don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is unbearable and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine with my body.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, including the medical personnel, and they have answered that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the day of the year falls closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be even harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he has given me back. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something like this goes wrong.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he can't run any sports.
I'd say he overcame the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the murderers.
I know of families where new children were born, but also widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could it be that we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could seize and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajeva, 10
The baby that was so kidnapped by a special deployment command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is being secured by a Russian special deployment command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
In 2004, the world stopped breathing when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has married again and with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of passing girls on a walk to Fife
A 78-year-old man is standing before a court for a three-year-old girl on a walk-through in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving a girl on the passage to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states that Mr. Steward has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, contests the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set up the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both have for about $300.
I recorded these photos at a family party with several cameras that are all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery lid and other features are closed close.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have stage and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many won't hit.
Point-and-shoot cameras do not normally have an LCD with which to compose images.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the right picture setting is a lucky thing.
So you're doing a lot of footage.
If your camera has a row mode with which to make a series of photos with slightly modified lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is much more important under water because of the poor light conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed width lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill out the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in a giant organization like the NHS.
As a consultant, he devoted his career to the task of saving both the agony of the disease and the qualms of the treatment.
Among his patients, as his wife recalls, he was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors had an important role to play in diagnoses and diseases, while the doctors were mostly involved with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was making his wife Juliet impatient.
"I want everything better than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unconcerned.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he was skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray investigation were presented.
He looked at Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest, that is, the skin that is passing through the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is most difficult to determine.
While, for example, some lung cancer smokers have been sick, not all lung cancers have been previously smoked.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which once considered as "wonder material", but is now known as deadly.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is an illness that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - Klempner, construction workers, room workers and shop workers for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he does not seem to be concerned today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, as it seems, is experiencing today the peak of a messolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And Mesotheliom's joint is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And so Mesotheliom doesn't know classrooms, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are no protection room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos-suspensioned.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been developed as a starting shepherd.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a climber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like in the tunnels at the Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pfortner - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors trained at the Guy's Hospital and who have been sick to Mesotheliom for the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010 "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us are still going to get sick?
Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48 at Andrew Lawson.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still going to get sick?"
The leading British expert on Mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asthma epidemic in Great Britain is expected to occur, a total of 90,000 of the disease will fall to the victim.
Most of them still have no idea that they will die like this.
An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A brief look at the records of the courts to which the victims often refer because of claims for damages shows how far the mesothelimâ€™s fence has already been spread.
In June this year Marks & Spencer, for example, allowed Janice Allen to have been exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagshipstores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the mandatory.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought it would have happened to me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers, not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boile insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but the EU and the WHO consider it "a major health risk" with possible consequences of death.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it is clear but indirect evidence that this was the main reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed in the flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London, asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects showing that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma was caused without known exposure by work or at home by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our building.
It looks like no one can get away with being safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service cabinets and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be irradiated by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems as if the opposite is true.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace had received a "clean health insurance", it is clear now that Â£1 billion of work has to be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, the Members will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than at the Green Banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything you can do now is waiting.
A person who could never precisely determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abortion suspected that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I've worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints have been decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember at all places where you have worked and at the data.
What he still remembers is the day beginning December 2009, on which he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was running an operation late at night.
Suddenly, I had a gunshot.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest felt around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-ray recordings of his chest and set up pleurakathether to take fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now the connection does not end this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his house doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after the first time that Abbott felt sick, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I do most of the time simply," he says.
Honestly, I didn't even worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was a week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so now Mesotheliom meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) came in contact with the toxic substances with the highest probability.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals for the patients may have been life-saving, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still leaving today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have placed their buns on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently referred to on websites.
And that's why so innocent items in our houses like floorboards or shed roofs have been included by default asbestos.
"It is an industrial gift that is contained in much of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a woman in contact with her was that of a garden shop in the 1970s.
So be careful how you wrap up your garden sheds.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are huge.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelming he was from all the information he had to come up with.
"It was very hard to take everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor "how long have I been?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it then."
Mesotheliom is particularly domestic because it is our life-maintenance mechanism - the breath itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is dissolved and the fibers are inhaled, they can be attached to the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart doctor who switched to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspected was exposed to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some think she was worth a try.
Treasure won't do that.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Because cancer "on chemotherapy doesn't speak very well," which "shows effect", but doesn't heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for victims four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he happily introduced himself to calls.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, abortion had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months and likely prolong his life for only one month.
"I was disappointed," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart specialist at the Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred back, I just called and got a date," Graham said.
A normal patient should receive a transfer and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments are finally irrefutable, many are affected by another financial care - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of forgiveness.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was also a health risk.
And here the loyalty of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally contributed to their case, but it was not what Morgan called "full compensation", since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After examining his death, however, a spokesman for the Guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesothelioma patients who are trying to compensate for an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance claims may be lost.
And those who resist demands know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation in this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma victims to complain of compensation, even if their previous employers were no longer to find it.
The law has set up a fund of Â£350 million funded by the insurance industry for all diagnosed after July 2012 to prove a contact but cannot report to anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have addressed in a normal compensation process - about Â£120,000.
Some 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma victims that Â£350 million represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not passed and mesothelioma patients found the companies and could normally report them.
And Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, added that the law was "not perfect".
But both money and Morgan admitted that in view of seven victims of death, fast action is necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years with Lang-Lazdunski.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"Of course it's with the most important," said Abbott.
You see this again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you're going a lot worse.
Graham Abbott was involved in the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then in March 2014, I had a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumor is visible.
But the process is very physically and mentally demanding.
You have to think about practical things - about the money, if I'm not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boile line setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very friendly and rude.
She told her friends about it, and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was withholding.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to do.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not through hope, not from a trace of hope in survival.
The disease (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a terrible security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

Hong Kong refuses right to government election, demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong elections.
This process is likely to result in long-announced protests in Hong Kong business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization to this in less than an hour after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peing faithful candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
You have the inhabitants of Hong Kong angels.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants choose the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic break, because there is a direct right of choice for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership remains firmly in the hands of a tight nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
In addition, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be allowed after a new clause.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine general election.
On Sunday evening, within a few hours after the outbreak, hundreds of Occupy-Central adherents had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action to take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the establishment of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and there were increased security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The attractiveness of people from mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear of Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement as it threatened the business - the living part of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they will last," said legal expert Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to hear any fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The state-controlled media in China also reported recently on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school-leaving balls in the United States will now be transferred to universities where great performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this request and to offer the first luxury travel service of the United Kingdom to students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the University, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a safety component.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise had to cuddle their hazelnuts in a dangerously overloaded car across the country.
Together with our new VIP options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
One company speaker said that no new bookings had yet been made since the service had just been introduced, however, added that "Students would book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also announced that despite the study fees of Â£9,000 per year it expected a market for this offer.
Today, students differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with the VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as being dismissed.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start this month with the study are faced with a cost-of-living crisis, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and grants does not keep pace with the strongly increasing calculations for the simplest living conditions before they can think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticise race and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited for the baptism.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators place the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West rose and became noticeable throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shootings of August 9, personal essays with titles such as "thinking about Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not only about women's oppression".
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who are about the white and speak privileges in such a high-class manner," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but are not considered "women's themes" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
If I post something about how colors are under siege in their own country, then silence is overwhelming.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the themes of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hatty, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for election rights could only be successful for one group: women or black.
"They made the decision to apply for women's election, and the right to black should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, one with power is aware of why white women do not trust colored women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade until white women were organized against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women's sides, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions posed by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catches" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Would it not be great if activists who have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who are building up their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to remedies are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a scored article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, in which she called for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race, which are clearly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectoral feminism, in which race as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on race theme in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Chair Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stein's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's Keeper, insisted on helping vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship to the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the background of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police attacked almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform also came back to the surface - this time as a woman's theme.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a review of the topic as an essential issue, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the labour visa goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a hall in women's organizations," she said.
"Sweet House" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house standing for sale was removed by real estate makers, as it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for Â£120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig who had prayed his head on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"But the photo was mispublished and was now far away," said one of the company's spokespersons.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the earlier assembly house as "a unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the manufacturer has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
In the social media, house sales were of interest, as some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto winning
A Harvey lottery player is this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth is ongoing, with a happy winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaperskiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years took the jackpot in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still has to report.
Charger Steve Forward said the win provides conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks of nothing else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought such a win could happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated win in the first division last month, a payout for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved only a few weeks before the $7.5 million mega win.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first WA division this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only did the gladiators stand in the match at the first Rheinbacher romertag in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors to the event yesterday, who broke down the rainshows and the autumn cold and were left without any enthusiasm for the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of presentations, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator's "Leonidas" became a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men to the ring for a heroic match in various gladiator gagats.
At first, the "provocators" were on the line with right-hand shield and short sword as well as thighs on the left-hand leg and arm shield on the right-hand arm.
It followed the "Essedari" with chest shield, short sword and root, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiaius", which came against the "secutor" with thrownets, trizack and Dolch, and after a short battle struck the burrows to the ground.
Then the heavy metallic forces formed each other, the shield created and the roots flew surreptitiously through the arena, that a fear and bang could become about the health of the gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular judge, had a always attentive eye.
"We wanted to bring the Roman daily life back to life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, president of the event "Friendeskreis Romancanal", the intention behind the show.
After two years of preparation, an "oppidum Romanum" was found from the leisure park for one day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
Finally, not only did the Romans bring war and conquest into our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous constructions that we still admire today.
The remains were also to be admired on the day of Rome, such as "AquÃ©dukt-Marmor" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman canal bridge, which was just at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The Frontinus society faced water and energy supply once and for all, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the time".
This also confirms the diploma-Measuring Engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamTwo" from Rheinbach, who presented the measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hippokauste, the heat-heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also are the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the foothills of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Groundland Malcare at the Rhineland Landsverband had dug out the remains of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been found with a door to dry grain and milling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural asset, explained by archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass screen, including a large counter, several fine glass vessels and parts of a precious necklace.
The villa had probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the fall of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
In addition, the children were busy with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names as the Roman students once with metal grips on waffles.
At the stand of the Roman thermals ZÃ¼lpich the children could lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glass mosaics and at the stand of the natural centre Eifel Nettersheim serve a heavy wheat mill from stone to grind the flour for a flat break or a musli.
With the original refurbished Roman caravans built by two cold flowers, the visitors traveled through the leisure park and also passed through the impressive state of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Rome Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the town of Wachtberg will also be remembered in the year 2014 called for the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with the Hemisphere and Historic Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem will be offered, among other things, thematic hikes, a lecture, coking as well as guidance for school classes and remind of the Roman history of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman Legionary from his work on the Watchberg is told, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman times and offered a funny lesson in matters of folk understanding between a group of Watchbergers "Germans" and added Romans.
The Adendorf Primary School is dedicated to the theme of Rome within a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in the Watchberg are to be made visible again.
In the Watchberger Rathaus a small presentation will be remembered at the Fund of the Berkumer Matronenheligum in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemily Burdens the West African Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are neglected - and international companies are moving away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic brings the West African economy to a severe blow.
The crop rots on the fields that the mines are left and the markets are gone - the virus has put the region hard.
Some international companies are already moving away.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one," said African Development Bank head Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola are on the market.
Liberia has been hit by the virus most hard, and here alone the fever has fallen to more than 600 people.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease was advanced at every corner of the country.
In Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria too, the virus has spread.
A total of more than 1,500 people died, thousands more died.
Foreign firms withdraw employees
Wherever in the resource-rich countries, firms make up their own business.
Foreign companies such as the Steel Group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the regions concerned.
The domestic traders and farmers also respond: Only a few customers leave their homeators to get a backdrop.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export to the fields.
The farmers didn't dare leave their home for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Pariser expert for the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables remains at home.
The population is therefore suffering the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the stockpiles are floating on basic foods such as rice.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies threatens image damage - with far rich consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies are essentially avoiding the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugo from the French Think Tank Iris.
Determine how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression may arise that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest", says Hugo.
The disease also weighs on the country's stratified state budget
The disease is also a burden on the state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be stamped by the high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the vast region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already afraid of burning at home.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
The association "tannenwald" Bergau is celebrating its 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
At the Tannenwald Association, on high tours, preparations are under way for the 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12th, a large entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday at 6 p.m., the big baller shooting takes place.
Then he is in the big party of the moody evening with the "StoopfÃ¤lzer Spitzbuam".
Blascapelle provides music
The highlights on Sunday are the Feast service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large fortress at 14 a.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 women with their dirndln.
Hard chapel is the Blaskapelle Bergau.
The patronage has taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert FÃ¼racker.
The original term "Schutzenzellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through the exercise in the armchair and small-caliber shootings".
The NS regime had triggered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men were found again, who on April 30, at the Gashaus Lukas, raised the "new" association of defence "tannenwald" Bergau from the baptism.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the association as a gunman through a difficult start time in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the fall of 1965, the association of defences began in the "Leininger" guesthouse with two teams in the round competition.
In the following years, the sports shields, which were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes until 1st Gauliga.
The association records were cleared annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
As the performance of active protections has increased, so have the number of members.
After the association hall "Leininger" no longer meets the demands of a modern protection club, then the board, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future home in the cellar spaces of the new "Landgasthof HÃ¤rteis".
After a 2700-hour job, on May 8, 1988, Pafarer Strasser granted the Church's blessing to the new protective rooms.
One of the major highlights in the association history was the 44th Gaussian shooting, associated with the festive Christmas of the new protective flags in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Association of Defence celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Boller group was established in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became BÃ¶llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "BÃ¶ller" and the association as a whole was the orientation of the 2005 Bavarian Baller meeting.
In many hours of official work, the members of the association have modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in Bergauer Hof last year and thus brought to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competition
See also the sports services of the association.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round fights: six air defence teams, one air gun team, one sport gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (the highest league in the ANB) in the district 1 in the round 2013/14.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose from Gauliga North to Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as boxing, fascists and kingsball, Association Tour and Christmas tradition have been held.
This includes the shields at the parties in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about half the way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time, after his right front rowing took place in about 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now concentrate on running on the coming weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can do better there.
Stewart was already running early on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Bush and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I entered a good result today with pretty good hopes," said Johnston and added, "It just didn't fit."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an Aschenbahn race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He went back to his workplace during a study of the tragic event that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr.. He was on the road to confront Stewart during a race.
On Friday, the authorities announced that investigations into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart should be charged.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After starting at 12th position, Stewart was soon in the first 10 moves and was temporarily in place four.
After a restart in Round 122, Bush runs
Car with No. 18 except for control after the exit from Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to place 21.
Looking for dance-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-song-s
Simply try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and the leader Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to fighting.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV Jahn of the whole day are also creating schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups were greatly de-decimated.
Now enhanced growth is sought for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of 8 to 12 years old, six in the group of 12 to 15 years old," the 20-year-olds said.
With more assets, it would make the whole much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can enter the dance room at the former Meyer Hotel, FreistraÃŸe 9, on Thursday between 17 and 18 o'clock or Friday between 17 and 18.30 o'clock in the dance room.
"Training starts regularly with a heating program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore about classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, socialism is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies and we've already stayed in the dance room once," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and still do a whole lot for your own motor development.
Who isn't so jazz dancer, he can also sneak into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always sneak into the classroom on Wednesday in the children's/Jazz dance, Bambini ballet, videoclip dancing and hip-hop in the classroom.
The dancer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the Tanza evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who has a desire for Discofox, slow rollers, Wiener Walzers, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can pass and join.
Bulgarian prison inspectors protest across the country
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest before the judiciary in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher fees are also on a demand list to be discussed with interim justice minister Christo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for one month and calling for a return to the previous 24 hours.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations took place, the Director-General informed the BNR of the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The opposition of the prison staff is likely supported by members of the Association of Internal Affairs.
Ukrainian Army has given up Luhansk Airport
In Ostukraine, the prorussian fighters are still on the front march.
After serious fights, which were reportedly also involved in Russian tankers, the Ukrainian army has given up today, Monday, the airport of Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers have been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists take off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-russian separatists once again fired a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
About 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fights in the Donezk region, according to the Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard ships lowered
The rebels also claimed to have for the first time lowered two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the sender 112.ua.
Two crew members were missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the area of Donezk were under their control.
Diplomatic offensives in Minsk
The Ukrainian contact group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the Ukraine crisis by the planned stations in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was in line with the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a great mess" of the agreement.
"Today we need to see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, "they consider us to be opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed, according to official data, on new talks to address their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
There is still a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Due to the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last time, EU Energy Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also stop gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers to about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Power word: Mouth will "clearly come"
Now the Chancellor is clear about this.
However, it is not a free letter for all complicated details.
Hard-hearted concerns from the CDU against the Pkw-Maut have emerged from the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a Pkw-Maut after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To say it clearly: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU bodies in Berlin.
On a detailed model, however, Merkel did not fix himself first.
In the black and red government programme, it was called "certain parameters".
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal and is now being further developed".
The NRW-CDU, however, maintains on its No to a dead end on all streets.
Merkel stressed that also Finance Minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble (CDU) was constructively involved in the deliberations on a draft law.
In addition to the issue, he also spoke with Dobrindt about further possibilities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." On Sunday, SchÃ¤uble had left a mirror report uncommented, his house was examining its own concept to reward motorway investors with instant income - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
The CDU-Bundesvise Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never came out of meeting all the district and federal streets," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU President.
So it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Land Associations Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and the Rhineland-Pfalz.
There are fears that a delay affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seahofer had demanded a coalition line from the CDU because of the mud critique.
The left sees the plans in view of the dispute in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said partner Bernd Riexinger of the "New OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrendt wants to introduce a vineyard duty on all German roads to start 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under the Coalition Treaty.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the dead over the Kfz tax.
However, the model must not benefit foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One British woman said she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe walking and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from feelings of numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedrich-Ataxis (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are 51 years old today said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything took a long time with me.
I was never able to drive with the other kids roller shoes or skateboards and was often driven to and from school because of my way of walking.
Rodgers said that when she was 13 years old after several operations to relieve her Achilles and stretch her legs, she had her disease files in her hands when her doctor had left the room and read that she was lying to FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25 and in the meantime I would lose all my abilities slowly.
I did all this alone with myself and planted my own baptism.
She said when she was 17, she realized that she had not taken her abilities as strongly as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you've got it, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair now."
I think you've got something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT warning month to pay attention to this disease.
Stabbsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former training site
For almost ten years, no more shooting will take place at the former training site in Munsingen.
Even so, every month, deadly ammunition appears in the heart of the SchwÃ¤bische Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be pushed on site.
An oar-drumbling knuckle holds at the explosions over the heart of the biospheric area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the MÃ¼nsingen troop exercise site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectares of large area is the core of the SchwÃ¤bische Alb biosphere area, which is open on 13 designated routes for hikers and bikers.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, as a new study was published last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company's government and local tax burden increased by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year ago, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of declining decision 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre was a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery of the company's real estate values, researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three years that followed, with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these gains came from major countries such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be also to be in the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid more than $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the year.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues in Maryland, as the real estate taxes are running here on almost one fifth of the corporate tax decisions.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to offer the same services that other States offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies cannot only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, as the data do.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on State organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland introduced $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase equally in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 per cent on the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Virginia alone reported an average tax return of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax in all three official areas (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district at a relatively high rate of 9,975 per cent.
A comparable study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia there are lower government and local corporate taxes and that overall a better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The district was not studied in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the income tax rate of the State until 2017 to 3 per cent.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the Washington area, so they pay more government and local taxes, as the latest study says.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than total corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general multi-major income for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be recalled if the government's cuts in expenditure affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hoppen and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
Deutsches Bier enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, married in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - says the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the vice-secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again the official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned during the conversation on this issue of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, Warb Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to deliver German beer.
Hessian SPD President Thorsten SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would consult in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party bar in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines out to Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
After that, the officer from Guangzhou with SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel arrived - however, with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German art.
Tsingtao-Bier is married after the German purity offer.
More business transport
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice-Party Li said.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," said the municipal politician convinced himself.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow".
At present, travellers had to take the journey over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, the capital of Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire first in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," answered SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledger of Germany, nicknamed.
Maintained Partnership
Guangzhou's ambitious vice-partner hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not yet in this function.
He only came to the office this year after his predecessor was transferred from the office for corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration carried out by Chief Xi Jinping with rigour.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company in front of his career, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to his entry to Guangzhou, he worked as chief officer in Fujian, where the VW autobuilder built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km Guangzhou is one of those that are maintained on both sides, for example with a school exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the perflux is almost as strong as the whole Hessen with its economic power.
Next year she wants to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the dams"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was delivered to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has shown hope today that the 81-year-old comedian recovers from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a statement.
We're all pushing the dams.
According to her mother, sources were delivered on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors deliberately keep them quiet and under careful observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serest".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade today, more stringent environmental standards will apply in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1 on which the buyer can recognize central data at a glance such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, "Euro 6" sharper stick oxide values apply.
There is also more money for the farmers: they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 Euros across the country.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information he had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a number of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.4 billion (US$ 970 million).
The announcement is surprising because no one had expected to take over from Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was decided on for a cool billion thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their braure pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", says an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better water gives the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitter, so the message was that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch, something that was taken a long time ago, a textbook of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a puzzle why the deal with YouTube didn't come, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer sports than to watch, it is difficult to understand the attraction that depends on others to watch while playing instead of taking the control console in hand.
It's one thing to look at a friend at 3:00 in the morning over the shoulder while she's easy by Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spinner shooting him in the head 20 times in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so granting without own control over the perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.
I'm adding that the quick-passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as it's not a game or humourvirtosis, it's probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics know like me?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is as elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be recruited as advertising agents.
As Twitch's president, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gambling," and the media does not show signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as spectator sport.
At HÃ¼pfburg at the Burggartenfest, some were off on Sunday night.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the castle garden.
In time, the input had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
In two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedel castle garden is supposed to shine light in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors opened themselves to the Open Air.
A feast for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And that is what they have succeeded.
Around the supply facilities on the Burggartenwise it had made salt Wedeler, but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wading with the foot in the pace, enjoying cool drinks - in short: relaxation pure and pleasure were said.
And that's what happens to the generations.
While one on the top of the decks was swimming on the beach bar, others were swimming on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the growing up at HÃ¼pfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when children were being made, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the true sense of the word to become the Andrang Lord and to enchant fantastic creations in the small faces.
The larger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot Crew of Salt Wedel directed.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he pushed visitors down, especially families looking for the width and the dryness.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not break.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all over the line".
That is why there is no opposition to a repeat of the great party next year.
Although the contents and size of the event still have to be worked on, Shem made clear in a first balance on Sunday against the people's voice.
He was angry that the entry had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company was booked with too few forces.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the saltwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who wandered into the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke down its performance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt Weld because of a tire.
"But next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Air was more than successful among the visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes that will be made for the first time, but have to be eliminated for the second time.
The social network of Facebook also needs to be criticised by the organizers.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says El Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so close.
I find it very good that some not only foolishly chat, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hut off!", writes Stephanie JenÃŸ to Amula.
Now there is a year for the organizers to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's scarf
That is not what we expect.
Instead, the ready part of the building is waiting to be used in the remarkable construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA Space Observation Radar, the so-called Radom is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size, however, still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new hole is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old hole is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new hole is set up.
As long as the weather plays, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
A participant in the Ice-Bucket-Callenge will be thrilled by Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went down painfully.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had cried so much at the Ice-Bucket Callenge that she expelled the chef.
Isabelle Roberts, from Britain, screamed so much when her cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I yelled, and while I did, my jaw remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is protected over the age of 20.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work out, the chef was locked up, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost got into the pants before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the United Kingdom was transferred to the hospital to allow the chef to reinstate after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Do the castles soon pull back on a string?
Finally, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfrathausen castles.
Now the board is thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfrathauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolfrathauser Burg friends, launched the project in the French GuÃ©delon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgveyâ€™s friends Wolfrathausen.
The views expressed so far seemed to be different as to how the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction should be dealt with.
Now the two camps are moving together: there will soon be discussions on a common procedure.
This is confirmed by the association presidents Torsten SjÃ¶berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burg friends) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we should get together once," SjÃ¶berg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could go back to one line in the future.
This is how faster visible success is to be recorded.
While the prisoners were looking at Richard Dimbath's sudden death, until the last time they had a reconstruction of the castle at the Bergwald, the "extreme and experience" of SjÃ¶berg is at the forefront of the castle.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the prison friends, was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in front of the prison friends.
A new president is to be found at a meeting of members in mid-September.
At the moment, the association has about 40 members, according to 74 years of age.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the association activities rest with respect." This "desk phase" was necessary to "think how it could go".
According to Piffl, the new president will then go to the conference with the Burgverein.
Until then, the prisoners could also make an up-to-date mood picture within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency yet, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He doesn't want to run because he has his residence in Bad TÃ¶lz.
The new president should be a tungsten houser.
The TÃ¶lzer wants to work on the project "but would like to continue working".
The different positions in matters of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He praised Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Through high participation of the population as well as voluntary aid from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to proceed with the project. A "all-purpose feature" could be created for the river city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction personally overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something at this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is "is important and good".
Then you could go on with it.
Clever ways to save on uni textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students amounts to more than $1,000 per year, the student Matt Schroeder considered himself a smarter sparidee.
He invented a rental system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-file-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attends the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent 120 bucks.
The board of directors informed the students on average that they spent more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there were different cost mitigation options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, has been sharing that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Investigations in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookstores in the last spring semester, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased from the National Association of College Stores in Campus bookstores.
Here's the only one for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books online cost only one third of the price for which they have to be in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be referred to for $239.99 in the specialized bookstore Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If the notes of other or normal uses do not make up anything, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was resold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenditures would be allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for part of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you sometimes treat them well, thinking about giving them back and don't want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself of the business rules you are renting, including the penalties applicable to the writing of notes, reminders or traces of use.
Renters carefully: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc...
At Chegg you can rent "calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Take a look at each case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, as Gault says, whether the book is really predicate.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had delivery time for four weeks and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy didn't become a cashier
"The Expendable 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his $90 million budgets in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The movie "Sex Tape" on Cameron Diaz only played $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films like "silver-made 2" also disappointed the revenue.
An article by Telegraph Film Criticist Robbie Collin suggests that children's films of lack of quality may be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "lightly made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in the case of films for a slightly older target group, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compares the average CinemaScore and Metacritical rating for each summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvas walls.
The results were based on the opinion of the cinematographers and film critics and showed that this year's film hits were equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming services such as netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-appearing jungle book film, said against the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash flow results of Hollywood production, netflix has recently achieved sales with current streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for focusing too much on comic filming and prophecy times a "nuclear meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current deviation, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy can contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as simply "cyclic" and said against Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema, and nobody will worry anymore about the business."
Some years ago, when the 2nd class of table tennis was removed for the purpose of punishing the league assembly, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has introduced an additional 3. Bundesliga into the programme.
The consequence: Whoever does not climb is ladderd down.
Thus GÃ¶ttingenâ€™s top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Religion has avoided the descent, but in the coming season only plays five-class.
Torpedo women remain fourth-class, despite their grand journey to the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in Lower Saxony, as well as the boys of the SC Wend.
The SG Langlers and the Torpedo Reserve join in the new alliance league, in the Landesliga are no longer represented at GÃ¶ttinger Clubs.
In the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Associationsliga, the second Torpedo in the Landesliga.
What of the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga south.
Here are TSV Sailingen, VfB LÃ¶dingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Enbeck, Hammenstedt, Topender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league they play as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district council of the ladies begins at least in absolute strength.
GÃ¼ntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarhausen are running in the district league.
With nine teams
The SC Wende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district staff of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Superior SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two GÃ¶ttinger Circles begin with each of the nine teams.
In the West Staff are the Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Langlern II.
In the East-Staffel, among other things, sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarhausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfhausen.
The Women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarhausen II, Bilhausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle, where there are no women's teams on the circuit level anymore.
Assuming that no one in the sixth grade reaches peak strength, the innovative and circular board will have to think about it once.
Nato Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of opponents of the Nato Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following us on the weekend and talking to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridge to Belgium.
Teenager from the Blue Mountains
WHILE young bus hikers were put in safety with the sail wind after they had been trapped in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke up on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 20 o'clock when the two didn't come home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple were found near the Bridal Veil Falls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had injured herself on the knee and the man had been beaten and hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they were blown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a car to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Scale government-friendly protests in Pakistan
About 1000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that those who had been equipped with pieces of demonstrators had damaged devices in the editor.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the chief of government to whom they have cast their ballot.
The police reported that about a mile from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence had come back on Monday to meet some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to force Sharif's residence.
You are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without violence".
It further stated in the Communication: "The Army remains committed to ensuring the security of the State".
The escalating violence has caused anxiety before an intervention by the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests by opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have been taking place since the independence day on 14 August.
Sharif refuses a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called their supporters on Sunday to stand up.
"We will not return without forced Sharif to retreat," Khan said.
Qadri made a similar statement.
Khan proposes that Sharif have won the parliamentary elections last May by fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government.
The demonstrators had first peacefully endured before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them at the weekend to move Sharif's residence.
HÃ¼tteldorfer after the second season victory in place three of the table.
With the 2:0 overgrave, for Rapid, a biter week on Sunday ended a reconciliation.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the Europa League on Thursday had reached an intermediate stage.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and TorschÃ¼tze Steffen Hofmann, who presided with green-white in place three.
Schrammel-Tramtor brings Rapid to the Victory Street Rapid with the second season victory has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience into the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his wonderful leadership volleyball, won the victory in the 14th minute.
"I thought I had all the hunger from Thursday and rushed it under the latte," the 26-year-old laughed.
When Schrammel met in a federal league for the last time on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first racer in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid-Earth," Shrammel said.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term beck and bluster, he fell from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position in mirror traffic.
The door he earned, he has already made some assistants today," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flag to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour that finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests would have been able to write.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," noted Schrammel, who, in this way, played on the breakup of performance and result in the last few weeks: "The results didn't vote, but the player was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that you had been "in many games before today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this season at this stadium".
The first three points since July 26 have thus proved that the team's body is intact: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less happy for him: "That we have finally played zero again".
A lot of work during the country's break also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have reported several accidents, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philipp Schobesberger gave their debut prizes, making the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," recalled Barisic, who lost in the past three days with the injured and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
Therefore, the country play break had to be used to "Leak wounds and put a little bit in the physical area", explained Barisic, who has five U21 ex-electors in his ranks.
One who is likely to find the break especially located is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes through pain.
Just in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic observed.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 above the Admiral).
Hofmann: "You mustn't believe that everything is good now" "We must have had some luck, but sometimes the happiness has to come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time," Hofmann said.
He freely reminded of concentrated work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played so bad in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we must also not believe that everything is fine now.
He couldn't fight the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can really help right now.
They are holding on to me at certain stages," Hofmann said.
Grand Coach Michael Baur had little to do with his team.
He regretted the fast opponent "out of the category Magictor", as well as the regular door of utility in the 40th minute, which was misbehaved by arbitration colleagues.
The only suggestion I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough in some phases.
There were too few conclusions.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It just started bad, but then we found it clean and even made a door.
There would have been more in the whole of it.
Under this wiggle, peace reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle work the summer series "My piece of RhÃ¶ner Hluck" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the countryside, the illustrated specimen is the "GieÃŸruheiche" above underweiÃŸenbrunn.
A step-by-step leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes to groups, basalt rocks and basalt rocks.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it looks more like the other trees of the surrounding area and remembers with a range of more than eight meters to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intense research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has additionally consulted the Bishopsheim Archive and asked older people from under-white wells to find out what relationship it has with the geistreich.
The result of his research remained the very clear statement for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goats were supposed to have driven their animals from under-white wells on the hard - worked and rock - free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal huts that have been exhausted from the climb are to rest.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the plains they actually feed sheep again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biospheric reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, because the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place of residence for cruisers.
A hiking trail leads from underwhite fountain to the tree, which is hidden.
Other paths are paved up, the direction of HochrhÃ¶n climbs up and invites you to an extended walk.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is being searched for in our next task is rather rare to find.
The mirroring in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the countryside to which the building can fit.
Where is our "piece of RhÃ¶n's luck"?
My piece of RhÃ¶ner happy

After weeks of training, Italy's Prime Minister and EU President Matteo Renzi implemented the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit, she will become a successor to the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government's newspaper La Repubblica reflects the appeal of Mogherini, who is also a favourite member of the government, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Finally, Renzi hopes that the left-wing party against him will continue to be calm, because Mogherini will be assigned to this one - even though it is rather moderate -.
Against the conservative representatives of the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and of the Polish President Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome will be to create political compensation.
Because the EU's Head of Diplomatine will at the same time be the Vice-President of the Commission Juncker.
The remaining consent of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have referred to the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as a "significant recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that, for almost two decades, Mogherini has proved successful in leading party offices and has been known for her zeal for the "great challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her career as a party began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then-democratics di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined the Margherita Catholic Central Party in 2008 as part of today's social-democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Youth Socialists).
With the 2001 election in the Left Democrat Party, she joined the high party policy, worked in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader soon became her leader.
She occupied the traditional focus of Italian foreign policy like the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO use in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, and maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mogherini.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in the PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share.
Therefore, there is a lack of substance in the PD in Brussels, which the new EU foreign commissioners have too little diplomatic experience.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltics, mistrustful realistic accent Mogherinis is being persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and is being denounced as a "rousland-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, to be transported directly to South Europe via Russian natural gas, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi had served as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first visit.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with enthusiasm, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new staff will work in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechanicals (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the province of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas BÃ¼cherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Reuters from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neuunburg from forest, Felix Domaier from Oberwiechtach, Daniel Sorgenfree and Sebastian Zahner from Preimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainers visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees from all years of age and trainees go to a team training event in Oberamergau, where, among other things, a whole day walk and rafting on the Inn is on the program.
The company consists of 435 and 950 employees worldwide in Germany.
The number of trainers distributed over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "hold their mouths and bring France in order," said Francois Holland's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply fragmented link to show "your love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet formation has been attacked by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said in a loud appeal.
As a depressing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands to lock down the regulation of the pages of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande called on his fellow socialists urgently to "counselise" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, fought in the motions in which she took part at a meeting of abstinent Socialist MP and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, slowed down the constant graffiti of the Socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Walls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls has no choice either, they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Fraulein Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call after a resolution by Parliament and said that she was confident that she would proceed as a winner in pre-election elections and be ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French feel that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Science Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and the unemployment rate.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with prestigious cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruiser, conducts advanced negotiations to acquire the competing prestigious Cruises International Inc for around $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its well-being while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end in vain.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company based in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, acts under the brand name Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is totaling about $29 billion, and in the coming years it will be expected due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruiser owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested $1 billion 2008 in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together have over 82 percent of passenger capacity in American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the exchange of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-true group swam the Chinese flag in the vicinity.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is likely to be occupied with peking faithful members.
This decision will almost make it impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and forced pro-democracy activists to face their threat and to lay the financial square of Hong Kong with "occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy will expand to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which presented China's leadership over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on the electoral process in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the business district of Hong Kong and a sit-in was organized there.
Lis survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the leading office.
Until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong did not see any democratic elements.
Putin demands from Kiev the admission of "state talks" with the Ostukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against separatists in the east of the country and engage directly in negotiations on the "statehood" of the region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status vis-Ã -vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev Government for negotiations on eye height with the pro-Russian rebels, however, is in line with the strategy that he has apparently followed since the outbreaks five months ago: help for separatists in the admission of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to become truly independent for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recover the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were adopted in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary splendor of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, during the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26th and while government groups of civil communities are attacking the areas held by separatists, hope to "get caught in their illusions", itar-Tass reported.
"We need to engage immediately in detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of the society and the state status of South-Ukraine, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, should be seen in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at stake.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesperson for correcting Putin's "error interpretation" remarks underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, unlike the direct annexation of the Crimean, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have been much more difficult to attach to the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys of the time before the conflict have resulted in a large majority for the rest of Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats to international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state to crime.
The peninsula, which was annexed five months ago in the Black Sea, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and castings that make important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, in his speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislation - after elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, which would allow for greater control over their finances and the status of languages in the respective areas.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armaments and incitement is cast down by Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders at eye heights followed a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks had invaded the former peaceful region along the Asian Sea in eastern Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the armpit, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
This is why massive civilian and military preparations are under way to secure Mariupol a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tankers and 1,000 soldiers entered the Danube region last week to support the camped separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reported on Saturday in Kiev.
On Sunday, Lysenko reported that the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were involved in the Russian invasion of Ilowwajsk were exchanged against 10 Russian parachutes captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Nock photocandal about Australian promises and Gabi Greek
Geoffrey Edelsten did not heal his anger about hackers who probably stole the head pictures of his fiancÃ©e Gabi Greeko and a who is who the A-Promise from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking canal about promises on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this probably has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevenne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski, and Greeko from Melbourne reportedly also made private photos because of an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
The most noble man who had engaged Greece last month said against the confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Greece, at the time in New York, reports said according to a news site that the hack was "disgusting" and that the victims felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is located in a pool.
Among the film works of Palmer are "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahowski and the actor Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence said against TMZ: "It's a terrible breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th Radel on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the Association "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour, for which one was a torture, was an easy training for the others.
But in one they all agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the chief of the brewery drove with the wheel on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good.
He can easily hide the small muscle catheter, especially when he was involved on the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg for the benefit of the Association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - fine!"
Small peaches on the way to the Applauscurve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper Town Parliament, many of the 718 participants went to the mountains yesterday in the morning and came close to the collection, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to cross the good eleven kilometers long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman DieÃŸner, for example.
The whole Green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - did something more on the subject at first ("Every amount of professional, there is the goal!"), but then on the mountain proved to be half professional and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breath.
He also crossed the route in a rutsch, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokesman of the city of Oberurssel, who had been on the road with Frank GrÃ¼neisen.
For the two triathletts, the Fieldberg-Radeln was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is Charity, we'd like to go with it - we would certainly have made an excursion today," Kukhn said.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down in the morning to the top of the room to narrow it back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung in the sattel at 9am in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun also had "Fritten-Toni".
For the chief of the upper cult church, cycling tours across the Feldberg are easy.
He had been on his 6.5-kilo-Rennrad 40 minutes.
It's a crazy thing.
For this purpose - I am pleased to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The coached mainzer says he's an "an ambitious racer."
It must be because he was on his way with the "Fixie-Rad", which is also racing bikes, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed up the white wall and the fuzz stand at the top of the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a tire with weights behind a rope on a rope.
Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said: "I know that" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special ski trail, only that he holds the ski lift himself." So the man is certainly his own ski dog.
The 718 participants - and as many as ever - were sent to groups on the route in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
It followed the first bikers and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain biker was released.
Bent Hansen, president of the association "Radeln on den GroÃŸen Feldberg", gave the starting commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For the next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
