It seems to me to be a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the assumption that it is common in the rugby is of no importance...
Yes, we don't interrupt Muslims' prayers and we don't break a person's nose during drinking games (at last, unless it's part of the game), but we've actually painted in black for some fancy evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first year students seemed quite typical to me.
That said, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond myogynistic jokes and jokes on alcohol that are often associated with university rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to achieve the maximum.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your injuries and your stereotypes interfere with the facts?
I imagine that the LSE rugby team is populated by former students from these schools for which the competition rugby is a tradition.
In other words, old boys from the private.
Out of very different environments than those who play rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So are the "misogynous jokes" acceptable?
It would be like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races through campus, flight, property damage and misogynia were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body is part of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win in serenity.
therefore also ancestral this interstellar cloud (ouf, not traditional:))
@lux You didn't read the article well: a small half of the water of your meal is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yeah, well, we can all of a sudden even if we consider that the fleet of pasta has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not already so bad that it is
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophes and warmers of all the skin that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
An irrefutable evidence that heating stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon toopo: What evidence is there that the heating stopped?
I don't see the connection.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological problems.
It is not a question of "catastrophes" as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans, but rather about the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know the soft water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not climate heating that is the most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly gourmet lifestyles.
With regard to the study that you quote and which you make the generous effort to quote the source, of course there is little doubt about the truth of the conclusion.
With regard to freshwater problems, I assure you that the French are far from being concerned xD Then we need to stop considering the ecology as an unfailable dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is being referred quietly (estimation 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
Yes, the ecology is religiously dogmatic and unreasonable, not thanks.
"Then we need to stop considering ecology as an unfavorable dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is being referred quietly" Yes, it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate heating is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A seal that by oxygen action will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of closing exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the least sign indicating that 10,000 gentlemen would have come on the ground to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
I'm sure not!
In the small brain of Abbott, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're moving on to rebounds, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model would give priority to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flower worldwide.
It would be said that this scientific fact has never been established.
Have you seen the army anywhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
The CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument about the food of plants is only a fallout.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms Wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials may be carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is false and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was most beneficial, it is now investing where it will receive the most publicity to make the Liberals return to marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the prize of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants produce less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people need to eat them in a much larger amount to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this Member is a man of power is obvious.
Until now, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from breaking the 17th rule.
However, punishing him and not Thévenoud is incomprehensible for the evil of the world, even though the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That this lady is doing a whole thing is not to her honor, it seems especially like history.
If Mitterrand had put all those who were speaking Mitran into trouble...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academie" had been exhausted: "Let's tell Mrs. Sceaux's guardian or guardianship" (post that had never been occupied by a woman before).
It's just magic!
"The political arena" ...!
The sandbag, the rear-court of the Republic fills, the marigo of the opera guillants, the picture of the illusions, etc.
But the arena is supposed to be gladiators, people who take real risks, good pleasure, bad pleasure.
Qd the Phallocrate Umpiste sits on the label and parliamentary regulation by turning to the + elemental civility under the false paraplegic ways, the sanctions apply to him "quality" for his partisan will and his masuse of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making a provocation to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, he may now be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The Academy is back and it's seen that Members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to address its internal problems and stop causing cowards and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you tell her what she doesn't say.
This Member is acting as a college in the early years, which provokes provocation and whose friends are going, in delegation, to see the Chief to cancel the hours of gathering.
And defending it on the basis of a scripture which they have not even read.
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this UMP Chamber.
Mr. Judge, I appeal to two expert witnesses to separate a few thousand years.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dolphins, otars, horses, they do all the stupid things for the simple pleasure that this brings them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we are spending the majority of our 80 years working, moving and making stores.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lifetime, but we spend most of it in boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that anthropomorphism is.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
In addition, the "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go looking for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that we hear a lot of gossip about animals that are "playing" while they are just communicating.
Perhaps the game is not only "useable" (it may or may not be), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of play based on any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped him" Maybe he had the hope of living...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be in good health and to be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to react at least 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite enthusiastic about those who seem to be crazy at first.
But when we see what many have retained from their education at school, especially among the most likely audience to commit themselves to aggression against women, my enthusiasm does not find the least beginning of attachment.
"the most likely public to commit aggression against women" We would like to know a little more about it.
Or rather, no, it's good, we got it right.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even if it doesn't necessarily match your thinking patterns.
True, the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's disappointed youth too!
If the grids were no longer responding, Twitter would no longer be able to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I didn't learn anything from all this at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not in my intentions).
Should I love luck?
Unless I had parents to teach me certain values....
The family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do we start reading life when we don't know how to read?
And is it that young socialists go to banlieu schools to teach equality between men and women?
It would be more effective than making moralizing installations on Twitter, but it would be necessary to get out of beautiful neighborhoods...
Great with this campaign.
They're zero everywhere but to teach moral lessons, that's the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke about using his bread.
This week's article doesn't go soft.
It's not time to make jokes around the bread, my boy!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double meaning word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How do you get the more you pay, the less you get in the seat?
Because the quality of the experience is not necessarily measured at the weight or the number of calories, as is the quality of a film or a piece not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a monk?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more plates.
Of course it doesn't have to be like that.
The Sportsman at Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay, the more you have the chance to receive a child's share with art in your ass.
At least they've made an effort to get nappies.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good dishes?
Is the Manif for everyone just a Catholic and Muslim movement?
Yes, it is: a kind of homophobic assembly.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "child manufacturing".
A child must not be raised in a battery lift or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery lift?
Where do you get this?
And if you respond to any technical intervention in the "manufacture", you must demand the ban on LDCs for heterosexual couples, it would be worth the consistency.
I am also surprised that the manif claimed "for all" did not yet have this logical claim to his attractive catalogue.
it is true that it is not the only cathos that manifest: the other religions, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
It is still useful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was violently opposed to the desire of gvt to admit girls to school in the name of "the defense of the family".
We're still in the same schedule.
And, more recently, the same currents have watched the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be granted to the positions of these people.
No need to be catho to become angry with the marketing of the guts and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops from the other: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have both the right to love themselves and others.
But it's not a matter of tolerating that the child is a furniture object.
And this is also valid for the heteros seeking GPA.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the balloon and could avoid pudding moments of stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
Furthermore, I am sure that any other attacker, other than Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have marked if he had been given more than 42 selections on national teams...
I cannot disagree, at least categorically:) Since this article speaks of the goals he has set out, I will not talk about the other things he brings, especially in ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't bring or bring anything), but perhaps that would be another reason why he got much more often than, let's say, Peter Crouch.
Bothham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 It is the way to criticize Rooney at this moment so you can be forgiven for doing so too.
This says it is good to take into account that since signing with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and takes 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 crucial steps in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its estates on the ground are excellent.
On the other hand, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridicule it.
I'm obliged to ask myself if you really look at the foot or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would mark so many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticisms about Rooney's capabilities come from as a football player.
The hardest thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's football qualities (even not attacking) to Peter Crouch's?
Are you doing this without laughing?
There's really a whole lot of people.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the front-centre machine for the purposes of England during his career as a team of England.
Instead, he played the previously withdrawn role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind such players as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch as mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You've been forced to write that down.
In a country where the port of arms is tolerated and in a state where 71 per cent of people have a weapon, I find this completely schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to proceed.
And well, those in this school are not exactly in agreement with the U.S. weapons port authorization!
The use of the skull is still suicide.
Stop at the corner: the girl is 5 years old.
How many guys play with real guns at this age at home?
Is that actually the killers in power for so much?
Although the port of arms is in the U.S. constitution and this has a strong influence on the country's culture, I do not believe that the roots are significantly different from ours.
A little good sense and reason saved svp.
It's a disarmament process!
Make yourselves clear!
Information on this fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has or does not have any prerequisites for the taste of the morbidity.
Could we start with the principle that a serial killer may not already have a bizarre behavior at the age of 5 years?
If people need a psych follow-up, it's more the mabula of this school than the students!
Let the parents take their dog away from there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely ill.
Your response is much more relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
Your relative youth?
Those brilliant blue bastards that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson carrying at the beginning of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar was wearing a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson was wearing a wheelchair.
I can't comment too much because I've never seen this before, but it all seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Oh, contrary, maybe?
But what a depressing air!
You got ahead of me.
I would have thought that a lean knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostracise", he meant "foreigner".
That would make sense.
No, I thought that was what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
Worse still, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and that Sugar wore a grey suit, we could move forward that their intention was to ostracize it.
But here, no.
It would be said that this has been corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Probably nothing, but someone just wanted to quote something...
Thus, the word used in the article was well "ostracised", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still fallen by about 6% in August.
Ever since 2001.
Fuel prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is constantly strengthened.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
In order to live there at this point, I would say that the United States is gradually approaching the explosion as inequality becomes crazy.
The political system is literally driven by the state of funding for electoral campaigns.
The racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an extent that is not imagined in Europe, but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their countries and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, English financial institutions said France was lost.
Now it's America that's at the end of his roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forgets the essence.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and billboards couldn't give the change for a long time...
Based on the depletion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "drink" or die.
I can't blush this Farrage.
Will the Labour Party finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing foreign-sponsored voters makes it lose even more support?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Shameful performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, this is played by 617 votes.
About Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that the Blair government's massive immigration policy was designed "to provide the right nose in diversity"
The Labour win the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in safe seat against ukip = Crisis Labour Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it is the same multiculturalism that has led to this return of maneuvers, the pendulum has spread very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that it will now divide into the other sense.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Labour Security, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who isn't in the disgrace knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it is a victory at Pyrrhus.
Search for the word "victory" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "defect", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a victory, but she's skinny.
The Labour should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent to any gain in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not there.
Of course you don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know how hard Canada, Greenland and northern Russia are.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc should not also be considered?
In general, we need to see the Earth more “pasteur ” or malignant than we can imagine.
Is that right?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a "simply mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the ground floor, the pressure on the mantle relaxes, which gives/would give a) a blow to magma production b) while facilitating its access to the surface??????
In any case, either the "cut-off" or the ease of access to the serant surface (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As regards climate heating, I think it is prudent to focus on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, Patricedud, does this volcanicism have any effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate warming, the future or the past?
Isn't Prudence getting warmed up?
When complexity cannot be resolved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe it.
Yeah, but also, when it's nighttime, we see better.
Hello, the end of the last ice period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain ranges where on the highly frozen continental sides of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordially CB
It is too often ignored that the earth's crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon causes it to mount or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, in different ways, according to its passage into the zenith, as it does for ocean waters.
This gives that the smoothing of tectonic plates, like the seams, is more or less facilitated by this moving bush, as the polar shells are alleviated by the source of the ice, thus causing a change in the balance of land to the equator, since the volume of the land remains constant.
I am am amused by this "human", calling himself the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, to be ridiculed for his stupid action on the environment that created it and which has become so separated that it has become harmful to him and to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who surpasses it in the organization of its own visceres, by an invention that consists of finding all the means possible to dominate its neighbor, each other, laughing at the collaboration, the money.
The earth's crust is not based on magma, but on the earth's mantle, which is made up of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at it.
Pretentious and arrogant.
That reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful Wild1 story
Rather, it reminds me of a completely brilliant 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
It's a shame you've never gone beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
"The Ice Ages, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thanks Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been realized several times, they are still going to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian "miles air" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to make eyeballs in front of a brain in a mouth.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's all.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a Marxist compass?
In fact, it is the individualist identity that we see today.
So she needs to be herself, so she doesn't.
Of course, but Descartes is also present at the time of the event of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this event.
But at this time it is just the premises that appear, today individualism structures the entire society, whether educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are good at individualism of "mass"!!
Without making an inexhaustible horizon, is there not any relationship with the cartesian approach to examining what we get to believe, what we believe ourselves.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fecund.
Making Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
By placing the problem at the level of his paranoid nombrel, he blocked any progress and reflection on the reality of madness.
And brought the most reducing and reactive vision that follows: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this point and to be anti-conformist, it is to fight against this decoupling.
We're blaming Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of the order.
That's a great idea.
Be nice and rebellious, ask some...
Black and red, to the others.
Beaups and robots, they include the most followers of those who see themselves in their mirror.
In any case, thank you for your controversial debates about putting Marcel Gauchett under the light of the news, this humanist patient and persistent, and so pedagogically enlightening.
David Cameron supports the increase in inheritance tax threshold
How many other budgetary cuts will be necessary to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it is no longer in power.
Business councils, talks, consultation fees, a series of best sellers written by a nigger on the "serious policy" – it will cost £100 once the weapon has passed to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want taxes on inheritance.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will pay the very least inheritance tax due to super-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where inheritance kills innovation.
it will cost £100 once it has passed the weapon to the left.
Anything.
He will probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say is worth.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown thought only of his own heirs, or were you just a brainless tribalist?
We didn't choose him last time, we had a coalition in place.
You couldn't afford to accuse him of lying unless he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normal".
Climate change and collapse will bring it to an end, he and the rest of his life.
His “richness ” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeds £ 1,000,000,000,000.
We all have to be taxed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that the teaching of discipline is unnecessary, of course, I just say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "inadequacies".
Unreasonable statement for the professor of math that she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training for teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other approach than quantitative ones.
There are 2 possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge => reform recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => it is reduced to establish a challenging relationship that causes the whole world to suffer a total loss => it would take 1 training to teach.
A professional who learns, of course.
But teaching is primarily an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not about making car parts.
This is not the case even when we are pro of math!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is missing right now is a true vocation among bcp of those who embrace the professor
If the gifts exist, teaching (I prefer teaching of discipline) allows those who are less comfortable not to make mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students whose 1/3 tell us: learning doesn't serve at all I already know what I think.
A Slate article well describes the chaotic situation of this return.
We regret the old Normal Schools of Institutes..
It ends at 3:00 in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If this is the case, it is appropriate to use it in any way.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
That's not right with me!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing that's called iplayer and that allows us to listen to the demand when we want it!
The Internet, it's amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio broadcasts anymore.
I have a type USB adapter behind my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I was wrong in my schedules, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 o'clock.
Even though it's men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her antenna when one of them is on vacation or sick, at least that would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its release is from any sensational debate, and it would be much better on a chain such as LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of Chris Evans' regular animators in the morning at Simon May's show on the night of the return to work, is not a woman
It's five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shenann knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-retardant of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the glacial air from a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's quiet, waiting for the current team to get hurt or turn around.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alter power and make the keys of the country to each other in less good condition than they did.
The campaigns are very poor, much poorer than the banlieus with increasingly isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't deal, they don't interest political men...
But thank you for not talking about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doctoral, it's among men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have very high rates of absenteeism and early alcoholism as well...
The UN thrives on human besties, culture and ignorance so much as to say that it still has an enormous potential for growth, they really have to be bad because they didn't do better...
Today, the UN thrives primarily on poverty, the fear of the daily, the fear of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a pitiful human being.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.

That's what happens.
Who are they?
"forgettables" in fact there is less than a resource =>low of resources.
Here's the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I am saying here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being questioned, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This makes it clear that women can work in the economic sphere and that it is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing that women will then have a double blow, i.e. they will be expected to go to work while continuing to play their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
The economy and profit do not recognize the roles of sex.
Money is talking, and if a sex isn't high, next!
The benefits make fun of the life you eat.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what you have to offer?
The benefits are ridiculed for the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women aged 20 to 45.
Well said, my sister.
It is very difficult for anyone to talk about unremunerated social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is carried out by women) must be more than 50% of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention that men are not doing enough), but it enables us to operate our companies and preserve our work.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to get back to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when carrying out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it will do a lot to help people who have to "cook a house".
The tiger is not Russian, it's only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are the only ones responsible for the current situation and would be better able to sit at the negotiating table.
The right-to-self-determination tiger and the Russian soldiers are just in practice near the border, long-term exercises ahead of the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Release the Tigris!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He immediately came to me with the same idea.
Here is a pretext all found to arm a few separatists to annex China.
If Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, a magnificent feline and in real danger of extinction eventually turn it into a well-directed article against Putin?
What's he doing inside?
This is, therefore, not a leaf on Siberian tiger, but a leaf on the consequences of a com operation of Putin.
When we expose ourselves to the media, we also expose ourselves to irony or criticism.
The perpetual victimization of the soviet-poutian sympathizer.
Hollande had also taken the pear with his camel without shouting at the anti-French plot.
There our learning Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the patron saint of the Great Russia, has been personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger understands everything, he shuts down...
What the Netherlands is doing, it's one thing.
At first glance, this seemed to be a horrendous idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it would be said that it is both a response to a real problem - emergency dental subsidies - and effective ones.
It is therefore difficult to find something to read.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% after, it was a little empty sense to complain about paternism.
After all, there's no harm in brushing your teeth!
In fact, in the end, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that is true, then it is not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants provided by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Ministry of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seemed reasonably well thought.
There's a problem with brushing your teeth.
If you kiss them after drinking wine, it may damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can bite the knee and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guinean book of memories where someone had tried to brush their teeth the longest time and the Guinean judges at the time had strongly advised it to do so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged brushing.
At first glance, it's very funny.
It seems to me to be an experimental design.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study would have changed the habits of participants who knew that brushing teeth would be studied.
This is why most behavioral studies include such things as double blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person with social benefits, there are two things that differ from this test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not provide feedback on when they brush or brush their teeth (lightly mistaken results by people who deliver their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterine) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be passed on to the next generation.
Does the urinary tract affect this phenomenon?
The nesting itself looks like a kind of graffiti.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not want to have a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a problem?
It seems to me to go beyond the limit of reasonable.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not lead to ever further, without questioning the issue of ethics, taking risks, for the mother and for her baby.
No, the medicine is not all powerful, it is not unlimited, and yes it is unhappy and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they wish to have.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the
But let people, women, others, have their bodies, their sense of love that can go to risk taking and manage your little testicles to you alone, only in your little pants to you alone.
from their "conference" this magical bag for them to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him in my safe if he could still give love.
The current stressful circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about his communication, but if "we" agreed to think, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What you're going to put nn as an argument against: cf here all these men's reactions curiously....
Marjane, every organ donation has nothing to do with anodin.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodinous.
I was registered as a donor of spinach flour (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and this is understood both for the recipient and for the donor), it is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not be able to judge in any way or take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing to do with anodin, and it strengthens the act of love that it implies.
Giving a kidney to a member of his family who needs it doesn't have any more anodin, and that's what happens!
Please don't mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially that there's no real competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Sportivo has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for Monday, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid goals records this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put an end to his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you a big deal if it's not that Valencia has defended well and without counting the property, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the ground environment wouldn't get out too fast, but they played well.
The game of Parejo all gets better.
An affrequent penalty fired claimed but saved in just the right way by Diego.
A Chautious Ambience Mestalla and it didn't have to be funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, was published in the magazine Archeologia 524 of September last.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what is becoming intuitive.
It's not surprising that before making it complicated, it's simple.
All science progresses little by little.
And was the "The Organ" of the woman who was so preserved for him?
Passionant!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read some time ago that a black-child mom had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, including geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mom was 1,000 years earlier than the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you in advance.
She's got some reading she's got.
These may not be contaminants of modern times.
Wasn't the desert at the time stretched less far than it is now?
Why not imagine plants like cannabis pushing to the place where there is only sand now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough for a knowledgeable European to say it, even without any evidence, to be a scientific truth: the Egyptians and so today's Africans have never invented anything of themselves.
But the song does not tell us what are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it's not always "of his poorly known ancestors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market kicks, which preaches against the mobility of people and for the mobility of property.
I think there are other people who are attacked by Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying about, not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they might remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but the rule of law governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Although I think that the government here is only a band of assholes, good at nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt it's their biggest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and his colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people in this country to keep their heads off the water, I would say that yes, it is important.
If they were absolutely to repatriate the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't have sent them to an air base and cared for them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its power base, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing lawyer in charge of public relations such as Cameron, and as Cameron, I think it's wrong in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it's not easy here) socially it's far to his right and would well find its place to the religious fairs of right in America.
Now he must sing the praise of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I apologize, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party right to Spanish law.
These are separate cases, believe me.
The Spanish Government is talking about almost everything about it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get out of it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions to the forum.
Many TPE patterns - SMEs seem to read The World to take the time to condemn the words of P.
Let's talk about the anti-intellectualism of the environment.
A professor of law at the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless it is the Nobel Prize of the economy and proposes to fully liberalise it
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villerme found the work of children aged 8 and 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were seeking a collective agreement signed.
Ah the good old time...
Your reaction is equally fascinating because of your ignorance of the TPE master's job!
His profession is not to know the right in all his ways, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts written on my youth salary bulletin, over 100 information today!
Here is an example, one could cite much more, which illustrates the constant flow of pressures, imposed without measure on the consequences, and which exacerbate the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
To wreak havoc on the archi-ressed argument of the French Labour Code's thickness compared to the helvette, a serious university student would have dived into the Swiss texts and compared the number of official texts, then the number of comments (the absence of the latter which may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
Comments in a Code, whether it's work or not, refer to case law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example....
Who's that complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, case law, conventions, contracts) are unbearable obstacles to work and trade?
What's he doing?
How hard is that?
Pullmann "Art has practically become immunized against the criticism of Mrs.
Is this guy still in the mood?
It's probably time for new revolutionary absurdities to make criticism...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I have read recently, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Go to something else!
Let's see where the choice is in the art world.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokespersons of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GenisCan is probably a troll from the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokespersons of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokespersons are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my little lunch.
I apologize, but at all costs it was necessary to expose it (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who breaks up the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, isn't it?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to draw attention.
True artists make the difference.
A great artist.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy of holding an election mandate for extremists on any side (including Zionists) must be dismissed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the plot, which were worth a number of judicial convictions, shame Israel and the mayor of Neuilly.
He doesn't represent either.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting the truth alone, marginally.
HOW TO REMEMBER
What is the mind of the Mariie de Neuilly against Philipe Karsenty, who was harassing a journalist and his family, and who publicly called on to attack this urbanist?
Crime apology?
I can't find Neilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges????
This type needs care, as did Ulcan Chelli, both in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy and whose sources are perfectly identical to those of their most angry detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sionists" (the term of which tends to disappear because of its abuse), these two, as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe to see in any criticism, even banal, an object anti-Semitism "that is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still fertile the belly of the beast my good lady would have come back to Russia in the 19th century!"
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are a very fragile beast.
And this type has political responsibilities, it is extremely worrying.
In order to clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of 11 September, we are talking about cognitive discrimination on how to address the issue.
Totally blinded by a completely grim truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable for this theory to detach itself (as in the case of extreme religious).
If a logical and ineligible escape ahead, the end justifies all means, even lies, which is a fold, but a fold does not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you do for September 11.
There is still a lot of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/Assortments do not seem to be ready to respond.
There are actually very far-reaching theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing else is funny now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
Just as smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive consumption of alcohol is rising", but what demands (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider this an attack - will you drink a glass and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by holding back.
The Government ends up enjoying it when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two medium-sized bottles per day are at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should agree (about one or two glasses, but especially not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to take them deep, like the smokers!
They're already doing it. Soon it'll be herb!
My father didn't drink or smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years.
So I will continue to drink my two red bottles on Fridays and Saturdays at night (and the other night when my wife is not there).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used?It is an old time that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not linked to the risk of cancer today????
sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not a good company.
The sharks can catch the cancer of the skin.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when one can run and vice versa.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
Both of them destroyed our F1 under the pretext of security.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or even worse Wendlinger's accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but attention to point number 1: it is not the F1, but the circuit authorities who have refused to move forward so as not to steal the TV broadcasting cables.
Totally accurate, +1
I would just like a quick and quick recovery in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that have occurred between bulking and f1 were free warnings.
It was known that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, among other things, had been saying it for years.
How the hell did the race organisation and the FIA allow these maneuvers without leaving the safety car?
I cannot accept that we invoke the risks of the profession or the failure of chance when we have not prevented the predictability.
But this accident was it.
However, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which not only means "prohibition to go beyond the area" but was primarily intended to signal a danger.
It's not embarrassing, it's happy for the family that was supposed to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots will just take off their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more trapping the next turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can even be "reduced" at a "reduced" speed compared to a normal rate.
But, well, we're caused in the void here, until we've seen the images, we can't give a notice.
I don't see much of what this changes.
Are there any injured?
According to the CBC, no injuries have been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the dissatisfaction.
It's hard to believe there's still work to be kept safe 24 hours a day.
I don't think there are any injured people because Canada is almost empty.
There may be animals injured like bears, mice, etc.
I hope it's ironic.
Some parts of Vancouver have the highest population density in North America and Toronto's agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains do not derail as by charm and these types of trains often cross urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains run very, very often in one day.
In addition, as roads often follow watercourses in regions where lakes, rivers or oceans exist, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near the water.
Thus, all rail traffic across the centre of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a huge potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report on this last night, really shocking.
Have you obviously not read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
This says, when railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the Canadian National Railways Society should attend the next Conference on Dangerous Products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, has an impact on the fundamental religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there could be no other truth.
The whole problem is here, and the achievements of the theologians only strengthen this fact, or to what good talk about the sex of the angels?
"God said: it's good - it's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
The word of a leader (Muslim country but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?".
In other words: obey the priest priest rabbin imam and pray, it will be better!

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, of which Robespiere in a certain way by trying to found a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults : that of the Euro fort ( rather than the one at the moment ) or that of the free market ( usually supported by the State when it is necessary to rewind ) , etc .
Great ideas from religious resurrections.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is on the move and expresses himself in the schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the State, and the gods served ambitions even though it also carried forms of dispute.
The theory of loyalty to the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time did not know the question.
Fanaticism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts that are filled with explicit appeals to the hatred of the wrongdoer.
Rather, they are the moderate religious (and fortunately they are the most) who "read badly" the texts and hold them back only from humanism and common values throughout humanity, atheists and different believers.
For me, fanaticism is the stupid and evil application of passages from sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Koran calling for the killing of "believers", "infidels", "hypocrits", "Jewishs" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if we do not read some verses above or below that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a position of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit:" about the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous among the "savanti".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to take from this is that it has led to a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage he showed in the clip?
Band of Neanderthals overpaid and hypersexualized.
They've done enough to ruin humanity!
What exactly did they bring us apart from the neighbors, for life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Devil of Tasmania and this satanic Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off the TV for a moment, you will see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that has produced such wonderful singers as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Australia's notables include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blancett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is a New Zealander, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.
Sox doesn't need any help in this section.
How did I manage to think it would be a "small white"!
Another fan of George Lazenby.

The most brilliant.
Her articles are missing out on purpose.

The almost total number of 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritically suggested responsibilities in the article without hesitation until explicitly denouncing separatists is on the world's otanic line that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to entertain the fable of the pro-European neo-Nazi Gentiles who courageously confront the Russian wicked
@SavantCosinus: change browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understood well your saying the wicked are the Ukrainians and the Russian Stalinists you would not be a bit Communist by chance
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "this ticket is not intended to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said he was responsible for Ukraine.
From propaganda?
In Alexandre Kastals: Where do you keep these details about the cashew?
From the Ukrainian army (it unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to it)?
Uncontrolled elements (allowable to say anything)?
Come on, let's go!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Hungary!
And I say this as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvanie, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That says, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the existing powers who has not stopped demeaning Romanian football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperava", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would whitewash the money to its own satisfaction, mainly by selling players who were highly underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was misinformed by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have cost him a fine-free sentence), and was therefore taken 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial was also worth the prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, the Steaua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also provides him with a punishment for trying to sweat (and then dissimulate the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championship, to win the title and win the jackpot of the League of Champions.
The team he tried to sweat was our neighbors from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be Cluj's first champions, while they were relegated.
I always smell so much at this moment.
The dissimulation of this attempt to corruption involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that implied that the money the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this uneducated poor guy, idiot, cheater and liar doesn't represent me, and he'll never do it.
The Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist assholes today.
You might think that after the last time they broke down stage drawers and store windows, and where they had branded racist banners in the streets, they couldn't have had tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was ready to take the queens back to Al-Ittihad.

Great article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done this, we would have heard the left yelling like a great sick man.
But since it's nice Holland, a friend of the trade unions and small people, we hear a little protest, but it's all down.
For this reason, economic environments sometimes prefer that a party claiming to be left-wing settles in power.
It's the bankers who financed Obama's victory, and they weren't the ones to invest!
"the absurd idea that most job seekers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should the employment pole generalize unemployment control early 2015?
I hope that in the crowd, fiscal pole, it will also generalize the absolute control of those who are commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasion, stealing patterns, and other malandrins.
Do you know how to make a sentence without banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
It's true when we have a class: we treat the population with no teeth and no teeth.
At every new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who are most often not even accused of receiving it, it was automated.
It is also the total lack of follow-up or support on the part of the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I will add that the patronage "socialist" of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Have we read here an article from the chained candard?
It is learned that a unemployed person may be left without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to look for employment by his own means.
It is learned that controls have enabled people who for more than half did not receive unemployment benefits.
So we wonder how we can control people that we never see.
The question arises as to what kind of penalty is radiation for someone who has no access to employment or unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, we ask what it will help recruits.
"We learn that a unemployed person can remain without news for several months from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" It is indeed shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
It is not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done much about racism in the foot no more?
Should we chase them out of the EU?
The EU was only economical and should remain.
The aim is not to be a "police of thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't make any sense on an economic level.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is Europe's most unequal society.
What equality??
Eastern European teams continue to have corrupt mafia's arbitrators who are UEFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this corrupt profit organization and creates its own.
At least we'll look at football.
This cross-racism is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
The ideals of equality in Europe?
So what was Europe doing to let the United Kingdom enter?
The Uefa should applaud them for having played the comedy of Blaster and his men.
It's been happening all over the world for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to see himself retorting small symmetrical phrases, just history of maintaining controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there was, there will be, and there will be people who use to pour oil on the fire.
The decoding would be that Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would mean that to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, it would be necessary to take action against the Israeli state of armed identity occupying the siege of the colonial oppressive destroyer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population that was not for anything in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to empty the Bavarian people of their Germans (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the surviving Jews.
That would have been justice, Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic people.
Sir, let's take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
Let Morocco be the colonialist. It's an obvious!
But as for Israel, we must also question history, its allies and its support for questioning truths.
No matter what colonialism is, it has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirates to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule was colonized by the Romans, but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gauls or others.
In Palestine, discrimination is well on the basis of origin.
Furthermore, the Israeli state is defined as a "Jewish people" whose non-Jewish people will not be included.
The Israeli state discriminates against the non-Jewish people, from which he is pleased.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break up with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples were even baptized on behalf of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities we need to stop ignoring.
Primo, the European Zionist project (colinising Palestine) involved the possession of Palestinians, which was therefore an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needed to break down with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been missing bites from the start.
Their young result will give them what bites their fingers.
It should begin its rehabilitation by small holes.
I hope he didn't lose his appetite for the game.
We tolerate so many subtleties, including racial injuries and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him back in England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the keyboards exist and, therefore, players will get hurt.
The fact that getting his teeth into the flesh of an opponent to have the advantage certainly doesn't have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for performing a similar gesture.
This is the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would be the consequences for you?
I knew someone was going to bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this sarcasm to two balls.
I bet he was eager to come back and play with his teeth.
All these words games about Suarez are losing their bite.
I had a bite at the hamlet.
A prerequisite for a good school course is respect by students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents instill that respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they feel that they are also respected by their teachers and their children's school.
In good institutions, those who make their students progress, parents are considered partners, not em..
Who can believe that it is the professor who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the roof.
But it's probably easier to go to school.
Parenting is not operational.
No one's really taken care of them.
The action will then remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could do a lot of things.
Operational solutions are located there.
Should actors (professors, hierarchies and the Ministry) play their role and not constantly lose touch.
We can disband a group that gets rid of it, not families.
How can you not talk about teaching?
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
It seems that teachers are being trained, but we forget the first role of the school.
Submitting knowledge.
And if there is a requirement for parents, it is the school that provides instruction for their children.
What is the minister who will dare to re-establish what was called the Public Instruction.
Defective article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment from this beaut of the Eastern banlieus?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think it's Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
Not surprisingly, we have a budgetary emergency.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
exactly true
That's it.
A little from Aloysius.
His electorate is Sydney North headquarters.
Indeed a beaut of the North coast !!!
Well, if British BBC TV viewers wanted to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would of course come to the conclusion that both were led by the party of Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It passes for a grinch, today. :(
Yes, but the good leader regularly leaves him hungry.
Rather, you will also be embarrassed if you wake up one morning and realize that you will never have the Prime Minister's role and that all these legitimate and illegal benefits will never remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried to submit a budget in half and then abandoned.
At least he doesn't threaten to beat someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be able to command it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and to demand State aid.
And as she knows how to lobbying, there's no fear of the result.
And so much for the job in France that she has nothing to do, she always comes out of vegetables ready to break when their company has losses on the markets, in particular...
It's just because their lobbying didn't work unless the order was cancelled.
If the company had got the time or planning for marble, there was no doubt that the project would have come.
Then, to know whether it is right or wrong and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice for "the world" to think about!
Brittany Ferries is held by British legumes.
Those who burn the tax and dry centers.
They want state aid.
That they didn't seem to be normal for the least.
And to the extent that an army ship under the French metropolitan flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, it is normal to expect a coup d'état.
Or then we are condemned to tolerate British monopolies.
It's the choice.
Eternal French problem which considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-lived.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton Pavilion with exclusively teams made up of pure Bretons.
With that, they're sure to make the costs go down significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that is what the BBC now expects.
They have always hated everything related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to Genesis than to other members of the group in the 1970s.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work anymore.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "detesting everything related to the prog," as they have just broadcast an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he had various degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has the right to collect a bunch of semi-final demos and call this a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, the first solo album of Bank, is absolutely great, and all in the mind of Genesis of the 1970s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been realized if they had not had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I have still not seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have as interesting a story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good notes.
I would say, however, that the BBC "always" hates the fact that it loves progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest screams "prejudiced": of course.
A little more of the interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
It's a beautiful song.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocent people), then it is an exciting success.
There will always be a difference in size between a death penalty criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his false understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the vision and reflection of the most just and wise of a society.
I mean, they don't have any excuses.
They're defenseless.
Yes, we understood your point of view for the first time.
That's exactly where the difference lies, Mr. LeClos.
There must be a very different spirit in the community of the mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has been doing since his false understanding of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge among the relatives of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never prevail to those who wisely decide the death of others since the sound and just reasoning of their paedastal.
However, in order to try to balance the analysis, it could also be argued that the death sentence often committed a savage violence, which he was able to enjoy, against people who were very friendly, who had done so free of charge.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually be relieved of their pain by the disappearance of the one who has been drunk, sometimes the tormentor, of being loved and who spends their nights.
Let us not neglect their relief.
Thank you, Emilio, for this thought I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he is very intelligent.
The heart's cell.
That's no doubt what I've been reading for a long time.
It would be believed, however, to read stories from another time, from ancient things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then that's the dates that are cleaving, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so great.
Same for the other two "Excellent American Romanciers" quoted here.
Roth, Pinchon and De Lillo are all surfaces.
I thought you stopped white, man.
What's left of it?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than this miserable Bellow, who got him the prize.
Perhaps the Nobel judges of this year decided that if we had to have an American winner, we could still have a [light] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They all produce "genie novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph against...
Which one did you read?
How many DeLillo books do they have?
I never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading her other books.
Did you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III" ?
White Noise?
The first lightest novels, the craziest, the smallest, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'm gonna end up in Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite romance is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's of simple interest.
It was a treaty of humor, "the law", not a definition application.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so obvious here that the lady acted in SON only interest, and absolutely not in the institution she represented, that what the term "conflict" comes to be called into question.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very expensive!
Yes, State services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they did not prevent it from being dangerous.
After we hear that French employees are not dynamic and seek only peace.
The inundated areas that become viable the next day when a large construction program is going to be launched are classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "of our days, there are no floods due to the barriers of regulation".
Now, we need to expand the lakes of retention up and cross the fingers.
But it'll be because of state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
Couple of ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is that where the interest is?
Exit the computer and you will dream of your life as you could have been in place of Ms. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute on the Sea and former President of the Urban Commission, who allows you to build!
The 2 mothers of Triomphant Sarkozysm are the old and the real estate.
I am left and not completely sympathetic to Sarko, but svp, not low political or low Azimuth hits, we are not in there in a battle of pounding balls.
I wonder if the girls involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are tough criminals.
The U.S. is a fucking hole.
So what kind of fucking hole do you live in?
The U.S. is not a fucking hole.
Yes, U.S. figurines are hardened because of the raisins they have dealt with in the daily.
Of course, none of them ever do anything, but the girls "come to bother them because they're racist."
There's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the United States, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is lacking to force people to see the problem as close as possible.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You're ignoring her here.
The good guys have to denounce the corrupt racist girls.
VENDEZ-LESS!
Let's figure it out.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is it the first time you've been involved in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant, but it's clearly you who don't care - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetuum problem that racism is in the United States (it's not about objective speculation).
It is very likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent to which the tension arises in this regard at this time.
As a result, the boundary between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more insignificant.
Wall Street funds NYPD in various ways, from where the treatment was administered by Occupy there.
What I'm surprised about is the naivety of some and I'm shocked by the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think the investigators find their information?
On the Internet?
They will question the responsible, make them talk, raise confidence.
That Lhomme is going to Elisea has nothing really surprising.
Then, what counts is cutting, checking, analysis.
And here it is understood that sarcomas are concerned.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-arcosyism based on business-supplied pieces (a place and no condemnation) that seem to have been produced by magistrates (2 sent in corrigendum), two Dutch-friendly journalists.
If this confusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be a power organ does not shock you, it is your partial spirit that blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is only coincidence and not remote!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy supports are angry!
From the extract I was able to read, the VA article only drags the tractor.
I even laughed so gross.
For the rest, the World's complaint has little chance of coming because journalists are not "stretched" in the secret of sources, is it?
In contrast, there seems to be no consensus between VA and power, while there seems to be a consensus between the world's power and journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the substance and its dangerous relations.
We are facing a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
From here this editorial to the aboss, which says long about the complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the bird would go well with the smoked hareng!
It is simply for the figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration show was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all co-operating, even refusing to give soup jokes simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship although she claimed that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't PAS at ease"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go right - whoever imposes limits and answers it must be admired even if it is a pub director:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more to the left, it would be Communist.
What do you think New Labour has done, especially to the left?
The liberalisation of a country, the NHS this NHS this repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to provide well the right hand), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-permit, the correct policy that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a left-wing and not a Communist center, I said this to blame, which I mean, they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I have asked you are specific examples of Gaussian politics, or a left-wing program advocated by the New Labour Government.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, that's not what you asked for, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought New Labour was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you requested.
Yeah - it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the UK's most powerful advertising director, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants coming to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We've been beaten in 40 45 to fall into another discount, the one with the money.
We'll make beautiful savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
So, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still makes sense in Europe, should it not?
Interestingly, the Commission does not consider the unfair tax competition between countries for companies.
This must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully marketable.
In short, this means that all pans of the French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment that has already been caused by many territories will only strengthen.
All sacrifice, including the advance of a country, on behalf of the liberal doxa did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be dealt with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify SNCF's accounts.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to comply with its commitments.
However, using public money without waste is essential in our day when public resources are being forced.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what the TER competition could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he certainly be the head of the cheerleader?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, always coming to an end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Obviously, having an ex alcoholic who lives so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would seem to me to begin the separation process between your life and the complications you have inherited.
We'd say that's what they're doing, but it makes me feel hostile.
Since you all live so close to each other and that complications seem likely to persist while new ones are on the surface, have you thought of a "run-off plan" so that you can make a cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have an adverse effect, but with a company of compatible real estate credit, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He's got vindictive and persistent.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and offer support to help him to resume his work and pay for the food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more things than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask your children what they would like to do, even if this involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them you'll support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises regarding contact and ask them to consider how this would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not keep his appointments.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you doing this for their own good, despite your own feelings because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continuous relationship between parents and children, they will know who will thank you when they are older.
I am of the opinion that children end up understanding who is wrong, if we let them see things for themselves.
Go another little effort you are close to the Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years, civilization will have disappeared, short-term economic interests are too powerful, it is the soil pot against the iron pot.
In addition, with globalization, the country that does at least say social, fiscal, but also environmental, has therefore a competitive advantage, and the others are obliged to follow.
What politicians are looking for is growth, growth.
It would take international coordination, but from here...
These are not the climate receptors that produce from the C02.
It is everyone who warms himself, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in homes that he had to build, those who buy industrial products that he had to produce and transport.
It's not the weather-sceptics that showed up against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate change and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climate receptors emit more than CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not be sufficient.
There is also a need for political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensibilities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise by McArtur on March 11, 1942 when he left the Philippines.

I'm sorry about the screwup that took all the money.

The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our retirements, to take care of our old ones, to empty their hygienic pools, bury 30,000 people who die every year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and your bonnet, which allow you to warm up, warm up and eat this cheese sandwich).
Don't be like that.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a (bad) joke or is it not explicit?

This is how the public money is spent to allow a small minority of individuals to spend some time in space to make skims and go around while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
So the reality television has nothing invented and the authorities are probably waiting for a baby to be designed up there to burn the world and strip the media coverage of Western kings used to the motherhood of tabloids.
They may have to go down to the ground to find that we're fighting here!
Unlike what you seem to think, we don't send men or women into space to make chicken or clowns, but to work.
And these works are very useful for mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily life are from space research.
So, yeah, it's money that's spent useful.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a freak.
the billiard style that works at the point in the air (to write to the ceiling, for example)
To pay for his deals?
To participate in the manufacture of a single useless product?
Or propose how to make more money for investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and represents the vacuum itself.
Ah so the last high tech game.
Behind the infinite minority of individuals who go into space, there are dozens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who fight what, including more and more private companies, especially to lift the charge to the station.
If you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't intend to buy plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy them in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to shock people to make them believe it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article would have hurt the author/editor rather than put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "swords in plastic"?
Or even be curious enough to ask what was meant by the inscription (if any) above?
Bad typical report, we wait for the fact that "it's only a plastic sword" and not the inspiring jjuadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the main symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to overthrow the Governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped laughing at the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In skilled hands, they can be mortal.
Even the little blankets we give in the quick rest can penetrate the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, this justifies the ridicule the author gives it.
It's not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a sword in plastic," the facts you've told them actually support his argument.
I saw these decorative objects on the occasion in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they had never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Soft Jesus, you're right.
And that makes all its sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and who distributed plastic knives to anyone all night!
I like the conclusion very much.
All the wonderful innovations, often technologically, make many people think that it is a right and a need to benefit from them, but they have an immediate and worse cost, an estimated cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that they spend on budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies that generate frustration.
For example, call on the Energy Pact Solidarity, which allows you to isolate the cables of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (the cost of work is actually borne by energy suppliers!).
Simple effective but unknown even though more than 3000 houses were thus isolated this year!
It's interesting about this PES.
But I never heard of it.
Who can call and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, water-saving shower test and recommends placing water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) by 50 m3 of water savings per year, while keeping the same comfort.
It is not a crisis of demand, it is a crisis of the system that can no longer produce enough surpluses (which would then have been redistribution in real terms in the form of income increases) so that these surpluses pay the increase in the expenditures you classify in the category "compulsory expenditures".
In other words, energy precarrying is "just" the opposite of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the (new-)classic) theory of the economy is totally incapable of answering such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can force, increasingly decades after, the pace of economic growth.
From its very definition (in physics), energy is what enables any physical transformation.
Since production is fundamentally transforming, energy is the means to achieve the least economic production (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any pressure on energy gain (inaccurately called "production" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, forces it to increase production (unless it improves energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precarrying and whether or not we can increase the "production" of cheap energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only worsen in the years and decades to come (the AIE, in recent reports, clearly indicates that the peak production of conventional oil was reached in 2008 and that oil was not cheap.
However, oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very high energy density, its transport and handling and storage ease, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work regardless of performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and nothing was brought back, so it makes things even.
Take this from France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a webmaster of the Guardian?
As noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Nice work for the guys.
Although many English like to mock the Scottish when they do nothing but lose, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they are eliminated in the first round.
It's even more rigolo if we play against them;)
England's starting to bother me.
Because now that the "golden Shige generation" withdraws, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
; Ferdinand, D.
Betty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the early XIs, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been an "international class", is David Beckham, a bit of an effeminate, perhaps, but I think if he had a potato overweight like me, he would totally crush me.
People forget their athletic constitution, and they're talking about athletic constitution in sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never mock the Scottish.
I tend to be surprised to observe their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been an "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best, a very good player.
It is true that Jumpe would have had trouble asking for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he'd get them if he asked them...
Are you saying that people come here to do a good job?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his Members' Compensation...
I ask myself, above all, to know what he can tell in his conferences.
How can you reduce your deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer of scientific discipline, whatever his scientific level, even if he is the holder of a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for the lowest amount.
Conferences with content are mostly free or almost free of charge.
And I can assure you that these young people are working really and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is constructive.
The researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It all lights up for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I feel like we're blaming him for making money?????
I am far from being one of his fans, but he is accused of being ill (or fraudulently) managing his OK campaign.
But making conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remind you that her moves are supported by taxpayers.
Rule No.1 of epidemiology: isolate.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human life is more important than right politics.
It is present in Spain, in GB, in Texas and in other potential locations.
To what extent will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola invades West Africa, I see them banning all flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We'd still need to send some goods.
What a shame that the panic of international media about Ebola is no longer used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's such a sad journalistic article, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (also relevant): Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and the differences in the role of the sexes that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think about it and write, we're not happy to make a noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same level as decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbaric, its survival rate making only a different form of torture - say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" beyond understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give some degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case of course it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was "dumming" as a world resource of journalism - moving forward in the 21st century, leaving its founding precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, does this look like?
There is no money for a territorial election or any other election.
I read constantly that the territorial public service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate, indeed.
There will certainly be lies and truths, to separate us from the good seed of the Hebrews.
The court of accounts costs so much to tell so many economic nuisances.
It is true that they never had anything to do with the people on Cambon Street.
The ICTs are not in deficit; they have funding needs that can only relate to and only to the investments they make.
It has the power to use too vague concepts of the press as the World makes the game of all obscurantisms.
Debt is beneficial because it is a fund of investment, of collective heritage
Unfortunately, the financial debt is mainly operating costs...
And as staff redundancy (to make beautiful rounds-points, for example) entails a growing and uncompressable burden (compulsory burden up to their death, as living work + retirement), these communities cut down on investments.
It is therefore necessary to delete the status of a civil servant, prior to the decrease in the number of staff.
And also responsible the mayors financially.
It is fabulous that the intercoms would have to be accompanied by a decrease in the number of Community staff, and that is the opposite, proof that adding one scale is not effective without the removal of others.
How do you want to properly manage large territories like peanuts at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse in which these territories were created is revolutionized, perhaps it would be time to react.
They would not prefer to remain in prison, worse incarcerated, in the administrative picture, would he stop!
Let's try even garrotes, it's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the condition of the Veme has led with its providential men.
It really started with Petin.
Then he went on to finish the series "end of breath" coming very far.
Why won't they live in an apartment of $250 million in Monaco over a movie to leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind "is the fault of the whites".
"Answers" does not "response"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
That was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to make.
It is now agreed that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years) are part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had said a few months ago that no military hospital would stop.
So he's lying.
No doubt it was the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now, we know we can't trust him anymore.
Let's go!
in 2017:Transformation in a comfortable special hotel with golden posters for future retirements of the Republic?
Moving from the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the Nantis and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money, and the soldiers are going to take care of the flu of the last one...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all horizons?
London Wasps?
I'm sorry about their fans based in Wycombe/London.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They left the "London" last season.
It's just the "Wasps" now.
A Franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, aren't they?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, moves outside for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we had the misfortune of being bought by the Sharks Sales, and we ended up renting our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other places, did not do us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that has no problem with supporters and that has recently been at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage repeated by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent issues of the CCFC, but that must be a good trick.
For my part, I'm not the rugby club, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except for some Wasps fans at work.
They and some thousands of other people in the South East are probably going to follow them far away or are they going to have to support another team now?
Nice pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But then why aren't all computer systems based on these concepts?????
+because there is a huge amount of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because all systems don't need them, +because there is no magic baguette +...
And because for most computer systems, bugs are not really important, what counts is being the first on the segment.

But they don't sell.
Real-time information technology has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't gone to an Olive Garden in 15 years.
The quality price ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices whose popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It would be said that they are reasoning with Fairy more profit, and not healthier dishes and the best price ratio.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, make sure people don't have too much grass.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's salt in there, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you need to add to the water of pasta is negligible, but this greatly boosts the taste of the finished product.
It's not just salt taste, it also affects the way pasta is cooked.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Are there family restaurants and are they offering tasty meals at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
A banal job accident that went wrong.
A young promiseor, a learned thief, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man has all torn and brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
If he is sentenced to 10 years in prison, he seems to be the least.
Where else are you going?
All right!
What a humour!
The desire to find it is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to find out is difficult to excuse.
That's what makes me have some sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he would never see his son again, but did not ask forgiveness for the kind of people he killed himself.
Who's really the victim in this story?
What is it that you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was sentenced for what he did.
With regard to the concierge of lost balls, the accused and guilty, he knew that the balls were dangerous.
The guy didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for.
10 years, it's a little too much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make noise?
Actually, that's a noise!
If the opportunity arises, go on vacation in the Mosul valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
I do it twice, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
Excuse me, Moselle Valley, I've been writing too fast.
It is a pleasure to see that German wine is recognized.
Rather important, German vineyards traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means they really have to push hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is only one region of the Moselle that needs to be recommended - France, the Palatinate Rhenan (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or perhaps the reverse, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now offer a lot of them, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines bottled at the property are so complex, the mildness is beautifully balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatle with a thermostat homer next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a great guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a summary of each newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on the German wines that are coming, the new thirsts of Baden that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly powerful, but above all, it is not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people were drinking when they were young (well, I really don't think it's always true or evocative, unless I address myself to more than 40 years - who, as I say, will already have seen this).
Closing the Val de Grace would be an enormous mistake and an illustration of the sad state in which the Administration of France is located.
A crime against Louis XIV and an epinephrine in the feet of my grandfather and uncle who did their studies.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the House of Deputies: these cabinets of ministries that are held by the barbarian, and these closed-house decisions have become unbearable.
Sorbogreen's right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: Euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Furthermore, meat that will feed our poor (sic) assets could be resold because they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you will no longer have problems with deficit!
For older people, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets will not be able to hold only this demographic transition...
So from the hierarchy, sure, but to think differently than a hospital model of the 30 gloryes.
Now, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this has already been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of medical excellence in France: a certain rigour and discipline that we knew more about in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First of all, we're wrong because the rest of the hospitals aren't high.
The scandal is that presidents and other elites are cared for elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more likely to increase public service in hospitals than to maintain a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign of more of the march towards the mediocrit of France.
Not to mention military status, which must be preserved entirely.
"The daily hospitalization price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The oppression of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than the one he had at home.
In almost all countries of the world, a child born in that country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by giving birth to children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not respond to some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why?
It seems to me to take two weights two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecution and ill-treatment and war that make people from their countries flee and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by ship, then we need to solve the problem that causes this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country returned to normal.
It all makes sense now, nimble...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and abuses that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended Tamil deportations linked to LTTEs, thinking that they would be at risk of torture upon their return.
UNHCR revised its guidelines on assessment of asylum applications in December 2012, and recommended that persons with links to LTTEs be considered at risk of their return.
The year [2013] saw a rise in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial councils took place in September.
Allo late, boys!
Mr. Novak, you've had your coconut all the time.
In fact, this guy couldn't get a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So I would have given you any treatment.
I would like to know who was going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhas, without some lab pay for the search of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help come later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!
There was little more, we were told that the Ebola killed so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there was all scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of infection of the returned persons was zero.
I'm afraid I'm afraid.
You have to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low or low three but not zero.
Finally, c is a scientific reality, the more a virus is fatal quickly (generally) less likely to spread because the death of the host signifies its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes occurs from the Spanish influenza.
After c is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
There is nothing obscenous about putting forward media from certain brave and virtuous Westerns, but to the detriment of thousands of other African patients, who were not known to the profession, the bravery, or the virtues?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help them, but repeating the announcements is a horrendous partisan.
Freedom of expression, so much loved by the Conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of weapons attacking freedom of expression and the right to private life of Australians.
I bet they had never imagined that their conservatives would have deprived them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need at the moment, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A warm-up tour for when the problem really gets out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Medical Research Markets Fund, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely only an emergency black box for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters can see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we don't want to believe him.
He explained that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Terminary Markets Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the poor.
It may be very clever, but it's not fair.
Finally, Telstra's "false banker" and its Endangered Market Fund were excellent tutors.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell to the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is even the "old personality", delicious....
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as it is.
If only she could deter her from keeping a buzz on her constantly.
The worst destination for a career end policy: not to be recognized in the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her town of Toul as being high enough to administer it.
What a good "provincial" sense!
We're living a bad time, Mrs. Morano.
I'm sure I'm against the port of burqa, but that's not the point.
What this anecdotes relates is sarcosm to the pure state: of mediocre minorities with ministerial rank, confusion between the government function and the executive function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on every accent of the road to show that he is well-guardian of the public order), the grossity and inconsistencies of their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "old personalities" who have become disappointed in carrying a firearm and a sign should be allowed to enjoy their self-proclaimed role as judges.
But who is Nadine Romano?
It is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not regret it.
He really has to stop before it gets embarrassing for him.
I'm sending this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like Bob, for the blow
You don't agree, thanks to her we're doing well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, we should have invented it!
It's easy, though, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
About this time, N.
Morano obviously did in the contempt indeed, in the contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who would certainly have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes, of course, Madam, immediately, Madam, tell me in which direction I have to run to catch myself without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets left an air attack on a target of Isis when the risk of killing civilians became too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I think Isis is going to go beyond them or have already done so, in Iraq at least someone was counting the dead bodies right now.
In the case of industrial-scale civilian deaths, nothing competes with the Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two Iraq wars would have cost the lives of millions of Iraqis, especially children, elderly people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew would prefer sanctions against the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of guy who preferred sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsiderately in recent years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - no doubt a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not spend time marking their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission's QG that they had raised just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bombing, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission had been targeted like this.
Well, I actually forgot about that.
Therefore, add one and a half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
This only helps your argument to exacerbate unreliable statistics.
The only even vaguely reliable figures on the deaths of sanctions are those of children under 5 years of age and are even very suspicious because Saddam Hussain has refused to allow objective inspectors to detect the facts.
Obviously, it was in his interest to exacerbate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths in at least five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths is widely partial to this age group.
Of course, you have to be afraid of it, but also the gift of games in general.
It is necessary to stop doing as if people were pure minds, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither parent nor child would ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using fantasy arguments, we should explain what serious problems might arise for an adopted child or designed with a gift of gaming.
If you learn that the parents who raised you didn't provide the games you came out of, you could give them back, in my opinion, because they would have committed no crime.
The latest advances of the WFP (e.g. Utrus strike) are at least as questionable as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire for children justify these acrobatics and it has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
Obviously, we need to be afraid of the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that you can't have children when you want them.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being born with or becoming very disabled, contracting a serious illness, losing all his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop you from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumed, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a caprician where one could use the other according to his good wishes.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
