That was my plan.
It was my turn to play, and my king was not attacked, so he wasn't put under the spell, but none of my figures could make the right move. So what they call a drowned king or a draw.

White foot on f3, black foot on e6, white foot on g4, black face on h4 - mat! In chess circles it's called a "durish mat".
White: a1, a foot on b6, a king on c8. Black: a7 and b7, a king on a8, an elephant on b8. White puts the opponent in the position of azugwang, a row on a6, followed by only two options: take a row on a6 or move an elephant on any other field of diagonals b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the foot from b6 to b7 and put the mat. In the second case, the white boat takes a black foot on a7 with the same result.
