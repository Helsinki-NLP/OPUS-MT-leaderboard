It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped worrying.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take some time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
He's walking with me.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I call you?
Do you like the point?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
Only once have we met.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them up.
How much is it worth?
Our water was up to the bush.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still there.
It looked wonderful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was closed.
Breakfast is between seven and nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider the naked to be normal.
We sat down and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves took away the flock.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're not right, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Did you shoot with a gun so far?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a card for your pocket.
I don't want to give up on the police.
You're mad at me. I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom's homeless.
I don't live in Boston.
They've sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a guarantee.
And tomorrow we'll meet?
I should have known you were gonna be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom was doing as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found him.
I never thought I'd find him.
The competition for that job is big.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he's trying to make up for it.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
He was influenced by alcohol.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's having a little bit of a crack in his cheeks.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I wouldn't answer that.
I have to help him.
He's criticizing himself.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom broke the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be silly with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we didn't come from monkeys, but we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop calling Tom.
What could go wrong?
When am I gonna get to Boston?
Tom was eating later.
- Are you helping?
Are you two family?
He wants an egg ham.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather take a subway than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my account.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom's gonna be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he do all he could?
Mary wrapped up the movie.
She's got a pretty handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom, I wrote this report.
Are they buying like this?
Doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you get that back to me?
That was personal.
I'd better go.
Excuse me for a second.
Get the hat down.
Acting is very good.
Please don't move.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not get out of a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza that early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He's gone.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary had been married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs out whenever I'm nauseous.
We've met several times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree's green.
The moon's surface is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom was awfully treating me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that was still worth the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what you wrote in the paper.
Tom said it was an emergency.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human.
You don't make a man with a helmet.
She tried herself.
Run!
Is he paying for the delivery?
I want a reindeer.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass breaks easily.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy them for me?
You didn't see that, did you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's too bad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
The paper is worth a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom's drinking a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonia has four glacial ways: declared, conditional, ordered and handed over.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom was smiling.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's all right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember how I met the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What will be Japan's economy next year?
That's just how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you don't sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a bullet.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our court is big.
It's a kid's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom took me to the fucking mother.
I didn't have only one hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I almost got out of my mind.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
There's no gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a big alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw that.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary's flower?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom's been complaining about is food.
Make sure you don't get stuck in a muddy bar.
Both of them coughed.
The train went through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day of doom on which they will try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom knows Mary since the garden.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future starts today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still don't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got his room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"You die better on your feet than living on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I've got him a scarf.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was especially hard to keep talking because of the difficult speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The time forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were trying to drown the submarine in vain.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
He's getting close.
When do you learn?
It was hard for Tom to swallow his pills.
It's worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
Tom's making Mary happy.
Tom's pointless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by human beings.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't look busy.
We'll catch up on that.
Didn't you hear me say?
Oh, for a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Pull out the stringer.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom went ahead to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise.
So you didn't want the reward?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Get in touch.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is stupid.
We've been bankrupting.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me?
I like school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's no horny height in his story.
The battle was short.
How retarded I am!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The power grid heats the ceramic plates from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll give me back when you have the money.
Day came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm getting sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the cliffs.
Let's forget it for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll review it all.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
He's stuck in his sleeve.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
They're all gone except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's getting darker.
The pipes are closed.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They were quiet next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who'll help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make the cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm crazy.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't be so excited.
Silvia liked the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How do you feel about that?
Tom's beer from the bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You mind?
When does this start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are broken.
Tom told Mary to donate money.
I got him with me.
Didn't your name be Cookie's old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But it's been overhauled.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did she ask for money?
Hold him!
We need to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom's running down the alley.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senf's really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know he's swimming?
Do you have a chibrit?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me in the head.
Anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's just gonna have to go.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it so obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We were laughing at Tom.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was true.
Is that enough?
Tom, put your hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he'd take off his nicotine flakes if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your thoughts.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
I kind of feel wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carito right is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This was a hard night for me.
Tom was driving through town with an upstairs brake without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
You want a camping party?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to turn Mary off the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Take care of it for yourself.
You got it now, don't you?
I'm pretty invigorated.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must now be turning into a grave.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
Do you want a bowl?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't cry.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
And what does it have to do with that?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
That's how it feels.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used innocuous expressions.
Your coffee's powering up!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big mercenary for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We'll miss you, Tom.
Tom works in NASA.
Tom's writing.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you go so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as a negative.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes were bright with anger.
Why were you shouting?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom's leaving to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do everything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave me a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "So do I."
There are many birds in this forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, let's go.
He just wanted to meet me, Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom could be richer than we thought.
I never meant to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have such a wish.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soybean.
Excuse me.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
Hard wings, peppers, and livers are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to get you what you can as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom's hating his knee.
Where do the pineapple come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I have to get some rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd was rocking.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink gas drinkers.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost got a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a bunny.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going so he wants to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan drank five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking curses.
I know how it sounds.
Tom apparently didn't stop him from sitting alone.
I already feel a lot better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
Why does Tom do this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My father brought me here when I was young.
You're such a bug.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm in danger.
Tom's here early.
He was drying his wet clothes at the edge of the fire.
He's always struggling with his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have a blanket?
No part of the pig has collapsed.
She buys an everlasting bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What's going to happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What are the benefits?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl's running slow.
Turns out you're an unexpected beauty.
Your prejudices have saved you a lot of time.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom is still devastated.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always had everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know he would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom's on the ice.
I'll never capitalize.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first butterfly I've seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems happy.
Tom's not too young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda was pregnant and suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting started more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll work as I know and know.
I've got money.
You can learn here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix yourself.
Tom threw the arrow.
They're not coconuts.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a dirty dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's helpful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of mammoth is the emotional mammoth.
Let's get ourselves killed.
The bees remove the bowl to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn my back.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You brought them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom got his eyes lighted when Mary walked into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you even help us?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting next to the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There's a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you seem.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Sheep usually kill them before they're over a year old, so people eat them.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you are.
Can I see her?
He spends his money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not really sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've already told you a million times that you don't have to overdo it.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
It's hard.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's been lying to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very bad at blowing up sounds, I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Did you get scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.

Maybe we're relatives.
It's my fault I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not back.
Tom's sleeping hard.
Be smart and don't tell yours about it!
There was a stairwell in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom, you've always been very protective of your children.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six lean shirts.
I'm safe.
The witches seem strange to you.

Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom's gone.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.

Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
Do you know how to sneeze?
I have very little money.

What about a sandwich?
I know what to teach.
Hand over the compositions.

This afternoon we'll eat peanuts from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.

There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unfriendly.
Tonight's right for me.

That's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.

Has anyone hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.

Take a clean glass of the poster.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
That's all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like how the French write their word for "bubama".
The elevator can raise 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's risky without any help.
Is that what you're worried about?
We're pretty good.
The pig is cut to pieces and sprayed.
Ask a professional face.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.

I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead off.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters made a huge amount of money from the rich.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
They bite your conscience, don't they?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom's gonna explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom's got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take the scarf, your nose's running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
First of all, they were farmers.
You just need to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think he'd come back last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camoli would have stayed.
She has ten children.

Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?

Bring some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.

Tom's probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?

Good evening.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet weather conditions are not the property of the peninsula.

I'm sure Tom will know what's best for him.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never been surfing.
I'll find something.
We ate corn soup.
We can work in the open if it's light.

I spend most of my day here.
Should we wait here?
If you go out this big, you'll get it.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything to Tom?
Are they all busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was wounded.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't give up.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All stores are closed.
You were making white again!
Stop squeezing the dick.

That didn't happen.
Be a man.
No need for a drama.

There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.

Guess what happened.

No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I forgave you already.

Somehow I still don't believe it.
What's the short?
Thanks again for coming.

Let's sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We went between the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a knight.
Now we're even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I need to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch in the afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more cultural.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was snoring his bunny with his guts.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom a gift.
Tom was working.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.

She's got short hair.

I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He's down the stairs.
Can I make up something?
I need to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.

Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He has a lot of debts.
She knows the most important capitals.
What's under the roof?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom's got all the drinking tours.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom's here.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her ligature.
The teacher's teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship was sinking without delay.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
I'm in pain.
The question is who'll do it.
I'll go to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about that, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's making me nervous.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me what.
Hey, what's going on?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a windshield.
That foot goes to school.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very handsome.
Now the question is what we should do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
End up in the fourth place with 56 runners.
Don't cry.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he was obsessed with the girl who lived on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom upset Mary's silence.
They'll be there soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They weren't acting fast.
I'm weak.
It's a wheeled sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to hang out with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
The animals are threatened.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to see her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't respond right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for this weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell back.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for a reward.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are pissed off, and they're getting even better when he drinks a couple of beer.
You have merciful eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he can't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, he'll fix it... when the crow gives birth to the grapes.
Tom's a counselor.
Can I talk to you?
You insulted me by calling me an ass.
Who's got a fire from?
It's possible Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom likes you.
I haven't betrayed anything.
I thought you were just yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair's falling.
The big question of who no one found the answer, including me, despite thirty years of research on the female soul, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
The villagers are reaping harvests.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the breach?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What was the subject?
In each section, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head from me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep me lucky!
The concert's over with folk hysteria.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I've got something to do with.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's plenty of air here.
She's married to a man's zero.
The wind is sinking.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything disgusting.
The old kid before he died.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I hit him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star between billions of others.
I got some soups.
Can someone help me?
We're leaving this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google?
It's not yet spring.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most parts of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm thinking.
Are you sure we don't have to order first?
One who can hear the butterfly smiles knows and tastes like clouds.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
He wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's going to be submissive.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They've pulled the trigger to see who goes first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to eat like goods!
But if I was in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.
Did you work as a bartender so far?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I've just finished my shift.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have a flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, heat it in the microwave oven.
The flow is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want to get my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money she had saved.
I think it's time you left now.
Guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw it.
Tom's a little bit of a bitch.
Tom's very unsuspecting.
What did they mean?
How's a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's got drinks.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants revenge.
Tom put a fork in the drawer.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend.
The whales are kind of tits.
Dan took Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I completely understand.
Tom seems shaken.
Are they married?
"Did you like his music?" "No, and you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat in that restaurant.
He's about to turn around.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would you leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Swallow your hands.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's exactly what I'm worried about.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge of things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I'd never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came - as it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom raised his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The value of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the aisle.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Are you mad at Tom?
This is my newest turn.
I haven't been good for two days.
It's a waste of the brain.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between the brain and the donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Raining out does not come under consideration.
I'll tell them to go right away.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an asylum.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you in a while, guys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are some of the symptoms of being poisoned with mushrooms?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch lesbian porn.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes her homework.
I can handle it.
Can you play that keyboard chord?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right now.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already believe it.
She writes her mother's letter.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has some charm.
This is a taboo.
We barely escaped.
Did they hire you?
There's a gas flow.
Tom could see Mary texting.
You're gonna be better.
Tom was a little confused.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cross for a year.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and scratch her -- it's called sexual abuse.
I've decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped up the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was breathing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It's not happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and bet on yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was milk.
I'm waiting to change the traffic light.
The boy was quiet.
The body of the ship is divided into several watery parts.
Because of what you were cooking, I'm gonna wash the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something that doesn't tell us.
When are you going home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
There's fake traps.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear that?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's no longer such a shy boy as he was.
You're counting?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys divided into groups everywhere. Some played jams, some tiles, some ball. Others rode a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Suspect destroys friendship.
I want to keep you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
Not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is a relief from whatever pleasure it may have.
Nice of you to buy Tom a gift like that.
You have to go home.
Come this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We'll find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait for me to check the manual.
The energy comes from inside.
Nobody trusts them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You've hit your head.
We're stuck.
Get the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to the concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that was there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's weird how people in the tropical areas eat cooked food like a cari.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom had no family.
I can't determine who loves the baby, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom's got a terrible gut.
I grow orchids in my bottle.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim was never a stranger.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom was fighting.
I said maybe he'll turn around.
I need you to open my door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix the candles?
Go ahead.
I forgot his address.
Are you handy?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her basement has a slick on one side.
Let's get something late.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm fine.
She can't read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail sometime.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom, you've made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
It's sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
I'm sorry, I don't have a prayer.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first one to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Guess how much money we'll need next year.
I burned the cyber in the dark.
How much does she do to that?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Do you get up at 6:00?
Tom's sitting back.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom's spending too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was burning my lungs, I was just choking in my room, waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom's playing on the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard exactly.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did all he could.
He's greedy.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking any chances.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a runner.
Tom doesn't listen.
They love everything you said you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the matter?
Is that necessary?
Tom's staying.
I'll never give up on you.
He did it to make it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dry.
I thought I was asking for their help.
Maybe it'd be best if you called them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do about this?
Is your dog lying?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I really like German donuts.
At the time, we were 18 years old.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I want broccula, but I hate carp.
I don't like seeing him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running away.
Go on with it.
This is negative.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They drank you.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
He's being polite.
You're great.
Tom's lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and imagine your wish.
Come on, open it.

I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
Don't burn.

I'd like to see him as soon as possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary doesn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joke.
It was much worse for me.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.

Tom's heart's broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth.
They've all been checked.
Every customer has his own rights.
I'm only calling you as much as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What'd you do the last time?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is a pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car's ruined.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This may hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They choose us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't invite him to a party often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not really in danger.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you wet yourself?
Did you change the shampoo?

They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They don't have a defense.
He often helps others.

Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.

I'll accept anything.
It won't be okay.

What are your favorite French wines?
It'll be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom was obviously used to such problems.
You'll be all right.
It was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I poured coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom's healthy.

Tom's got them.
I'm a little thirsty.

What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was it one of them?
He's got a little bet.
I'll make sure we finish this project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You're pushing too hard when you're holding your hand.
What if we don't find them?

You won the first place at the game.
I just want you to come back to me.

Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late last night.
You're disgusting.
Everybody was quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
He gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's weird.
No one can save himself from death.
It won't help you.

Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
You stuck this song in my head.

No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So I'm serious.

I'm gonna have to try and deal with this alone.

Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The time in April is unperceived.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut off the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom's running out of nowhere.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left uneaten food on the table.
Tom's changing direction.
There's no living man in the school.
The rocket flew.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little damp.
Tom just came to visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to look busy, so that Mary would not ask him to help her.
I eat meat very rarely.
I'll go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers come in fast after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do it for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I was eating late last night.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We've been spending our money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
You don't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never ventured to be anything but what I am.
Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether Tom is happy or not.
This doesn't make me hot.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Can you imagine a wish?
Children are sometimes afraid of the darkness.
Stand aside.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom, keep going.
Cuban hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them waving.
It's a shame I didn't drive by the wheel here.
I need to visit Tom.
What are you uncomfortable about?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I'm not wearing provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Let me be damned!
I'd walk alone first.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I've motivated you.
I don't want to sleep with you.
I didn't see where you put the keys to your car.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give them a chance.
He showed up all of a sudden.
I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's trading half-cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You've done the wrong thing.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too expensive.
Who was the thief?
He's got a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the photos doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I didn't know if to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're totally safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come visit us next month?
The puppets run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls hit her because of her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure pushed him down.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
The beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants harm the bee’s health.
Now you can go.
They're slowing down.
Tom's a second year.
If I can understand, then everyone can.
Tourists weren't satisfied.
Tom's got the socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom, you bastards.
Laws are like spiders - they hunt muscles, but they let the bones and the wounded break through.
You're too proud of a pawn.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his desk key, just like he was used to.
He took off his fur coat down, got up, and knocked gently on the door.
Tom seems so happy.
We don't look at the same subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was on Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're all set.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm happy to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't want tennis.
How long has Tom been here?
He's sending messages to his boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to do that again?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
The handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my will.
"Why did you break my badge?" "Dear dear."
We were very close.
It goes down there every day.
Give me your knife.
Nobody's defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked you not to interfere.
Tomorrow's not a big day.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Wait for me to be surprised.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now she's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why are you crying, Tom?
That's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can hug me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
Camley, I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat's got his claws in my hand.
"When did you sleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What? What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with the former."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed by something else.
His heart was broken by unrelenting love.
When's it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're bothering me.
His rank isn't high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional chair.
Tom is not as naive as many people think.
I hit a box in his jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going for lunch.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not a Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
They all rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old money.
There's a lot to say.
I hear what you're saying.
We have to face the facts.
No harm.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them in bed.
The only thing Tom's putting on meat is a pepper.
That's what I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
She fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic accident.
I brought a few bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why does Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How do many names form?
You saved my life.
It was too much.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
You got me a bad ass off of him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be abnormal to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't even get angry.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom's supposed to be bottled.
Get me some coffee.
You're gonna be okay.
That was a fake trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in jail for spying.
Can we help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are read only by a wolf.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a razor.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna keep my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear grief in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I would do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something you don't think.
I decorated my room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what he's like.
Leave Tom to make his safe.
Our kangaroo was approaching the little island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute. I'm done with my laundry. I'm going to deliver it.
Tom was a miner.
It's all white.
Where would I have had enough strength of will to keep my diet?
The man in question is currently in America.
He's considered guilty.
I'll look at Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here the first time.
That tube sounds very bad to me.
I'm tired of my eyes.
I need to get away from her.
Tom earns $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Do you expect them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
One boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by with a wheel.
When was the last time the baby was born?
I'm a little bit hurt by my muscles.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm a scratch.
They'll fire me because I'm too late for work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a couple of vows.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
He's always nice.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Honey, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Are you still working on the freezer?
The city restored that old, historic building.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's really proud.
Tom came back covered with mud.
That's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I have nothing else.
Tom's in the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom booked a seat.
I want to use this.
What color were Tom's socks?
Tom made me a cake.
I've never been a jury before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't want to be touched.
Look at the clouds.

Tom ended up as a winner.
Tom's here right now.
I'm here to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.

Tom's gone to the corner.
He's back at 6:00.
It has been proved that the pain in dogs jumps higher than the pain in cats.
Watch out when you get up on the stairs.
Were you with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this made of?
The Butler opened the door.
Tom was wrong.
Get your hands off me.
Don't say that name about me.
Are you gonna throw that?
Tom has a good profession.
They're my stuff.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom, change the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It's a very nice feeling.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this over.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a disastrous failure.
Just got back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you come to Boston?
I'm late for something.
The caves contain significant amounts of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom went back to work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.

Most people are more afraid of making a mistake than of making a mistake.
This is a stupid question, but who's stronger, a lion or a tiger?
We'll have company.
We're students.
Tom took the cover out of the champagne.
It's a missing girl.
Tom despises your stubbornness.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of places he wanted to visit.
From his point of view, I concluded that he was angry with me.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me red and white roses.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
He shot three times.
I'll be sorry if I like it.
They're gratis.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in chorus.
There's no more words to say.
You can make it easier for yourself.
You know what I'm saying.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom's not going to the market.
Give me a few minutes.

Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see him.
Tom was just a bit of a joke.
I'll find out who did this.

Have you found her yet?
Tom's alone there.
You've done your job well.

I'll take you home.
Does the stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not taking me off.
Try to wash yourself.
I think I love you.
I'm taking care of all of you.
It's quiet next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't get drunk now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I'd like to get help with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
That was an amazing night.
The smells of jasmine and lavender are my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom was obviously bored.
She's very personalistic.
The knife had a very old top.
Get ready.
Put him down here.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if I burned you and you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your watch.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them are sleeping.
Did everyone agree?
These are my prayers.
Aren't you going?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely hot.
No one wanted to get off the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom passed by.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.
The hearts of the broken mirror were scattered on the floor.

Play that song again.

That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorn.
Tom put a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
Should we call him?

What are languages and not tastes?

What's Tom afraid of?
Tom would object.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
He's here to play cards.

What were they doing?
I think you should end this by yourself.
As far as I can see, nothing's on Tom from a medical point of view.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
Tom seems confidential.
Shame on you!

That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
Camley, I didn't marry Tom.
I know what it is.
When does Tom arrive?
Could you give me the remote control?
I'll get him to take out your lawn.
- You're helping once.
We were crying in a duet.
I'll set the table.

I must've forgotten.

It'll be beastly.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not exactly normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?

The forest is my home.
There's a swelling on your head.

I need peace and quiet after working hard.
If you ignore the past, you threaten the future.

How's it going, Tom?
The wind changed its direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you came?
I can't get an asylum from Tom.
Camley, I'd known this before.
Is there something missing?
I didn't do that for him.
She felt quite lonely.
I'm going hunting for free time.
Where did my driver go?
He's got a flaw in it.
The coat is covered with fur.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I've been reported.
He was sleeping hard.
I had no doubt about that.
The pins are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't experience it that way.
Tom was sitting on the stairs talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you had.
I always eat.
Tom gave Mary a message from John.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not some big sailor.
My dad got a light on the white drops last month.
What a sad story!
Try to get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'm gonna live long.
You need to help her.
Take care of him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom's playing in a band and he's very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom's interest faded.
Let's play a fight.
It was fun yesterday.
Tom may help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating after restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.

Did you admit that?
Tom's a diabetic.
Call him whatever you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They were verbally abused.
Why were you chasing me?
I was pretty busy.
I couldn't do what you were doing.
Are you always busy?
Tom, you heard him.
You're below her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help a person who owns it.

I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up thinking he was going to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom works efficiently.
I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take it with him.
It's not about luck.
I think you know the rules.
I'm sincerely complaining about it.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back in six.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The lamb looked at her.
I have to turn the phone off.
Time's good.
This was wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan was seen talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom did it with ease.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a glass in front of my house.
He's the owner of the company.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
It won't get better.
He's already done his job.
My ears are stuck.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to get stressed out.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston in two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's going to school for the deaf.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very safe.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I stayed so long.
I don't want to wait.
What is it, to be invisible to him?
The radio's off.
I turned him down, Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in the bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and a point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do all we can.
I'll pay.
It's quite possible Tom can't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I came here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envy is a sin.
All the kids are strangers.
I got shot.
Tom's not a dramatist.
I've completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't decide not to look through the key.
Tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That column isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did anyone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We have to get back.
I think so.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I was thinking of visiting the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They chased you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no living soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging you wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you very much.
You're cooking nice.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to the breach.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep him?
Tom's paid a lot.
It was sad.
Looks like you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
The automatic cars are now distributed.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give yourself up.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's the new money.
I've got Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organ was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
Does his aunt eat apples or bananas?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making kygan.
I love the blue color.
The girl freed the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't suck my coffee.
Tom gave your daughter a sheed.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play ass?
They picked her up pretty good.
What does that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you my own, but I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a bore I spent the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and was released from parental control.
Tom's a wreck.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census took place in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me a Quaker, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He's dressed up for a bath.
The river from the pod began to lean on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became an unbeliever.
Let's just drop it.
I'm learning math.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you do?
The movies are a great occasion.
At first, I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight because of unfavorable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices loud.
They can come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against that.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right away, Tom.
That wasn't exactly it.
I'll go see what I can find.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's close.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get so bad.
It's not getting out of the blanket.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to watch over Mary.
Mary wants to drink hot coffee and Tom's milk.
- I gave you a fake address.
I'm out.
I'm not angry anymore.
It's a great chance Jane's coming.
I hate it.
I think so.
I think you've panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl's got a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think about Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's snooping.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna be?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I've got a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm done.
The question is whether or not it can.
Tom's running upstairs.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to do this to work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls that were inferior to you.
I have to put my belt on.
Tom was about to meet Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping on standby.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's wrong with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd Tom get caught?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on in time.
The Germans have a weak attitude toward the naked.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's sleeping.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large grave.
Women want men with mustaches.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
Camley, I could have been like Tom.
I suddenly heard a loud noise.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't even lucky.
His body was raised with brown skin.
Tom didn't want Mary crying.
I'm really mad at Tom.
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who'll help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The people on the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always loved secret characters more.
Drop my ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the fora with the hat?
Tom is one of the most prominent American songwriters.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom wishes he'll never come back here again.
No one likes posters.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the remote mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's really fucked.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We got there first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'm happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate very good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got kicked.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary buys smelly garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He's used to working in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where to hide Tom's diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's good to remember.
Can he do anything he wants to do?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We have bad news for them.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
The cocaine is drugs.
This is a little difficult.
Apparently you already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood stole the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was for our great benefit.
What do you usually do at leisure?
I'll come and save you.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was boneless coffee.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I'm never looking for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to thank you.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a few doughnuts.
I teach French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was thoughtless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We need to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him a little alone.
I never wear clothes.
The grill's broken.
He's gone.
His clients make up mostly poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why do you mind?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women want men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I care about them.
People die all the time.
He's too perfect for him.
Can you make that stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You pulled your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't like to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this afternoon.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom's got a broken brain.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the cream.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back.
Marco thinks he's writing.
Tom looked.
My ears are shaking.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very well arranged.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such an asshole!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They were laughing.
She'll be a teacher.
I don't mean to tell Tom that.
I'd like marine fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems upset.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Did you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that's what stopped us?
Maybe we can find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's okay.
You're capable, but you're suffocating.
He worked in an embassy three months ago.
We're out now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's pissed off.
It's from work.
We'll manage.
The commendations encourage students to work better.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two.
Tom measured his weight.
I'm sure something happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for noblemen.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Do you believe that?
How to choose one man?
I came here to feed Tom's fish.
Actually, I came here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My uncle's poor uncle was there, spread out on the bloody bed, with a stick pointed deep into his heart.
Someone is trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you be staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your kid's laugh.
Tom suspected that Mary and I were doing something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins in disputes.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder?
Don't interfere with work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll meet you guys.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't be mad at Tom.
I turned on the fan and turned it on the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
No examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a brick tomb behind the mud.
Tom writes very well.
That's not quite true.
The rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he grew older, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank borrowed a million dollars from the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what is important to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play relaxed.
My son always interrupts me while I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much last night.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he couldn't figure out what his name was.
I'll get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to borrow me an interesting book?
Tom was moving carefully.
Just get inside.
He took a sword from the steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise you, I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's a unit.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more of them than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's pissed off.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't bear it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are next.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
Which college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It seemed much more than I expected.
Clear your eyes.
Tom just got inside.
I've had a bloody break in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
He's over it!
There's a son missing.
I'm trying to work.
What do you like?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show's gonna give up; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's on his way.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorance.
Do you often swim Tom?
The girl's asleep.
Go write home.
Don't force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
I want to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom looks dirty.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone's got their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I've got the impression he's been back all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come by car.
Thank you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had a suitcase less than I did, they complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live in any part of Eastern Europe?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a cracker named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd take the bartender down.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Remember what you were wearing when I met you?
The molars usually join the thunderstorms.
Tom wants tea with the cement.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I've got a little temperature.
Tom cornered the ground.
There's no end to this lecture!
The glasses are in the cup holder.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to mess with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time to change.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's a British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How do you still not sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's unable to do that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two years in tropical areas.
I think I've made myself clear.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Do you think about them?
Actually, I'm back with the ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's beautiful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say on the door?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she keeps her head remind me of Mary.
Don't block my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would've come back.
She always works worth it.
What state are you a citizen?
Trade in elephant bones is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I like dogs more than cats.
There is still little space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared so much about Tom.
I was home.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
This heat is not supported.
It seems these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You were brave, weren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't like it that way.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep doing your job.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a lonely man, you can say.
I can't handle this.
Looks like we're gonna have to do more.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for mother in Boston?
First of all, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree's floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing it together soon.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
Put your hands together.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom's never been sitting long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa have died as a result of the storm.
What did you wear?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
All right.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have every disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought there were bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's some more tea in the cupboard.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
I was nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was everything just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is that Tom?
I have problems with the sinuses.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's out of water.
Esperante doesn't belong to anyone.
She's handcuffed with chicken.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They dropped the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three Chedas.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
He's been back for a week, up and down.
He slowly recovers from the disease.
I want a vertigo.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's on the roof.
Her face was bitten by sperm.
Tom's just.
You have to do this first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's done to me tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thank you for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It is from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Bet you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
That's why they ordered him to leave the company.
I'd understand what you're up to.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom has to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was a Bosnian.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom, get up.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, and I don't even know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Sheika blew the tire.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make her take out your lawn.
Tom's a math guy.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder it is, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom was always stubborn.
You make bread in your ovens.
You're crazy.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and starch.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They knocked on the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That's so terrible.
I'll get her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It's still not working.
Cite an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was it honest?
The Filjan was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give up.
They're getting closer.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire lived in a dead coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise in his eye.
Tom's firm is under threat.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I passed this afternoon, Tom was still on his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is clouded.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can smile at me.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Molja hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never go there again.
I'm filming.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got work to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscope?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I thought about it.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from my list.
Tom has arranged all this.
I'm not gonna betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is milk.
First, there was no growing life in this climate.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I was supposed to do.
Tom's far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not a scientist.
She's got tight ass.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, that violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
Mr. Kimura is waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was released to the gentleman.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you ask for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers at the desk.

Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom's still not speaking French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
Moral choice is for the translator whether to translate or not. Some things are better left in the language he produced.
You're mean.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Will you eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was a ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a great crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in his eyes and laughed.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's already too late.
If you'd found them.
I couldn't sleep again.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need any enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're kidding.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's naked.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Maybe someone's been following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure right.
We went on the coast.
I don't want you to abuse them.
Depends on your decision.
That's executive.
Tom reacts badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic drinks?
Tom was talking about you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a pleasure for her to meet her lawyer.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's stuck.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom's a fire extinguisher and he's starting to spray.
She's a tennis player.
I wasn't in Boston the night they killed Tom.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Who are these?
Speak for yourself.
You've been working with a lot of trouble.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think he's gonna fall for it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we agreed?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold on.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so the conscience really does make us all cowards.
You don't have to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom set up the box.
I should've checked.
He couldn't take off his pants.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You've made a mistake.
It's good to see you.
You must leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
English became my favorite object.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The wound on your knee is now rotting.
Clear your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't have thrown anything away.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Who's Tom sleeping from?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
Blood's now broken into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't a man who's easy to agree with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea urchin.
This was a crime of preconceivedness.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The kids drew pictures on the sidewalk with credit.
You're wondering what you've been holding on so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monasteries live in the monastery.
I went twice to Boston.
Tom's married to 26 years.
We've already cleared that.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking friends.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom is always trying to act the way he thinks is right.
Apparently, Tom often doesn't understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to be proud of the magnificent examples she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you got in the bowl?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
It's a good swim.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom came.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Didn't I do something to make Tom mad at me?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light here to read.
Tom was counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the carmine away.
Let me guess.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let this stay between us.
I've been looking everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as it breaks.
Mr. Gorbachev, break down the wall!
Tom seems surprised.
Tom wrote down.
It's the way it should be.
Let's try and agree.
That'll be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thank you for asking.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl who wears a joke is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loving.
I can't control it.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll come by the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I'm not very dear to Tom.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you see?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the phrases?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home on Friday night when I was thirteen years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You just made me sick.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's so angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said we should stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satisfy my thirst.
Tom's here in time.
Today's boring TV.
Oh, great!
Tom found the kid with four leaves.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found the evidence.
We got to say good-bye to them.
Didn't you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nobody and nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's a law!
The water's breaking down the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's here safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the rumors that fly from the fire.
It's just made up.
Tom was quiet all night with Mary.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I've been dreaming about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul together.
I'm sure he'll put on the closer test.
Let's go to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He's passionately kissed her in his mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom's turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cake.
He was quite restrained.
I can end up with Tom.
Tom's getting pissed off.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all the money from Tom.
Enough of the crap.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always loved his son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom's getting hooked.
The peppers are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work earlier.
We have everything.
I made him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unmistakable.
His girlfriend's weak.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from the nightmare.
Tom's got a weak look.
The twin didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where are you going with Tom?
Is coffee hot?
Tom shut his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put on your seatbelt.
It's possible you're wrong.
I also baked the cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisers about what subjects to take.
I already wrote everything I had to write.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's no one in the school.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's point.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I never change my sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Did you see him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll take you.
I set him up, Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom knows he's very vengeful.
I've seen it take place.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're so stubborn.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Dada really very nice today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just showering.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're modeled.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I've had breakfast today.
My pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They blew up the tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and tied another one to that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Bloods in no way are clear.
That was very rude by Tom.
It's dirty.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm mad.
Let them take you down.
Securitization is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are heavy and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with or without you.
Let's say for now that you're right.
Tom's going great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot here.
That's what disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I don't understand.
Tom's an asshole.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You didn't thank us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look like each other.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'll take care of it.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a table.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We both better get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fussy.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't cry.
He wrote a book, and that's great.
Tom flipped the quack.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm looking at ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is sadder than stupidity and indifference.
They're all circling.
Tom didn't protest.
What do the websites stop from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate bats.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I've been cleaning up the snow all day.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
The changes are never easy.
Is it far from Boston?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a paper and read it on the train as he went to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the lid out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the jacket.
The pigeons symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Annie's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I'm sure I'm losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
He's sleeping with me.
There is no scientific evidence that there is a connection between the character and the blood group.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom was brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a men's product.
We've been looking all over for them.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Push this button.
Tom's really capable of fighting.
What's bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom smashed his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All gooseberries are carrying eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I'm looking at how things are.
I'm making very stupid decisions.
Let's move on to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where'd Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out of here.
His words sound reasonable.
In India there are many rivers.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom wants adventures.
They don't have a shed.
Lots of trees fell.
Lions don't make any difference in color.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want you to get my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really nice time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are now married.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you're married to Tom.

Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm uploading the calendar to the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
What couldn't you sleep from last night?
They don't even throw a curse.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.

I don't know the end of the story.
We're done.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
I think you're weak.
I know you don't speak French.
- Did he call you?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for receiving me.

Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's getting into the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom, wipe your face.
What benefit do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.

Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.

I'm too late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.

There are reports for writing.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask.
Just watch it.

This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like how it sounds.
That should be possible.

Can you just go home?
Do you know the real words?
I'm in terrible pain here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was cut off.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.

I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's running down.
Tom gave the word.
Tom and Mary left us the first day.
Let's get together.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure that's exactly what Tom did.
"Will you not eat the Spanish?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom's taking down the shed.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.

Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.

I'm collecting stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
The room looks like a cat.
I'm not talking about him.

We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.

I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you going to wear your clothes this year?

Do you want to talk to me?

I'm thirsty for him.
She's looking at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.

You've been pushing me a lot.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice man.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You don't ask why.

Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.

He's very kind, just like you.
I'll go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.

He's got an appetite from a long walk.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself with a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way to get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
The wedding must be perfect for me.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Did he study outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's broken.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Did you write in the journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can you do it on your own?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you bending?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
Up and down we're ready.
Tom's got an old hearing.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
I don't like him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take your hat off.
I helped him figure out the table.
I was eating corn with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up in two and a half.
Tom's missing.
I slept in my lap.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't you cold by short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need a cover.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was slang first.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife confirm her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look into a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe he didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you some cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real damage.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
You got me on the head.
You must be careful.
Tom seems suspended.
You're having fun going on with your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How don't you know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It smells like meat.
Do I need to know you?
Tom's been cleverly hiding all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't care.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just pulled Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it were higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets very much.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bastard.
We despise her.
He's here in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom's working on the table the new mash he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's on the run.
The landscape is excellent.
It's locked.
I found your papals under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'm gonna try and get some rest.
Essena's here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic?
The water only needs three minutes to speak.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was great.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience, and they should treat one another in the spirit of general humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They're kissing.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything alone.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup's oversold.
Why don't you go get him?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to figure it out.
Nothing's gonna cost you to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked at the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
I think it's familiar.
- I'm jealous.
I offered to smoke his dick, but he told me he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It's got its boundaries.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosiloc, jacinth, rosemary, temian, and organ are popular plants.
We're disgusting.
You're a smart man.
It seemed all right.
Leave this here.
He's sitting on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'll go to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew he couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
Maybe she's been cheating on you, but I'm not!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him everything.
I'm getting hurt.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a buyer.
It's just to solve this problem.
They must remove the bullet that stuck to his back.
It's funny.
Does Tom look upset?
If possible, this weekend.
I know how you probably sound.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but apparently I lost your sunburn.
I don't have a sword.
Suspected confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to kick you alone.
We import grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pens, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the daytime?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like we're not considering asking Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are you calorific?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary off the tail.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't delay you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him grizzles.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and your phone number?
Tom was throwing me with a stone.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad about Tom?
Tom will be here a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing under a line in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a couple of reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all undercover.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days before Christmas?
He wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The deaf are transporters to the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's making a statement.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write so well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I want baked bones.
What did Tom do here?
She fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic accident.
They beat us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a mutiny.
It's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French very well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with something?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get involved.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too dry for him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early to come?
It sounds pretty loud.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom's got them on the ropes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called a fire.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was this all the excitement?
Tom's going somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The mailman called.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's a silent fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is blue.
We don't talk much.
You're a loving man.
Tom's getting a little chilly.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Madeline.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
You're going through some kind of titties.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big tender.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the will going?
He wiped his wet hair off with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was shaking his hands.
Open the teapots.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the parachutist.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do everything.
Tom's gone to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't want puzzles.
The book will help you write your skills.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please blow up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm going to have my toasts with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I've got a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the pope escaped from the cage.
We went to pick up strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sun views.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw out his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was doing the cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call whenever.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom's squeezing.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had an infection of the bladder.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to take off the kilage.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we took it.
How do we benefit from that?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick fight.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary may agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were just confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom doesn't care about sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I wasn't sorry about them.
Tom feels he needs to be redeemed.
This message is for them.
When am I gonna get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised his knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
He rubbed the dog with a stone.
Tom kept staring.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demec, I wrote this book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be fooled.
They looked around.
Tom looked through the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the seed floor, you have to extract it.
Tom's not good today.
We don't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
Okay, convince me.
Now I'm ready for him.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go together.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly.
I agreed.
Tom admitted he had his red wine poured out.
You want a dog?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is goodness.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Did you hear about us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'd love to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your things are here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedantic in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
Don't be alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I do every day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom's turned to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan's turned into a question.
You've got a lot of hairy eyes.
Isn't that what you mean?
I thought he was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let her in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom looks rich.
Tom seems more confident.
Would you like to drink some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They've developed addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat there and kept quiet.
Get the shovel.
You have very different kinds of people here.
Mary got into her mother's arms.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the table.
Tom wipes out the knife from the farms.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your balls bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beers on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
I've got a seductive look.
Don't be ashamed.
I don't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My dad's very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Are you going to get down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
You looked me through the glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that she was demonized.
Why would they mind?
Let's not bother Tom.
It's tough.
I just need a break.
I got a warrant for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave like this.
I need to get rid of us.
Why is heaven blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did he hurt Tom?
Who could break the aquarium?
He came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
Should I take your bags?
I'd trust them with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What are you gonna worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is rising.
There were penguins on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called for a helmet.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope you like the new boss.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She's studying English.
With such a tremendous dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end poverty.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom blew the chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving me birth.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
Probably won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was born interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked strong.
What do you want me to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was a Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are afraid enough, everything can happen.
You're a narrow town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck's stuck.
Grab the day.
What's Tom's bell?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer watch out.
Tom's been running for hours.
Now it's time for a replacement.
Most virgins have a complete hymen.
You can get out of here.
Why did you blow up only two sausages?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll manage.
Is that dog there?
I'm resting.
Mary was carrying false tricks.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How long do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's an American.
Relax a bit.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed upset.
Please tell them what to do.
The bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I'm deciding, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
That's good.
Tom's getting sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never find out.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got rid of him.
I prefer goat cheese than cow.
We understand that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten milk products in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Did you meet Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been awake all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know it's yours.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The barns are cutting wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zine by the end.
Single couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was a body once.
Give them the picture.
Tom was buried alive.
It's a hand-held job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
Let me try that.
Can you turn that cigarette off?
What were they laughing at?
Why would you believe her?
What's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There is still no sign of Tom’s voice.
That's when I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The Alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
The table is plastic.
Sunlight is the alleged best means of disinfection.

I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They were killed.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
You hung me up.
Did you call for quick help already?
After lunch, our plan is to walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
It's turned on red light.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
Now we need it.
I don't know what you're looking for here.
Blood runs through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My right leg hurts.
The apple's healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we coming from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a chopper?
Tom's in the oven for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't know English. I don't know Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't mean anything like that.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a handcuff.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I expect visitors.
They saved the whole team.
What age did you begin to menstruate at?
You're scaring me.
But not in front of people.
The company's bankrupted.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very talkative.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
You gonna eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, it'll hurt.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't make Tom mad.
It's a tough task.
You should make him listen.
I'm surprised it's so easy.
Camoli would have been here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, darling.
They have increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have already known about it.
My mother's sister and my aunt.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom's incompetent.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
He's gone red.
I have to go.
Whoever sleeps with dogs wakes up with pain.
His aunt's all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll turn around tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hung up his head.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these thoughts.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we win Tom.
Take your things off.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
My headache's gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I fell out of the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom took the joke off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was standing in the middle of a tunnel.
Tom's a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the claws.
Hazels love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my hip.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would you lie to Tom?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid we don't lose money.
Tom swallowed his ex.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his dad very much.
Let's get up there.
It's not that we're doing something.
Tom's had a good time today.
Milton hasn't been sleeping well for weeks.
When's the big day?
I was working for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you getting ready for?
Now this is your house.
How about you try some sushi?
How are you?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
Camoli, if I could live my life doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there were no charges.
The hunt is one of the seven fatalities.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary ready to say something.
I'm not gonna be in town next week.
They sown seed, raised it up, and gave it to the husbandmen; and the river, when it had turned into a stream, brought forth its fruit.

Tom helped us escape.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom takes Mary home.
I ski a lot.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm as qualified as Tom.
When will my turn come?
Tom failed.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
Obviously it's a print error.
It doesn't happen very often that someone buys a hat of a thousand dollars.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan laughed at the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely got caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be in.
History is writing the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the snow?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing's bothering me here.
You cheated on me.
It's for the heat.
Nothing's sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're breaking her up.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was at three points.
I'm here to talk about her.
We've got fish for dinner today.
I don't eat at restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
I guess you've got an infection.
There's nothing more clever than that.
The sky is red in summer.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd love to see you too.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I speak English badly.
We'll deal with it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan's got this right.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them.
Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
They all love him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot here in hell.
I've seen that.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Children, you stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Are you kidding your dog?
That's great!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go get them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.

I hate that tube.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxed.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
Camley, I wouldn't have done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why does no one want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom's playing the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to carry such gifts.
I humiliated him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long does it take?
I'm fine, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting darker.
Tom was raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.

What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?

His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know that Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do something that will remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I got the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a curse.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, it's coming back.
Ish, you bastard!
They're stuck in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we've had enough.
This is very difficult for them.
The witches don't cry.
Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks thin.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can carry you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be like this.
I don't think I've ever been so scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to get him back.
You're uncultural.
Are you sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring him in.
Tom lied to us all the time.
Tom wasn't told to help us.

The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's totally incorrect.
I'd better call her first.

I'm just practicing to look nice when I'm naked.
Thousands of years are a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
It's an honest word.
We've got three guards working in a different way.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Can you imagine in a few words?
Tom was here.
I want you to call them.
Get your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I've been away for three hours.
I want crossword puzzles.
I was expecting them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom closes his mouth.
So you don't hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not hell.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a pensioner.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave his parents ’ home.
Tom gave up.
The eyes are barely visible.
Tom's an uncle.
I'll take you home.

Tom got out of jail.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to burn green.
Do you want me to bite your shoulders?
Get up on my head.
I've been right with my head.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm leaving.
I'm gonna change my clothes.
You dropped my earphone.
Maybe it sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom's still working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, I'm gonna break my movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, it could have happened here.
Tom was hot in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.

Write to Tom.

Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?

Tom always pisses me off.
Tom's just looking.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He came back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I made an apple pie.
The spear of the horse's spear calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing modest clothes all the time.
You didn't smoke?
They let me go.

These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom was connected to Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna need Tom's permission.
His joke didn't all smile.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day are too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I danced with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You'd do the same for me.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I was smiling.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop lying to each other.
Try to figure this out.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I gather a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times more than I do.
I cried one.
Write your birth date.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
I'll call him later.
These are as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're wasting our time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to our party.
Just try and find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom was visiting Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It will help her to sleep the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll wash the dishes.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Dolcun has been doing very intensive work lately, but he can't even see the slightest result of it.

I'm making dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not sure.
That's not necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping hard.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She was dreaming of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You've got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming through.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
He spent the night drinking in a meat basket.
I'm inside.
Do you need a rent?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I believed him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to take your time.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a no-brained joke.
I wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the grapes.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel free.
Just smile and keep smiling.
I didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary get out of jail.
Tom doesn't have any tea.
I'm tired.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a drink.

That's a good system.
I don't remember Tom so high.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How did you get on vacation?
At the time, we were only a few people in the gorilla group.
She began to rub her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
You travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about your back pain?
That's what everyone does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom's collecting stamps.
I want you to find her.
The sun's water.
And it's a lot that consists of members B, B and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happy if you three came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom's got teeth on his lips.
The kids are sucking bubbles.
Tom exercises violin at least half an hour each day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so funny.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
Camoli Tom had more time for me.
I'm digging for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
You're burning the car.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the power of will when it comes to exercise.
Come on to Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's ash.
For your sake.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that kind of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more I have, the more I need to clean up.
I got a solution!
I didn't see Tom.
Don't forget to smack with the sun cream.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice barely heard.
Don't you get caught.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days is it usually necessary to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reorder.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good with me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love looking for words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
I'm hungry for you to lean on.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon slowly went down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you came?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures to me don't matter.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Merisole and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something that will get our minds off the problems.
I called you yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was an inn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't have done it on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the question to eight pieces.
Maybe you'll need it.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie this knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new hand watch.
It doesn't look very different.
It's being studied.
Tom and make Mary's room on the bench.
We're kicking him.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I'm happy or not.
Did you get her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse is up and down right.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary left the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do it on my own.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than that other house.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines and the night shines.
No one's gonna get fired.
There's nobody else.
When I was traveling to New York City from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I don't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom's got a fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
He who pays the bills has the right to be master.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some cheese.
When will you visit us?
Every day tragedy happens.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening well.
Give me those letters.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like it.
All comments are excessive.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?
Tom cried his mouth out.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not in error.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Goodness without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I slept there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints have upset me.

We're all pioneers.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.

While eating pizza, he was bored with his sister.
We should've given up before.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been lost.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the door.
Tom lets the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be next to you.
I think we're close to the solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not gonna kneel.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna blow it.

These are great.
Tom's got his hands busy.
Tom was upset.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a fraud.
Where did Tom work?
I need to be proud of them.
The noise has disturbed the whole city.
Anyone who wants flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.

Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have little breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was happening.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing aggressive clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
Women don't love you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I lay down, I had three pills against my stomach.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a blurry brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you want movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to make conclusions, secondly, your argument was based on invalid assumptions.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm raising goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.

Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and stubborn.
Camoli, I could have helped you more.
Tom's out of sight.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, and when I passed by it with a car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it only possible to have this?
We'll take care of this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This must stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting around the floor.
Tom, forget about it.
Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do that without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
- . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is not related to the subject.
I'll be back in a while.
She looked like she was deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, we'll get the same.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm getting divorced.
That dinner.
My weight's flowing.
They're gonna make you a mustache.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the wires broke.
The gazer threw out the mud hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home I could go back to.
I'm here by my will.
It's to protect you.
I've always been helped by someone.
They don't want it.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you connect to him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't care about math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older ones.

I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her.
It'll be over in a little while.
I didn't say I would.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's talking.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the semen.
It's not too early.
May I eat?
They painted the frames of the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I'm flattered.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing his blood.
I have to stay here.
Everything or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic drinks?
Me and you will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom doesn't listen.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the branch with the clown and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone laughed at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to set aside time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was struggling to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna do to them?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
It's not the right time now.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep all of a sudden.
It took a lot more than I thought it would.
Tom's running by Mary's.
A cat scratched me.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Was there a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom's got brown hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's very strong.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I was bitten by my conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
The frogs are wonderful creatures.
There are three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom was drunk with tequila.
My grandmother's deaf, in other words, a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're a lot of bluff.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I give you my respect.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was the trip nice?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom collected his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most trusted counselor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a hand watch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He's changing things.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom's on his way up.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
You lied to me in your eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to change.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just stop Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I've learned it for the best.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, so speak in a manner.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's you for now.
That's a very consistent explanation.
The snacks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them on their own.
Wasn't it horrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom wore his shirt at the same time.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The evening was really good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is switchable, and division is not.
I'm in a hurry.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what it says in today’s newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom's out loud.
It was Bether.
Tom started to scream.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We're saving two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone showed up for her.
Maybe Tom will die by the morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was out of his mind.
It's empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to be listening to Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxes his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money's clouded my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all cheering for her.
Didn't you see the lead flag?
Relax!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't understand you.
Although I am a devout man, I am a man.
Tom's sorry he's late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to look into something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't go out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you feeling?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in Meana.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole city around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The doctor must drink on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
My guilt has fallen.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you an everlasting bread.
The marzipan pigs don't grow.
Tom's conscious.
Tom pissed off Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's got it for him.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't make a difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no power of will.
Will you help?
Don't let me down.
Tom wasn't home when I came home.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, now.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They dig a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure yet.
Each member must attend.
You didn't understand her scream.
This is the worst snow I've ever seen.
She's hoping to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf kit?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Bread is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreeed with Mary on that subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today's my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are very sweet together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's the luck?
Dan injured Linda's dog.
You scratched your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was found.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop by the way.
I heard Tom laugh.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So didn't you know you were playing the piano?
It's time to close.
Leave me alone.
The stone ran down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy.
Come on again!
Don't make his heart.
You don't have to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At the time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin is very sweet.
You're such a jerk.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
You were right here.
They look spooky.
I could make it easier for you.
Put your phone down.
He'd never come out of the house after the papacy.
I think Tom's a cepedal.
It's a terrible infection and the egg came out.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't make sense.
It doesn't matter.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's sometimes acting weird.
We're gonna hang them.
Now is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we make a cupcake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him now.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have questions on the tone.
This is an interesting, funny, even alarming story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language is different in the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
This way.
This is a holy country.
Tom used to love bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We have everything.
How much is one beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find her?
This was at the top of the shop.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I'm gonna sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you messing with him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
- I'm calling.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
- Have a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people do you gather in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've got your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little damp.
