I want to contact all political commentators, politicians, participants in every show.
There is no need to demonize the people of the Habharov region.
This is where the hardworking and remarkable people live, mihail deghterev divided.
In an interview, Degtierev recalled that he was a member of LDPR and a member of Furgal and added that he wanted success in court, while the party and personally Vladimir Girinovski would be supported in court.

Semillars against the Prosecutor's Office: the cassation of former Deputy Mayor Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that the decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the two first instance refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April its cassation complaint was brought before the State Court.
The administrative court of Tartu returned the complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019 as its authorization was not within the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The Court ruled that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for the damage caused during criminal proceedings.
“These matters must be settled by the Prosecutor ' s Office and the Court of Justice”, explained earlier to the correspondent of the ERR press secretary of the Tartu Courts, Anette Creatsmann.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski regretted this decision in the district court, which did not change the judgment of the court of first instance on 5 February.
Now I have to say my word to the House.
According to the defence attorney Semilarski, the sworn lawyer Oliver Neaes, his client was unreasonably under suspicion for about two years in custody.
He now called on the prosecutor ' s office to reject false allegations and to repay him for his moral damage.
In October 2017, when Semilarski, along with others at that time Deputy Mayor Tartu Artem Sovorov, was detained for several crimes.
“Remember, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole of the Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local authorities, were selling.
These airtight public suspects accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have proved false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neaesa, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor ' s office should operate.
"The acknowledgement of receipts and sales has proved false, but it is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its decisions on Russia and Lithuania that, during the investigation, representatives of the State must be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before the trial.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Niès said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and recipient in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion in the reception are still being ascertained is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant”, the lawyer added.
As Rus.err.ee wrote, former Deputy Mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski would not be held responsible for the charge of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former officer is accused of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions of particularly large sizes.
According to the indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city administration meetings in making decisions related to Tartu companies, the owners or managers of which Semilarski had been actively involved at the private level at an extraordinary time.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests and therefore he had to refrain from taking part in the decision-making process.
Earlier, as Rus.err.ee wrote, the Prosecutor ' s Office had filed Semilar suspicions of receiving and violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions in particular large sizes.
This happened in October 2016 when he was arrested along with another deputy mayor, Artem Sovorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both Deputy Mayors.
After that, both officers resigned.
The Sovorov case was later brought before a court that fully justified the policy.
The trial of the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

How the decision by the CB to reduce the key rate affects the economy
We expect the Bank of Russia to again lower the key rate.
It dropped by another 0.25 per cent to 4.25 per cent of the annual formal historical minimum.
In view of the return of a short decline in the rate, as well as the tonnage of CB statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation can soon be halted.
"We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially given that the risks of inflation decline remain below 4 per cent in 2021," reported the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiulin.
They relate to a significant decrease in economic activity, the fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiulin, will take more than half a year.
She noted, however, that economic processes had been revived following the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic: energy consumption, consumer demand and investment, increased construction and release of consumer goods, slowed the annual rate of transport traffic reduction, production.
According to CB's detailed forecast, the decrease in the economy will be 4.5-5 per cent in 2020 (approximately 4-6 per cent) and the recovery rate in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5 per cent in 2022, 2.5-3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil price forecast to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB was expecting $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Russian Bank's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, according to economists from Russia and CIS "Renesans Capital" Sofia Donez and Andrei Melaštenko.
Yes, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced its key interest rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 per cent.
At the last meeting, in June, the CB immediately reduced it to one percentage point because of low inflation rates due to overloaded demand and the need to stimulate the slowed-down due to the pandemic and its economic constraints.
The chances of money-laundering are maintained (at the next meeting on 18 September and by the end of the year), but the border is already close, the main analyst, Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev, agreed.
The set of pro-inflation risks also indicates the proximity of a break in the reduction of the percentage policy - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to the prevention of the epidemic and faster (compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
The Bank of Russia will need more attention to the inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as the external volatility that has increased in the background of geopolitical conflicts, says Koshelev.
In other words, lowering the key rate will result in further lowering the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps by the mortgage, says the senior economist of the Bank's Analytical Management, Maxim Petronevic.
The adjustment of rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he said.
Consumer credit rates may fall by an additional 0.3-0.6 percentage point during the second half of the year, and mortgage rates may end in an annual range of 6.2-7 per cent, without excluding the economy of "BCS Prime Minister" Anton Pokatovic.
The average rate of contributions, he believed, would also fall - in the coming months they could drop to 4.2-4.5 per cent (now only above 4.5 per cent).
They may also drop to 4 per cent if the CB reduces the key rate in the autumn, it considers Pokatovic.
The centrist party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year

Question: Lithuania's leading Christian and Green Union has again led the rating of the parties
The Union of Christians and "greens" of Lithuania, the leader of the Seimas coalition, has led the rating of the parties.
This showed a survey carried out by the company of sociological research Villmorus even after the order of the Lietuvos rytas newspaper.
Following the victory in the 2016 parliamentary elections, "Christians" lost their first place and for a long time led the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of Nationality - Christian Democrats (conservators).
However, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, recently assessing the electoral opportunities of the parties, said that the Union of Christians and "greens" after the parliamentary elections this year would probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement led to the malnutrition of the conservators.
The last survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for Christians and 17.2 per cent would vote for conservators.
According to Director Vilmorus Vladas Haydis, the failure was a mistake, and still the perpetrators ceased to leave the conservators.

This policy was the first on the list of “Christians” and in the 2016 elections.
Thirdly, the Social Democratic Party is now ready to vote on 7.1 per cent of respondents.
For me, she suddenly lost 2 percent.
Fourth - Labour Party headed by Russian businessman Victor Savepski (6.2 per cent).
Other political organizations, judging by the question, have not yet been able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

The authorities of Sub-Moscow told us about the fate of closed mines
In Sub-Moscow, landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are modernized in modern musoroperipheral complexes.
But this option is not possible for each location, many of which have grown up with a flat housing.
After the polygon is closed, it rises to recultivation, the polygonal body is moved by soils, the exhaust system is mounted and the infiltrate is removed.
This allows the chemical processes to stop in the trash so that it does not burn, eradicate or poison soil and groundwater.
And then the ex-scarlet remains raised by a useless dog in its nest.
Why don't you make her something useful?
For example, in Russia, where the recycling of the Anna area has literally ended in the days, the authorities are considering making the option of making a mountain goat.
This site, which has operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so far that it has crossed the borders of the land under it.
It was therefore necessary to buy out neighbouring sites, de facto, which had long been tied up by the garbage.
"Sometimes it's going to happen, the police are going to get stronger, and we're going to think what we can do to get it to work.
It's a gornolithic resort," told the reporters of the Russian district of Nikolai Parfenov.
Two polygons will become renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo sites in the Lubercs and the Tymohovo district in the Bogorod district will become sites for the recovery of renewable energy from natural and biological gases.
A gas station will be launched in Torbeeva by the end of the year, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalities of heat, which will provide its own needs for the polygon - the heating of administrative and production facilities.
"Timocho" will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue as a musoroperipheral complex.
A museum may be set up in the Balashino area of Kucino, which was closed after the claims of the residents on the Straight Line with the President of the country.
“It was such an idea – to create a museum for the reculture of the sites of Podmoshkovya”, the Minister of the Environment and Environmental Management of Dmitry Kurakin told the Government.

Fourthly, there are no "Islamic" and "Regular" civilizations.
Some of them are believers, some of them are hypocrites, some of them are hypocrites.
The believer in the categories of civilization will not think.
It's the idea of a British agent of Toynby, who believes it's embarrassing to think so.
And as for him who believes, a place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray except to be removed from where he is asked to, and he is being driven away to a place other than that, and he prays.
He is the one who believes, and is not rebellious.
We're dolls, not rock.
