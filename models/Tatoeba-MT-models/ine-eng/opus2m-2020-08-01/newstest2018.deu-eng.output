Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A wrong place to meet today's young people.
A cave chapel where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small farmers manage the unique reason for farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.
It's nervous if land maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who had to get excited already knows this because the car-navi instead of an surrounding road showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are all different than current - but that is why very exclusive.
Especially when you compare it with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich Mercury distribution since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a girl's carpet that you don't recognize as such.
More detailed maps, called Urposition Sheets, were included in the large map for cities and municipalities.
These were created according to the Bavarian Measurement Management between 1810 and 1864 and originated the first Bayern measurement.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French military leader occupied Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical recording of Bayerns on order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801 finally withdrew: It was the present neighbors who created the idea of a surface-covered Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Office" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Management.
The Urposition Sheet for Munich comes from 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian National Library.
The comparison of early today is the most impressive example of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was granted 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as the Munich district.
Today subsendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Houses of Unsendlings focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you don't see anything as fields - at first glance: In the inn zoom there is a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered fluoride pieces from the so-called "absorption", from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots no longer show farmers there today - but small farmers of the plant "Land in the Sun".
A large green area is drawn north from undersending.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was actually still a desert in the 19th century and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the height "On the Winds" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with crazy ideas.
There were 1858/59 München districts "On the Auer Luften".
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of so-called errors.
He also prevented staff from resorting to violence against the insatiables," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Hidhausen Museum, who has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there was first room, and later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circuit assembly in Haar 1905.
There has been the Isar-Amper clinic of München-East since 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.
At the area of the former Auerstalt, young people are now meeting at the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
The TSV München East football stadium is located in the west, east of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural construction on the foundation of the Irenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II during bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as the "Main Square", which was called the "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change also led to World War II in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a group chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where this day the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn family line took place.
With the slide rule, the old Munich map can be compared to today's air image - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloring has issued a warning for colouring people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missouriians to pay particular attention to travel by the State and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racially based events have occurred in recent times throughout the country and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri that makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state's criminal prosecution authorities, which aim disproportionately at minorities, force the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They will be arrested for their skin color, beaten or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist acts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gas by the state during his trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recently published report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that black drivers in the state are kept 75 percent more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be willing to bring bail or let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, following the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which classified the state as regards the number of such violations in the 16th grade of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws, which the local criminal prosecution authorities were obliged to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, would contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent years interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Large-scale project is an elemental
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU agents Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the funeral of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU community met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwedemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and many young animals as well as accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwedenmann.
On the table of the holiday guests come only regionals.
Since he is also BLHV president of Fischerbach, he described the Videzaun project as "essential element".
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, much has to be done with the motor sense.
"We have to fight the conditions and the topography here," stressed Schwedenmann.
In 2003, he took over the parenting plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he did not conduct any bio-activity.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Videzaun project and is happy about the Leader Foundation".
At the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers had to be supported.
It is hoped that this could lead to the expansion of the areas for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations," stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were added to the programme.
The surface of the opening shall be 40 hectares, which shall not be opened until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half were funded over Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers stayed at 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the teeth," Schwedenmann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a good job without farmers and rural women".
Peter White also said: "Here are the best foods produced".
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Board (LPR) enables the State to promote pastures.
The goal is the revelation of the Black Forest.
It is a prerequisite for the existence of a support clause designated by the LPR.
Furthermore, the area to be decommissioned must not be manageable (dependence over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by deforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots that want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other – therefore the carefully staged storm Saddam Husseins on the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axis in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals to radically restrict legal immigration with the status of freedom.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have lit him if he had.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the meaning they were assigned when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Memorial, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta scoffed, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites some old immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigues, your poor, / your troubled masses that look forward to breathing freely, / the sad waste of your rich coasts."
There's never been a time when the "poor waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is actually a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by representing the female body of freedom in a well-used classical image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and an enchanting attack on American nativity.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a species of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not invited, but rather an early neoconservative that brought the American flame into the unnighted world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She's supposed to bring the fable of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The falcon is not supposed to light up the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh has hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great fantastic act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is in the real sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to recognize.
Her spells should not light up the way, but inflame the hatred that is her only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British team
Elid Doyle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the British team
The United Kingdom Light Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says that the 16-head Scottish contingent in the World Championship Framework will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "they develop something special in Scotland" and the UK's light athletics have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Light Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will join Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m route, while Elid Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain.
"Eilid is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Elid of course brought were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will take part in her fifth World Championship at the 400m Cups, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 shots are in the British team.
So far, Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The middle runner Muir is leading this way and has established five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that you should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot in the Lee McConnell team was.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but also in some cases in the medals and in the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor at the same time, but knowing that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb the podium.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home-world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from our being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot slow down the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He smiled at the criticism, I'm sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led like the sheep to the slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union complained to him this early this week.
The governor's staff decided the complaint as free, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very well prepared to use Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called an official forum and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the peitches online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And they are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Ms., was not full of hate, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the news release "The Post".
"I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are denied by some more than a so-called collective use and not as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees call "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "provocation".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than before, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical leads and burn or arrest demonstrators and bring to silence.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is complained about by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the board of supervisor of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the available port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers doubled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailers applied to his leadership.
And even then Washington had an anonymous troll.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that undermine Washington's decisions.
Requests that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overpowered his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring them to silence.
Freedom of speech, diversity of opinion and discourse are the basis for our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will hold the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led in the Archerfield Links last year to the end before he lost Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and serves as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he reached his fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he fixed this place.
He is a jealous accuser of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"That really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since she was taken out of the program the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories come back from last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I am happy about how far it has gone."
With the Trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmour and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £5 per car with one seat and £10 per car with two or more seats.

Less lung cancer caused by passive ulcers
In the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer as a result of passive smoking.
This results in a study by scientists at the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive practices per year," said Heiko Becher, head of study.
In comparison, he started his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive vomiting per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections turn out to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger Street are in full swing and "sometimes lie in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of household connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is much hidden in the background, which is not noted in the plans.
Transport, which is still hampering construction, is a major problem for the construction of the company Stumpp.
"The car driver's ignorance of red lights and abrasive lights is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road has been blocked and only the line buses have been entitled to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite exciting.
But luckily we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a herd.
She's only rarely using a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Panai Regentity in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potatoes - locally called "not" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cold tuber will be taken and swallowed with ferocious, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the leh floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing clothes with heavy water from the nearby soup.
An egg in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned a field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it can be dangerous to work late: Most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded after a controversial referendum in Indonesia in 1969, when only 1,026 elders should vote by public handling before the occupying forces.
An existing movement aimed at independence against the Dutch government quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as far away as it is possible. The trip consists of a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tiles and well-bleach roofs converted by rust into different yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, silent because journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan honored a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this dress," says Degei, pointing out to her lively, hand-woven turbane, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Panai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport lost 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated at $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military retains a stifling presence.
A 2005 New York Times survey reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated with no pleasure.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua descent in the 1970s were committed to genocide in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We Will Lose Everything" means in a report by the Archdiocese Brisbane of 2016, which contains reports on the atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal facilities and torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims, as events happen every week," says Andreas Harrison, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua's resources bring a flood of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warg Canteens sell roasted chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with strawberry juice.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Panai native who moved to Jayapura Province.
"It cost the indigenous Papua - the mother [the women] of Papua - their market."
During his 2014 election campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panai, on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua there has been little change, and today the natives feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, Panaii is only two months after Jokowi's dedication in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke a motorcycle through the darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn on their flashlights.
One of the soldiers attacked her and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers set fire to the group of the children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulian Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football site in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and led the waita dance - in the circle and in imitation of a bird song - from Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to slam stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, an internal radio command was sent to the soldiers: "If the masses withstand more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and asked the multitude to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said to TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overloaded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin was the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was there," said John, who, like many Indonesians, only bears one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesperson of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the following day 'filtered'.
For three weeks Jokowi in Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and pledged to address the historical maladies in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wirtano said in October 2016 he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to deal with historical human rights violations.
But the arguments started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that have to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke with TIME in Jakarta on June 5th and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all is legal," he said.
Viranto, who accused the UN of "crime against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been reported, including the Panai incident.
The families of the Panai victims took such claims with cruel disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Panai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at village residents in Pania's neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man into the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Enraged villagers protested before the company's local office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing fires.
But natives say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid there would be a rache," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and was a witness as the injured were delivered here quickly, according to the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on interested officers to be taken into account and to withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Panaii was always an unrester for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the native Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend Papua's rights by attacking sporadic attacks and executions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Panai have been arrested and randomly taken into custody in the last few years, under the pretext of "safety of national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua Panai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Anarotali is too expensive for natives.
Bread is just as wide as bread.
The people here build everything they eat: above all note and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can manage four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
You keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have arrived at Nabire Airport in large numbers since the opening of new flights.
The few jobs in the region tend to go to the better-trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to compete with its own companies.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai family council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain high on international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were rarely allowed to film.
According to Phelim China, the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election struggle were not realized to remove the reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's most restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panai shooting.
The same countries have historically seen the OPM support.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir showed back the group's objections and said in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence for human rights cases."
People on the spot want more foreign governments to know about this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and challenged him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Panai shootings," says Gobai, president of the Family Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a thief, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the Panai Shossop families carried out a final symbolic act of the Trotze: the body of a victim was buried on a site precisely against the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they will not let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fires capture the 'Torch' cloud crater from Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire was found in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents from the 337 meters high to flee 79-storey buildings.
It is the second fire that has been running through the high house for only two years, which is called the Torch Tower (Fakkel Tower) by chance.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we woke up at the fire alarm and when people were shouting.
We broke down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who mentioned his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai Civil Protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 p.m. local time (00:00 p.m. GMT) destroyed the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for the affected.
The event can repeat questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of highhouses around the world.
A survey by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage from the coating, the outer coating for decoration or insulation occurred.
In Britain, the police said they believed that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire, with about 80 people dying.
No Davis-Cup reform: Continue Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) was held with his great Davis Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup single was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
Although they are often very long but therefore also highly estimated five sets of classics remain the traditional competition.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our Member States have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
You will continue to work to improve the application.
Even after many objections, it was not until now that the proposal was put forward to bring the finals to a neutral position.
Newly from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: In this way the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round in the next year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers bring forbidden items to the plane, a survey will find out
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent were aware of or unconsciously prohibited items at the checkpoints of the US Transportation Security Administration via smuggled charges, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft, while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other items with sound.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had late discovered that they had been mistakenly travelling with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - performed by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers did not respect the rules.
Of the respondents who claimed that they had deliberately tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were Millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately closed to TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had significantly been subjected to safety checks by means of sounding, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had asked travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had been brought through the airport security and how many had done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that people who carry the most common smuggler - both knowledgeable and unscientific - through the safety of those who were the most frequent flyers.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what fluids they can take or how much of it.
It is therefore not surprising that the largest quantity of liquids seized by the TSA is prohibited.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could view books as smugglers.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Ten thousand Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousands Sassa Elon Musk is happy to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-distant number of sales increases and even more gigantic targets, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has betrayed for the first time another, less brilliant number in the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often made more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518.000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non-binding reservations.
In the event of cancellation, Tesla fully repays the 1000 Euros (in the United States $1,000 and in the United Kingdom £1,000) "Reservation payment".
At present 455,000 such non-binding reservations are presented, allowing muscle to be admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the head of Tesla does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 will be - all models combined - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is clearly there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today can count on delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its nail new, never in practice, production roads without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, then the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running out of it.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the withdrawal of Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was filed by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama's rules to reduce emissions of Smog-induced air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency showed itself to the needs of the state environmental authorities in relation to faster reactions than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint brought against his previous position in a federal court of appeal.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground-floor ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "intuming in local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump as State Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was for a long time a more reliable opponent of more stringent environmental protection regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved on to block or delay regulations that are opposed to the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal backlog for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Appeals Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration rule, which the oil and gas companies had undertaken to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday, Pruitt proposed that its return to ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then expected to be accused by groups of activists and others, and in agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who complained to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have."
However, the EP opinion stated that Pruitt would at one time use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on a sound policy and the best information available".
The Republicans at the Congress insist on a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved in the last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had complained to the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection were celebrating a surprising exchange of courses over Pruitt.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step by the air protection officer we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental polluters and their special interests".
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius-Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, it will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz show can be fascinated by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique village. "
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Letters: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Voggei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
The text of the certificate was based on the Tumlinger mountain, apart from the former parish church, also a royal court, to which the church or patronage rights belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, in addition to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still to be recognized today in the village image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the dominant settlement center of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 undermine these historical events.
The right of the patronage was created by the early Middle Ages own church law.
A Lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest continued to own this church and could also inherit this own church.
In this connection, it was the right to appoint a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three ages in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two fell apart on Christmas in 1673.
The newly created bells were released for the first time in 1692, but later in World War II was to be released in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were struck and the bell lines were stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796, French troops were stockpiled near the church.
They broke out the cabinet and church chairs and used them as fuel.
The rest of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirkhe was destroyed.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the church tower and the half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was interrupted.
Only the still existing tower tower remained a witness of the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter What are the "shipful Renters" as a successor of Dieter Dockhorn maintaining the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, 16 July, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite them to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the closing words.
The program begins at 4.30 p.m.
The meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.
To the sound of the serenade, a coup takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view of meadows to the forest", the eventers present the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers look forward to many supporters to receiving the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and hearing aiders.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to take care of their home, as confirmed by Serenade-Organiser Walter Martini.
The association wants to examine the approval of windmills
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The Boisheim Association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the creation of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim network.
She's been lawless.
The Association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim network, no wind power plants could have been approved, since at the time of fourths there was only one wind power concentration zone at the city border at Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone has an effect on the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
Such zones should prevent a "dissipation" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim network a few days earlier by changing the area use plan - but the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a mistake.
"By virtue of the lack of planning law, the consent granted is still to be withdrawn before and for this reason," said Christoph Erkens, president of Boisheim, "refuses".
Current state of things: The City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim network before the summer break; an approval of the district government is still in place.
Erkens: "In this case, the granting of an authorisation for the creation of wind power plants is legally excluded".
The circuit confirms the entrance of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been entered at the 4th Circle since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes her to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the termination of the procedure.
In view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the County did not wish to make a substantive statement on Thursday on the argument of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning on a site on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four 200 meters high windmills.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Foursen is directly involved, had concluded pakt contract with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large land.
With the creation of the four wind power plants, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households are to be covered - about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen and for participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crashing together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwalmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was mortally injured.
Two others were slightly injured.
The road remained closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich with her car in the accompanying drive with her 53-year-old mother was accompanying the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and merchants plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping mall in the city centre.
As the chairman of the Business Association, Christian König, announced, the "home shop" weekend should make customers aware of what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore planned to be a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic firms are expected to present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the downtown shops are to be invited to the Midnight Shop.
The action is not only aimed at the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertisements in the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action, says Christian King.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
In this way, the enterprise and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive Innstadt".
These include new offers such as the first "Activ-day" for the fountain festival as well as on the sold Sunday, discussions with all traders and hosts to move them into active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the cancellation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-assessed or re-assessed.
This includes students and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city when buying.
In the end, everyone had to contribute to the city's survival - up to rent, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It is true that by means of a network to overcome the lethargy that has partly spread, the king had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, told that on the third day of "home shop", the first five cities of Thuringia were involved.
In addition to Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherrode.
The day is to "advertise the value of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities", says Strek.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after an explosion at U.S. school
During construction there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them hard.
According to the firearm, on Wednesday (location time) there was another injured in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
First, a missing person was also killed.
In the case of the dead, it was the employees of the school.
As a result of an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stood up in the Minneaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after secure transcripts of telephone calls due to the payment of the border wall
Transscriptions of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January Trump called on a telephone with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had pushed the wall publicly. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and he swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
The transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an intense exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was "Laughter", "mimes" and "mimes" and that the existence on the trade that the Obama government had been mediated would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for all day."
Moore Ford Massacker: Activists perform racist Lynchat as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men drew up with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a needle race suit - took a long train on his cigarette and looked through the windshield.
Drinden swam the Insasses in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" the man whispered.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying broke the silence, when a young black man was stabbed by the driver's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just one episode.
But then when a snake is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all the people in the audience are very real.
Since 2005, citizens have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lit by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one's ever been accused of murder.
"It is really incomprehensible that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the post.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a lifelong citizen.
For him, the legacy serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A court doctor puts a bet on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although suspects have been free on foot for decades, citizens say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to give their vote in the summer in the pre-election struggle for the first time.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcolm was a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight below - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore didn't come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and the Moore's Ford Bridge approached, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," a FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, destroyed evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is making it even more impressive.
"It was a right-of-election massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has led the annual creation of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Its presentation is spectacular, exciting and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look, and it's harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch, because then we'll be confronted with his uglyness in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've done."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest black – were pushed into a room and listened as Green started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes Co-Director.
He's been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcolm, the horse shuddering and bothering him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n-- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona fires the fire.
There's a break.
And then every one of them will come out to laugh.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still staring.
"I just don't think that white people said a-- he."
"But," one of the other black performers shouted.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts into space, a feeling of friendship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in mourning clothes, stands over the bodies of the actors and runs Billie Holidays mourning Lobrede "Strong Fruit".
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers wipe out sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple are from Ithaca, New York, driven to see the performance, many only come down the street.
You've experienced almost eight hours of intense humidity in Georgia when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murder remains an anecdotes, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spreeful.
When the last notes of the song turn out, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children jump on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.
"They're not really dead," complains a little boy when he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks for the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchsei and wipe out their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his associates and then tears in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
On a table a white couple from Atlanta shouts about the layout with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What is really doing with me is letting me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps on his table, eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he started planning the performance next year.
"The message is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have suffered, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, whoever does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
"Goddess" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a blond-free stage in front of a giant six-piece ball.
The turntable (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shaky street corner as well as wallrest and gift buds in Berlin, a "plaste and elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Prior to this, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked in which the Rhine-Daughters pose as rock girls, or alternatively an Iseta.
Stable oil barrels remember Castorfs Leitmotiv - money, power and gear - that draws through his "ring" scene.
The three Rheintötters - songs by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess takes them to Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), destroys a body in Hollywood-Manier and gives the Krawallo-Clicke.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful festive garden surrounded by the Aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats victory peace.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who are modest and tend to bend their hands to the Merkel route, are stormyly celebrated.
There is a big coincidence for the festival orchestra, which is shown on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in lower leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team was eagerly expected.
If he had yet to have a valid pepper concert passed on in 2013, there were five years later great jubilees in which the single "Buh" calls went down.
The party leader Katharina Wagner must have been pleased about this.
"It is noted that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she had just said before the dpa performance.
Not only did the public make a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding of its way of thinking.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max Amount Works as Volunteer
They work in their volunteer year at the same time in several places.
Where is it?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture stock exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late volunteer.
How's it going?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, was successfully interrupted.
I recognized for myself that it was a lie for me and that I wanted to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, perhaps at the point of focus, is real.
And that's what it was?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my study in the winter semester as a socialist.
I'm going to study twice, probably do a social work training at the Herne Jugendamt, and study at Hamm University.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use while volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's probably always where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from the old house to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
With me, it was very different.
I was also part of the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really went.
Other than in the engineering studio?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people ahead of you, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a youth who has been taken out of the family, must always enter into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any concerns?
Quantity: I'm not the type.
It's an area that's a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce their interim dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 seats, the site was announced mainly by Director General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan of more than 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the quick step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its share last month in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it reached an increase of 1 per cent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement of the birth was given.
According to local reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan suffered this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Hereat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
An opinion by the Nato states that the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised bomb rate carried by persons".
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had committed this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly militant attack in the country, since the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that suicide victims in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their politics, and in particular in the name of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA decides to delay the smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to postpone the regulation of the Obama government, which obliges States to reduce the emissions of Smog-induced emissions, one day after 15 states complained to the Agency for the move.
The EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to proceed with the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", and said it demonstrated the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced the EPA's intention in June to measure the ozone requirements - which are to be measured in part of the country's pollutant emissions in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - in order to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most of the democratic states, together with the territory of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental challenges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda which, according to Trump, is intended to stifle economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the fall of the Democrats and nature protection groups, which are concerned about the effects of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing air, which contains ozone, can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community space will be reduced
At the end of the decision was clear: In the case of two votes, the municipality of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to establish a Community space in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the church community to have the area in the community, there is no longer any obstacle to planning for the project to be approved by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to oppose the community.
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a still 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality are committed to providing such a Community space not only as a meeting point for the residents of the senior right of residence but also openly into the community.
For example, the word from "strickcafe" made the round.
The decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past autumn will be welcomed by means of funding.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area, as noted by Mr Tjaden, would be eligible by 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision is designed to signal to the investor that there is no link between the legs in this regard, that it would be possible to establish that both sattel- - which is linked to the construction of the environment - as well as pull roof - which reduces the level of trust and makes the construction more economical.
Not necessarily, so not only does Wilfried Sohmer, but this addition.
If it helps, he'll happen to the board.
It is not so easy for the Community.
Daniela Calle refers to many of her own buildings, with which you can't get ahead so well, you're now denying yourself at the community room from the window, she says, "I'm having a hard time doing this."
Yvonne Staiger is certainly speaking out for the Community space - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy on assets or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not provide any subsidy, but gives a genuine, marketable counter-value, in the event of doubt, says the contrary.
The request for a decision to be split up in accordance with the rules of procedure shall be made by three advocates.
In this way, two opposites remain in the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up as follows: "If we take the decision this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Wheeler is pushed on the road
On the crossing of the road, an 82-year-old biker was recorded in Garath on Wednesday by a car and was seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the way on his bike on the Black Road from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road along the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver running in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langefield went on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He was in a car with a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was rushed to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ambulance.
FC Bayern München must renounce David Alba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without it: David Alabama must let the game go against Dortmund.
With personal care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the POK.
The staffing of the German football recordmaster Bayern Munich will be increasing at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund in front of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport).
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up the BVB in duel with David Alba.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six tests, Ancelotti has made responsible the physical state and the missing balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," Ancelotti said and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good lately."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official performance of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, expecting a "hard, intensive game".
The duel of both German football weights draws the fans into their band.
The party was sold out with 81,360 spectators, the Deutsche Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the Harz of Stars to Stars
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be created throughout the nation.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
A planet path exists in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" is against the need for information from many Harz visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to draw up road tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "good affordable installations in five to six places" in Oberharz.
Enquiry comes St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeit and Siberia.
The information on the tables is to be added on the Internet.
That is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Freedom of movement is also a criterion.
Later the star path train is to be extended around the train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," said the Association.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was brighter than another, although it was far away.
It will also tell you what star a selected star is in and when it's best to see.
The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is reported to be one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen clearly with only eyes.
Since 2003, there has been something similar to the planned constellation - planetenweg - the planetenweg on the initiative of the association of funding.
Starting at Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet trail leads with its poles up to the Hainberg and the Star Warte - as well as a "foreign" location in Diemarden (the same municipality) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the twin planet at the end point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters diameter, while the exactly 75 meters sun still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is good four kilometers.
While the light from the sun takes about eight hours to the Pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to shop with Pluto.
So walkers are faster than the light in the world.
The march to the next fast star would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the floor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Spring Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory, by unanimous decision on the former Four-Division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds-for pounds-list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posted for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egis noticed the climate that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of size".
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I'm up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down on light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," Garcia said and later said openly to fight with the network offering the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ..."
Garcia said he regarded Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko kept up with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought he saw the trimph champion from Riverside "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the moment built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I waited for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by tires
In the case of an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four persons were injured in part.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the market width was connected.
The Pkw slipped right into the woods where he crossed and then remained on the roof in the green stripe.
The four insatisfactions - two adults and two children - were partly severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked to the north for about an hour, then the traffic could be carried on the left lane at the accident site.
Fortunes Hoffmann: "Trier chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 the season attack against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defence formation will lead to points.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, and with the result, would not have been the two combatants at 2:2 against Braunsweig.
"That was too many two opponents, and we need to be more careful in the eye," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's opponent.
The three-chain chain is also to be further optimized in the Erz mountain.
And a door after a free break the fortunes don't want to catch any more.
"For the future it will be so that no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparing with the three-chain is better qualified than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in the eye," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build well in the three-chain at the halfway positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"It is a prerequisite, but that we are even better at harmonizing and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also rides to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak after an indecision from a failed start, you don't know.
The performance could be quite fine," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand there with four points on Sunday and can focus on the podium, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular seasonal set-up."
His coach didn't want to know anything about it.
"The start of the season is only after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak of an advantage over the eye, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be interrupted in advance because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from the eye might even be a bit fresher, as they did not have a difficult and complete game like Fortune against an uphill favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are right now," says the Internal Defender of Fortune.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a light favourite on Sunday to meet in the final (almost) stadium of Aue.
"That we remove them only because we have the claim to come under the first six is blood," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against the eye of nine games.
"There is no team in the second federal league that must be beaten from the front," explains Fortunes Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Institute of Forensics Medicine (Rätsmedicinalverket) began the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Emigrant Convention) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "maybe under 18 years of age".
The tests shall only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.
"We don't see any big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person was 18 years old or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet surveyed the results published in 581, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, where X-ray recordings of wise teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't do it as if we could," he said to the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general you can say that the risk of misjudged a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is barely under 18, then this is about 10 percent."
Full Plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well advanced.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton portion of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Light, construction director at the Department of Roads and Transport in the government presidency of Freiburg.
In April the works started simultaneously on all three bridges needed for repair between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is scheduled for October and it is easy to make sure that the timetable is respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a giant bowbridge made of concrete, which is decorated with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three construction works are now being thoroughly repaired.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 metres wide on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of heavy bridge cap.
This is a border attachment which is also used as an operating route.
In the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the walkway will run.
The particular thing is that it is part of the manufacturing process, a patent by Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The special feeling of fingertips has required the laying of wires through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to the many companies.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handbook about the project.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is arranged by a lamp.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher Locationseingang, the road in the area of the bridge is completely blocked at the height of the hotels "Tannhof" and "Seven Linden".
The cost of the three bridge refurbishments totals EUR 700,000.
The whole country is financed.
AFD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to go on a strike, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites the poster "big electoral uptake".
And well-known names - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the federal election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eiffel remains."
Originally, the city picnic under the motto "All at a table" was planned on the well, but is now taking place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture that comes in there.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forums A world and one of the major organizers, is very pleased to say: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and every amount of food, including a "urdish potato salad, which can also eat AfD without problem", says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, and it is also present at the train station, which is just a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AFD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported by the AfD Volcanoes, he has tried and received the award for such an event.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a discount because of the already built Laurentius skirmishes there were not enough parking spaces.
So the Rondell, Hampes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event at the round hall, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
The same thing is done: A band for entertainment is provided at the round hall at 20 o'clock, including the Rhineland-Palestinian president of Uwe Young.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to speak.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
Something more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the outboard have a longer breath, but there is also said to clean up shortly after 21 a.m.
The police can withdraw - no special incidents.
Posaune trifft trumpete
There is a rehearsing with the Wolfaunist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher Monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he holds a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or also "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German training with roots in blast music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloosaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach, with both of them as in a new wall, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the jazz award winner Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and the free play mix into a fascinating work of art.
This core part of the programme was launched only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately involved in the concert.
Christian Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Christian Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"If I ever bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what happens next?'
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally became bitter.
Despite all this, the brunette actor assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with every serious thing I've ever dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After their separation Christians admitted that they were bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So I've never been confused or impaired.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
She particularly liked it, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time when she preferred to dress like a drum: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bug.
I felt really attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of you!'
Especially to the public, they do not like to declare their love: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that upsets me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't have to justify myself before the whole public."
West Virginia Governor announces that he is changing the party
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a announcement with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I cannot help you any more if I am a democratic governor."
The announcement broke out in jubel.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes of the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday, saying: "The change of Government Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the least-legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is above and below without leadership and is unable to find a positive, certain message," said RNC President Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe commends "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world’s leader, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as a public apology from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be taken back to sport.
Russia's Lichthaltek chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Lichthaltik World Championships that the ban on his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress agreed to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found indications of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the time to re-use Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the light athletics world championships that start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re-setting.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Grief for Malin soldiers who have been defeated
At a mournful festival in the Nordic Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two were thinking of soldiers killed in Mali during a helicopter crash.
The ceremony took place in the capital on Thursday under high security measures.
For an unexplained reason, Minister of Defence Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She referred to the two deceased pilots as "the know-how of their trade".
"We reject the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their grief was transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday by a German death guard.
At noon, only the family members in the church were separated.
Then came the mournful celebration in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Federal Defence and politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the wounds.
Before the church Fritzlars and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas wall.
Minister of Defence of Leyen referred to the deceased soldiers as "highly decorated" and used experience.
The Staff Chief of Staff has built up the flight of the fighter Tiger in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, the commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also said: "If this occupation could not turn away the riot, then no one would have managed it".
There was no doubt in the UN mission in Mali that the minister of Leyen showed no: the use was dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the mourner's celebration, the pain was brought out of the dome.
When and where they were ordered, the German army did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a tomb next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be married to his wife after his death.
This was shared by the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish king's pair is accompanied in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already prepared a sarcophagus for both.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be unclear.
But he does not intend to be assisted in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a cure because he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe was enthroned in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he went to rest and also laid down the title "Princess".
As Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - not after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be final, be still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be employed in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the subject he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife’s sympathy with the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult position in his almost 50-year reign in Denmark.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swaying, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk drums instead of stick socks, citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and the people here had the call to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for surveillance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
It was just two mistakes!"
President-in-Office Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
President Stephan Weil (SPD) of the Netherlands is not willing to resign after the loss of the red-green majority of the government for a quick re-election of the country day.
Because on Friday, he spoke for the resolution of Parliament.
In the past, the surprising disappearance of a Greensman from his country-based group in Lower Saxony had shaken the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its short-voice majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Greens MEP Elke Tvesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
The head of the CDU Group Björn Thumler wants to recommend that his group include them.
In this way, CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Low Saxony Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new land day will be selected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green country government had to decide now whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is imperative that the landday decides its own resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Land Day will remove the Prime Minister's trust and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be legally examined clean," said Thumler.
"All questions will be discussed in silence when they are legally sound."
Thümler called Twestens a step "but something".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a supporter of Black Green.
The Greens called on the adjourned Members to return their country-wide mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her country-wide mandate, which she has received over the green country list, with immediate effect," said the presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner.
The group president of the Green Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twest extremely".
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD chancellor's candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Dutch Green Deputy Elke Twest as a traitor to the CDU.
"The behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters and voters, but also a betrayal of Red Greens," the Federal Chief of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country's day.
The Ostit Tvestens costs the majority of Red Greens in Lower Saxony.
The politician puts his personal interests in front of the good of the country "in their hurt vanity and in their hunger," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty plot and is trying to beat political capital out of it."
Mr Björn Thumler, Head of the CDU Group of Lower Saxony, wants to recommend that his deputies include every West in the CDU.
SPD's group leader Thomas Oppermann, on the Bundestag, announced that Twesten would fake the outcome of the 2013 elections with personal career memories.
At that time the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, the SPD and the green ones had a thin majority of a voice during the day.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing infected eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in the interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to see the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Libensmedimediawarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs in question.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all, what we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Now does Aldi take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator by the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really being realized?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has been switched off without delay and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the introduction of the concerns of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade also has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and health-free.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg, they are not transportable.
Unladen eggs may, however, be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not responsible.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, production companies are not directly liable.
Instead, they have to account for economic damage due to unlawful practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of competence?
It was precisely the official controls that covered the procedure.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the surrender to the public prosecutors in cases in which crimes may occur are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to be able to make an unmistakable statement.
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers and consumers are rightly impressed.
By means of the tightened means, manufacturers, traders and consumers are placed in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticide Fipronil in the treatment of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated without delay.
This has to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be clarified promptly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unimpeded expenditure of the European Football Associations will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will yet come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair-Play Rules, which were launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that the PSG must at one time prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG can safely unlock the money so that Neymar sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to counter legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations that had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration on the Club's debts to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP deployment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.
Although Platini has liked the presidency in Hungary in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, continues to fear excessive spending.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a break, it can distribute the amount for the settlement of the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of compensation for the next five years can be set at EUR 44.4 million in the annual final.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 was met by the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a 60 million euro penalty (then 82 million dollars) that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to 21 players for the 2014/15 season championship league instead of the other 25 normal players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to list their financial supervision by delaying their income from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered as legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments by the WM Organisation Committee 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find.
The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to comply with the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymars to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, marketing and knitted sales.
The association assumes that after the signature, sales will increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would harm the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a union, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, chocolate Frey has produced chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is ahead of a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
At the request of the news agency, Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small redboards packed to 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to make any statements about the costs.
Sectoral interiors estimate the order volume according to "North-West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect: For a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious job.
As many applicants are present at the new invitation to tender, Switzerland does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper, Chocolate Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has distributed chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebout had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Switzerland two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are decorated with candy from the Confectionery Sprüngli, in the Business Class Naschen Passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi von Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short track Swiss Schoggi distributes chocolate Frey, both in business and in the economy class.
Easy Athletics - Discus-Olympiasier Robert Harting achieves WM-Finale
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, was unsuccessful in the national WM resolution and could only watch the discussion competition from the Tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who spent 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nies
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80s, for the 90s-year-old Grunge era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch Comedy "The State" for MTV) and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
At the same time, as a cultural artifact, it is a parody and a body of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a Franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it included an original story for a talkative box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By shifting to the core of the Gag - middle-aged actors play cute children who will grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more on the principle of cane, including a riff on the stalker films of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Shakes the Wave").
At one point, one character stutters through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The dear Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a Roman author, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-bad plot that's included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the Franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillon's under-lipper of "singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knocker.
It is the moments of random madness that could warm this Franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I believe as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Late", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia: the revitalization of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its eastern-west Rinkampf iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director suggests being a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-satisfied Gregor and an idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on television, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the reality of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who wears a reagan mask - that it often plays as one.
At six long episodes, it moves, and the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited for a shorter time, could better deliver his Agitprop satires, as Gregor and Iosef are constantly visiting the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a pile of hamburger.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a settlement.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with yours.
Fighting drug mafia in the country
The police were defeated by the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
In this case, 15 accused persons between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, officials provided larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.
Against the two suspects, there were German arrest warrants.
Both are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of 300 police officers were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious rape, attempted murder, robbery and repression.
Since the summer of 2016, the state prosecutor has established constants against organised drug trafficking in the southern German area.
There was a direct exchange between the state prosecutors in Constantz and Palermo, and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the major effort was also accompanied by four Palermo officials on Wednesday.
In particular, Italian nationals were closely linked to the Italian Mafia.
Another event on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired early in the morning in a guesthouse, was to go to the account of the band.
How to deal with large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign registry in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious decisions in the case of asylum procedures.
The Commissioner for the Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Way, has noted a media report on major gaps in the foreign central register.
Lacks in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious decisions" in the case of asylum procedures and removals, warned in an analysis presented by the "South German newspaper".
According to the figures, ten million people with foreign nationality are listed, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data have not been sufficiently processed, the data quality has not been good in parts so far.
In some cases data were found from 1921, "from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register."
"Failure data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
In the statistics on persons on departures, there are also EU citizens who should not even leave.
However, such misappropriation led to "a distorted debate on the handling of exit obligations", says the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy when they are taken from there.
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore says that BAMF has been conducting such procedures "for families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, it has been virtually no longer possible, thus referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, it is the responsibility of EU Member States to reach it first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country may send him back to the country of arrival.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity of fostering families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has provided guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The national spokesperson for the Left Group on the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Familys with children are threatened by the lack of human rights conditions in the Italian asylum system and a danger to children's well-being".
Second best results
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach had already made the blood donation service available to other people.
At least twelve of the citizens who were awarded a prize on Friday.
All ahead Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 litres of blood with his present 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipality, the municipality appreciates the repeated willingness to donate blood.
"It's great how our body is designed for this, and we pay the donors respect that makes their blood available to strangers, even useless," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained the circuit manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canteens are placed in their parts.
That way, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisonbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"In this year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK-Krijsbeitschaftsbeitschaft.
Apparently, the change to the theater had led to higher attendances a few years ago.
Earlier, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations.
Half so many booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times every 500 millilitres of her life span.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowing down speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "threshold" when it maintains the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) political decision-makers agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall.
But she pointed out that in the coming years, interest rates would be needed to raise Brexit's inflation and she said that credit costs might have to increase more than expected on the financial markets.
Members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide more than 15 billion pounds in this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to weigh on consumption."
At the rate of interest, she reiterated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be necessary to mitigate inflation and a "something greater" than expected markets.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "restricted".
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next year as corrected below are compared to the 1,9 % and 1,7 % projected in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The fund fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision will not change after the latest disappointing growth rates have dampened the growing expectations for interest increases and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the bank towards the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report has little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the acceleration will get even worse before it becomes better.
She added that in the next few years, monetary policy could not "prevent" the break in income, but she added that the pay would be "clearly" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak foundation, which will compensate some of the lower consumer expenditure.
The decision will come one year after the interest rate decline to 0.25% in last August following the shocking EU vote that led to the fall in the fund.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the demand for interest rate increases increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-duty households, with three political decision-makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2,9 % last month to 2,6 % in June, although the bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its target of 2 % was to "apply" to the weak fund.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive, as creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks especially good for those who run out of existing deals and close new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe HIV drugs for 10,000 people
From September, patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England reported that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS-Chief Simon Stevens as "an important new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this "a decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be able to register people, and further clinics will be followed in October before it is introduced in April 2018 throughout England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in people at risk of infection.
PreEP before sex means that there are just enough medicines in a person’s body to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Among those involved in treatment are male or female, transsexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor may also sign up for participation in their local sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study should assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used, recorded and implemented to a large extent.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the continued progress of more than three decades in addressing one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people who are in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left.
Now that PreEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of Shadows, said: "The start of the pre-EP process has been welcomed and overwhelmed by the government after months of delays and slow implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt will bring us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to take a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society.'
The great life: Between the shot and the clever designer tricks these little Earls Court apartment have turned into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high decks.
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet flat has been completely overcrowded.
Originally, a one-room property with a locked layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add staurum and an intermediate shoe to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi’s architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The roof was not large enough to place two rooms together, so that the architectural challenge was to create a gap in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together without having to build.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.
For the intermediate shot, a classic copper light window of retrovius overlooks the glamorous residential area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance mirrored units provide space for all beads and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Coupling kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the reinforced, supplied MDF door.
"It's balanced, so when you lift the door, it's very easy to bend."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate maker will enter and a calculation will be carried out based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the ground surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and help you to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something completely amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a dispute over one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation took place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and about one-third of Paul.
A legal act says that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed hearings last Friday.
The brothers are also fighting to control the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claimed, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul proposes to manage some holdings incompetence.
In an early affidavit that Colin submitted, he says he hopes to join the dispute.
"My Italian heritage presupposes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers' offices held on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who worked milkbars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the first Jeanslade of the family.
Colin says he started there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, and Colin claims that Mark was paid $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin stayed very back, although he was a former member of the AFL board and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to report me and draw our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In a letter to the court in mid-2016, Colin wrote that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be settled in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the head on a more balanced course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawson:
"As John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the President's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to beat Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship to television is long enough - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When the candidate Trump was upset by an accident report, it was productive to show him that he had received a fair report from places to be convinced," said former electoral councillor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant price of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about - that Trump's Tweets had even more toy without their intervention.
We'll probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have been able to keep him away from him for a while, then their efforts have been rewarded.
But nobody has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a white house that consists of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - completely occupied with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants to provide the President with suspicious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially such with damaging leaks, and that he can figure out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone was reluctant to give the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet-Provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Shikans or that he had not offered any concrete evidence or that in the past he had made false representations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Renice Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper clip that receives the Trump".
How'd that fit?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a preebus manager, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Mostly wanted criminals receive Europol's mail
Since the address is unknown, the people will pray and hope for it.
This summer, the police across Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted perpetrators are not known naturally, the population is expected to receive and pray.
Europol reported on Friday from the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar from winter.
The experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, it has been called Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 the website www.eumostanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Thirty-six of the online searches have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to indications after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionaires series'
Some of the most prosperous houseowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers on foot of war who have negotiated a tomb pulled from the community to return a field to their homes.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the "Millionary Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they had been thrown out in May, but without being frightened by a tomb dug by the Council to prevent their income.
The tactical group found a gap in the defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have challenged the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They went there on Monday after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement it because it was useless when dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, moved on and are back now.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal taxes if the Council can't even stop it."
A householder who didn't want to be mentioned said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plowed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area."
A spokesperson for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the ground outside the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police. We take the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move as quickly as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
The former Birkenhof hotel will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house before the doors of Freudenstadts is being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente company mbH as at 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues were also lost by the short tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who arrived in the rural district, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a meeting place, which provided for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipality at the time.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel's location and spoke of a growing interest in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Birkenhof Hotel at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star Plus category house named Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the city of Freudenstadt.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Birkenhof Hotel has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are being carried out.
The floors were cut out, roofs were partially demolished, old bathtubs away from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is a single building.
There's still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large showerables, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything is to be "beautiful citizens" later, as Thomas Schererer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
You don't want to be positioned on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a elevated central level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to get up wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidayers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talking to OB Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause he has already led, says Scherer.
The city's performances are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
According to the amount of investment asked, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under a million euros, he's counting.
External installations are also brought to the frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an indoor courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia-Affair: U.S. Special Agent sets up Grand Jury
Special mediator Robert Mueller is expected to use a so-called Grand Jury after a report in Russia's affairs about US President Donald Trump.
In recent weeks, the board has been working on the work, and the Wall Street Journal has been calling on people who are familiar with the matter.
The paper assessed the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first submissions of the Board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of being involved in the presidential election fight 2016.
Mueller is investigating whether there was a deal between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is to include several men who acted as advisor to the Republican in the election.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the lupe.
"Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Mediator Trump had personally stepped into the centre and examined the proposal whether the President might have impeded justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide whether to bring charges in possible cases.
The Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to as prosecutions.
They are usually activated when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board may also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite persons for admission under oath.
According to the broadcaster CNN, pre-charges have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report invited the parties to the meeting to make a statement.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then-elector Paul Manafort were in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday night on the US TV that the deployment shows that Mueller is not afraid of his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution.
However, the establishment of a new phase in the investigations was a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia's affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to "well feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that have accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he would not be identified against the president.
There was no reason to believe that something had changed, it was further stated in the statement.
But Mueller was only used after Trump camey was fired.
As a result of this draft, allegations against Trump have been made, and he has wanted to prevent justice.
Comey said in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure from the investigation.
After representing US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and his employees.
The resolved speculations about whether Trump wants to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special mediator, such as in the Watergate affair with President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be theoretically fired at the President's demands by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of republican and democratic senators presented drafts of legislation that would prevent the special mediator from being released as easily as possible.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in the Antarctica
In the Western Arctic, a giant iceberg has dissolved from the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
Over a billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers of colossus is now driving north and will probably take two or three years until it melts.
It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
As far as climate change has played a role in the end of the iceberg, it is unclear according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of icebergs in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be associated with global warming.
The colossus now broken was still part of the Larsen-C-Shelfeis.
Chelsea swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
So it keeps growing into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Shelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
In the north of this skeletal phase, the balance of growth and interruptions was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete shriek is falling down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some indication that the Larsen-C-Shelfei is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
Furthermore, the ice plate is under tension and can fall if a piece breaks down at a key point.
Melting Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as it swims on the water and melts as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish leads the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, however only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Shelfei is the fourth largest shelf of the Antarctica.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly there.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he confirmed.
Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Shelfei would grow again or perhaps fall back in the long term, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not bring the collapse of this giant iceberg into climate change, many of the Arctic peninsula's icebergs have collapsed in the past decades.
This long level of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Arctic peninsula's ice area has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has been warmed up by about three degrees over the past 50 years and is thus among the areas where the temperature is rising as fast as possible.
CDU wants home fare for staff
Because it is increasingly difficult to occupy places that are becoming available, the CDU calls to leave the employer's association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Krestag 41 has won new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teachings of the circle are apparently very desirable.
Around 620 applications were to be made for the seats to be granted this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.
These include doctors and engineers, as well as general administration.
The CDU will now take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and face the lack of expertise in the administration.
The administration shall, at the request of the parties, develop "a concept of staff gain and development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals, but to address the applicant's shortage in the future.
The overall concept should guide itself inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-country nationals and include training offensives, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
This is a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is from a regular "competition of public employers".
In addition, a large number of staff are excluded from the service on condition of sickness or old age.
So the maximum time to act so that no more places remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, the Group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He had recently taken care of a Faustdic surprise in the Kreistag when he publicly questioned the staff costs and surprised the other parties.
Peoples want to have all the possibilities to be checked to make it possible to get out of the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not arrive here in the short term to find a satisfactory solution, the circuit management should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - a home tariff," peoples say.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for tariff support for the public service.
The fees are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented to years of work.
However, the tasks of the circle have increased over the past few years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, where employees were taking care of the provisions of the new Prostitutional Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Land Council Thomas Henle and County Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy warned NGOs that they should not continue to use boats for migrants in the Mediterranean if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to make any detailed objections to the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"It is for us and the salvation of human life remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only judge all the charges that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been watching the boat of 'Youth Retette', the young woman, since October.
It is suspected that its crew will be carrying hose-boat migrants on board, which will be delivered directly to them by human dealers, and that smugglers will be able to leave so that ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast, according to the State Prosecutor's Act, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of monitoring the authorities of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue efforts in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Juventa must have an Italian police officer on board who is overseeing their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have so far declared themselves ready to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Active Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential changes or obstacles" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy had declined significantly over the past few weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weiler biker, the "Berliner Outer Posts" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There were views, partly on towers, from which you could look far across the forest and the pre-eminent levels.
In the meantime, there were ever more and more increases for those who had won long trials.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Salin and the People's Party Wurstmarkt.
Again, the view point of view was selected at the point of view, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many altitudes were said again.
The caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and caves brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe in the sun in the open air.
New town was also sent.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4,500 meters high, the group had known the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural -.
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of pushing through wind and weather over the stadium terraces?
The fact is: E-Sport has long been a serious industry, has become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gagens.
This has also been recognised by the first federal organisations that are increasingly engaged in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and lastly the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professions for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire a whole new target group for the VfB," says the Board of Directors Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure "that there are still some associations on this train."
The next weekend, the FIFA Football World Association in London organized the first "Interactive Club World Cup", where the gamers of different clubs compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Weder Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds in particular, that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The unions tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports under contract, you could be online more often on these markets than sending the federal league to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation are challenged on a competitive level.
Longer, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professions competed.
And in the Asian games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is this a good sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse has also long wondered about the question.
For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also on their body and pay attention to food.
"The fat player is a good player."
Froböse, however, also sees problems: "Dipping will become more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientists are positive for the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international road, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of the company advice Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.
In 2016, EUR 50 million was implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years the turnover will be at 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league, this is not the case.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", the Deloitte advisors write.
Many countries are still on the international scene.
Large markets are Asia and the USA where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport Wettans Provider Unikrn.
There are also some things that happen in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching course, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, football associations are currently required to set up an e-sport department, according to Dutt.
"In the European comparison, Germany goes back," explains VfB's Board of Directors Rötgermann.
Only falling into nostalgia and explaining the old times is not enough today.
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time setting up the company in the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," Dutt says.
"There's no way to tell you that only with football will everything remain as it always was."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
From the scandal about poison-damaged eggs, almost all federal countries are now affected.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord responded and took all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken into the regulars, which are proven not to contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemns because of the texts that Conrad Roy pushes into suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and have been put to trial for five years.
Carter was sentenced in June because of Conrad Roy's fatal murder, which took life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unhappy.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the call.
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that she and Mr. Roy had suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and with eyes pointing down when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible circumstance that she totally regretted".
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant influence on her actions".
A state attorney read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day on which I do not regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will bear with us forever," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "traced" by the discovery that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be a aunt to his children.
"No longer having this only person with whom I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy died of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hand yourself up, jump from a building, warm yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Richter Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and arranged that she should benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter were Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to 2007 for murdering her British companion in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michael Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimich: Learning from the new mini-lahm of the FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimich was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain is not an accident.
The FC Bayern will bring the confed-Cup winner a great season - Extra-Motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something else was there in his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimich immediately saw, even though the extra dress was very, very small.
But far away and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philip Lahm nor any Manuel Newer to see, he was holding on to his arm the bond assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the confed-Cup winner later, after his first use as a Bavarian captain.
Well, the object could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also show Kimich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was selected in the C-Elf from the profession of youth players, debuters and just from the holiday as a game leader.
Sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep at Laune.
So whoever has been chosen to join the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lahm.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on her arm did the rest of it.
And at all times Kimmich acted in this initial formation as the one who can best handle the rudder.
He gave instructions, tried to link the unplayed troops.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal in order to overcome his lack of fitness (he barely hit); Renato Sanches in order to get out of hell to access the services of the Asian travel (he hit only conditioned); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle in order not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikot.
That's a good thing.
In addition to Kimmich, Rudy stood up in front of the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The nominally occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and also tried columns successfully in the construction of the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy said that the result "was not as we hoped".
But he also showed proper performance at debut.
Game movement, tempo change: "For this style I was also picked up".
As unusual as this Bayern world is still for the new arrivals, you saw the party.
Rudy, for example, did not have one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimich took a few quick statements in the back of his new partner.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria, you just have to win every game."
Still, he doesn't have to bring the new one any more.
Alaba Motivated by ÖFB Women
David Albaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has just logged in on Twitter and wished the ÖFB lady everything good.
The Bavarian Legionary is almost a clubmate of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fevertly with our Lady.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational syringe.
The famous Bavarian shower might also need our ladies.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palestinian Minister: Economy Praises Knowings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Evelyn Lemke (Green), was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate, was often inconceivable.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T-V's request for a change in economic policy - at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, president of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing is taking over the desires of the economy that Lemke has blocked everything".
The biggest turning point is Natus in the infrastructure policy: The Lücklock of Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes that by 2021 it will have to stand up for the right of construction.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the Western Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to take up the route in December 2020, says Minister of State Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a way to support regional but international competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims, as Wissing urges, to place a Rhineland-Palatinate label on wine to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been depleting for ten years.
Furthermore, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Handicraft Chamber Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainers, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of EUR 1000 is provided for the existing Master's degree and EUR 2500 if graduates become independent within ten years of the Master's training.
However, the list of homework for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts are quickly created, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief businessman of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up knowledge in the country's operations, until now 29 people are occupied.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
Christian Baldauf's CDU Group Visa refers to the calculations of the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the acquisition of roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country as it wants to address the lack of expertise in the region.
In addition, the former broadband expansion in the country is encouraging.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with Note 3.4.
They complain about stacking internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervision board of the Pro Wind wind company.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months, because of disagreements, it already cleared the field again.
Audi to change 850,000 Diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi announced, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions" and therefore referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or restrict the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as revocation.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the stick oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install installations to neutralise the exhaust emissions emitted by vehicles also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of vehicles which could regulate the use of so-called off-duty devices to comply with the rules when a car was tested, but are falling back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of vans, others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month the former leader of thermodynamics was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in cars, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with emissions in Europe, and an application focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could have a heavy burden on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the river on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors too, on Saturday morning, a river runs through Munich, which has a special message.
If it goes back to Isar on Saturday, it will see a great river between the cliffs and the riverbanks.
And that's not the usual river, with Isar tourists.
It's not like the farmer wants to clear up.
On the river you can see a great info-transparency.
It shows a Müllberg.
The opening of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ...", the understanding for the Isar is to be reinforced as a protective wild river.
Last summer, the river was flowing over the Isar, and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmental awareness.
Mordillaless knuckle noses and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon characters, the knotnases of his figures are his trademarks.
Also with 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he, among other things, beat himself as a sign of luck cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60s of the break: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was always inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are immersed in drawings with the ship Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own statements, he is still on the sign, working almost ten hours daily.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, pets and watches his playful figures continue to find plenty of distribution worldwide.
For six years he's also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand footman as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which will come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The scroll is not written by him.
That is why he is more focused on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without words.
lavender from the Provence of Climate Change threatened
He has become a symbol of the Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is shrinking due to the conditions to be remembered and the insects that carry the diseases, which prepare scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions to major headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life span of Lavendel.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacterial that transmits zigade, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And it's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts visitors, it is also very much asked for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant holes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weak.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions to be considered include a better distribution of water and the slowing down of evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of water and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringia Rhone celebrates its 1200-year-old existence today.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Kremlin, penthouses, dealers, vagants or a land-use camp are to be experienced in the city.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce meet normally on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and persistent drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two top-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, to have perceptions and feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government or cartel's payroll, a catalogue of criminals who put Mexico's chaos at risk.
There is no peace break from the violence, and as the bodies rise throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her publisher and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs.
His lack will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "justice" depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamah.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their alpine dreams, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special tribunal was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murders of journalists are rarely brought to trial.
At Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"If we don't know why, we're all suspicious."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The guard drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
They tend to fly freely to Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing as quiet as Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
There is nothing to suggest that someone or several people will be shot on the street every day in Sinaloa or that the cemetery is full of destroyed, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are bigger than many homes for the living.
For a minute forget that there is a state of "ruhe" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the danger of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members purchased every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to Zeitungskysky.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without hitting on the noise problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper earned a call for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard - hit studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Price" for her report in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug dealing in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompevinto TV.
"You have to take over the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why didn't you tell me what happened?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird that could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and tips, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine of his destruction?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how they could do their work best and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you work with their wives, their children, their clean business, their secret start-up and land routes," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-esteem and self-esteem.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The problem is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucid smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce staff met for security training, there were suddenly no phones allowed. Days earlier it was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen who themselves referred to the Governor as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state spending that focused on the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this site, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was killed by a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"In the past, we had already known what happened," said Villareal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body condition.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The office of Valdez was converted into the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murder of journalists because the employees became something they had never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist at the State Prosecutor's Office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials said based on DNA tests that it was his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on roads and buildings in organised protests.
On this day, Director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they had told the truth.
She has since prayed that she be re-distributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organized crime, involved government officials and an equal society were "environmental".
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who were involved in organized crime under a roof.
The media watch group "Article 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut your mouth," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murder has a horrendous effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note allegedly signed by Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphone were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close the El Norte newspaper in the northern state of Chihuahua following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a lead article on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz, together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
About midnight the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizens' ladder before the office and drank beer when all their phones started to be summarised.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
They published the news from the board corner on the Riodoce website via Mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were shooting in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who kept the watch to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to report to the street."
Dinosaur’s tanning used to prevent his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, even if it's scary.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner were received so well that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his dirty skin was of red brown - and they said she had had something of a "an restless past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best-maintained dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well received condition has a surprising reputation for researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured plant fiber is the best-maintained fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, grub.
He encountered something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock in the square, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earthenware.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink with your eyes, you might almost think it's asleep," said chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant fiber, although covered with a weapon and similar to a walking panzer, was probably threatened by meat-flavoring dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as counter-review, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed them to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made battle lines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully discover it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shells and weapons over his body.
They discovered the countershadowing, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although contrasting is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is far above that of today's living animals.
It should be noted that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-flavouring dinosaurs that the evolution favored the distortion of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use countershatting - think of rehe, zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, which indicates that this nodosaurier was a real struggle to survive.
"The strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal’s life, including its preserved contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.
Back then, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further into the country than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved foamy skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Creed.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it. If you only have a little difference with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's asleep."
The season was a time, as huge theropods, meat-flavouring dinosaurs standing on two legs that penetrated the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyronosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was mummified after death in the sea and in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, rubb.
According to the museum, it is the best-maintained dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It consisted of two 20-inch-long tips that were rooted from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the parked plant fiber was swimming through western Canada until an overflowing river flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater supply of the dinosaur preserved its equipment in exquisite detail.
The decorated remains of this special specimen are so well received that the others still cover half-carcases along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the Lotto.
The more I see it, the more it gets confused.
Stained remains of the skin still cover the slender panzer plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are sprayed up.
I can count the scales on his chair.
In the weather: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A8: Button 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass car.
There are numerous injured, km-long staus and gaff.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass car accident.
According to the police, at 5:00 p.m., almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, were intertwined between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a weaver.
The exact number of victims did not provide any information at first.
It's about slight to moderate injuries, said one police spokesman.
A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the crash site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of traffic, Munich was about ten kilometers long.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive obstacles on the road - through numerous strikes.
The firearm noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers who now have sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car driver.
A rescue screwdriver was on his way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tested "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: nothing evening is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and you just have a great idea.
And then: puffff.
Comes the creator and awakens an unscathed or shakes the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Control of the road map.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unmanned road map control.
You just confirm by phone that you take your seat and then answer the driver's card.
Currently a test operation is running on two routes.
"If the offer comes up, we expand it.
It will probably then be available on many further routes in Germany at the beginning of the year," said one railway speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket rating without any creator.
However, in order to benefit from them, some requirements need to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers are doing anyway.
It must also be via the app of the train that the DB Navigator has bought, which is also the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get up in the train, you open your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customers will then have an electronic evaluation button.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train driver comes to place Y at the checkpoint, he knows that there is a passenger with an already rated online ticket.
So you can go to sleep, you can go to work, you can go to sleep.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to benefit the passengers again.
"If you would like to travel by train with our train crew, please check in with the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal", says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Remote Transport.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs".
In addition to delays and missed trains, those who often drive the train know that driving card checks are one of the biggest problems.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of your fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to review online tickets.
Either the credit card or the staff card is missing or another document you have to present.
The consequences are endless discussions between train crews and passengers, which leads to too bad mood in the department or big room and delays in controlling their own ticket and takes time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this also applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food.
Other train numbers on the same track are not yet off.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis born on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She jumped over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with @TheePharoah has been constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was dying of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She left her phone to return later on the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father who wore a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belligerent dog.
In another video, she said, another cop took his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and we can typically call it."
At this point, I felt a firefight.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return trip and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and of loss, of strength and of resistance that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, drove to Ferguson, they discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them," Ferrell later said.
"What has happened today is one of the highlights of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised there.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience any exaggerating racism, she's no different than the next black woman's child.
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florida Road, a place opposite the police station that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accused of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to be adopted.
"My activism has completely changed since 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
A week later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-director.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson had not focused their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death rowing.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us, we speak," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me how these people are represented, because that's how I'll be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not about a Messiah leader, but about a community that gathers," Folayan said - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability to this work and to the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black women in the wider Black-Lives-Mother movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, had marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identified themselves as a villain.
"Black, dark women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and that is why we constantly fight on different fronts.
Black, dark women have to carry the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it is said that "this is not an affirmative type of action", when ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who blew up this energy," she said.
"It is not a coincidence, although she was at the front because in a life on these crossings as a black, thin woman is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on bail for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the region, which it calls her home: "A Chaos".
Yet she clings to a song and feels obliged to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Dream" to "Size Wagon": TV readers discuss bit-gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre in the southern pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation 2009.
Cold leaves the subject barely one.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While they say one to the Bit Gallery: "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), they come from the other side: "Do not need a human" (Siggie Betten) or simply: "Size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition: The gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Rooms: "We've been shopping in the farm market for almost a week for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women, always very much.
We also discovered the Metzrei for us.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the building of the gallery.
There is this in other cities too.
In particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers sit in a market hall in the gallery, they reach the height of the rent.
It should not be too low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous.
There's enough of this in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some months and years ago.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we keep at least the market mall.
Because the product offered there is always fresh, most of it is directly offered by the producer and is above all priced.
As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are rented by larger companies only because the rentals there are often not portable for an individual dealer.
Unfortunately, there's almost no special business anymore and what's left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farm market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time if the Bit Gallery comes sometime.
Or is it already possible to sell all the bit-galeries from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my view, it would have been better to promote the right agricultural market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall there is no place for the crazy many - as I find it - useless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost unmarked - hanging on cables from the roof.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst sentenced a 35-year prison sentence after making secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Coming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfraud and dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three more days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has a sharp, although some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - created for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly since her puberty about identifying as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Because of the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a corny, black-white selfie, in which the manning was apparently not even sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blown wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 'Stranger Visions' project.
In it the artist produced portraits of aliens from forensic artifacts such as cigarettes and rubber, by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press release of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museums became uneven letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Supressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which envisioned a future in which President Chelsea's judgement would be transformed and they would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, the fact that Obama was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now some depth and strength in opening the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waged a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, two-way ways to further extinguish the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the odd timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her superscription (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic division, whose basis has been sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in lead.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take is that our genomics do not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a free phone in her hand from the U.S. disciplinary barracks like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it says.
"So never keep your mouth shut."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets Philadelphia.
"I'm still getting whole-haired when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was previewed in the comic book - but if she should, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, which combine like hordes of Protestants.
It was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic hippo groups were written with lead.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a lot of people," Dewey-Hagborg said from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
A nationwide manhunt is in progress for a professor at the Northwest University and an employee at the University of Oxford who is being sought out as a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the acts of Cook County Court.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several strikes.
A Community Warning System published by the Chicago Police Office said that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives were investigating the strike as murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now allowed and was excluded from joining the campus of the Northwest University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasure Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are willing to help US intelligence authorities in every way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to submit to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthened," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a terrible tip, who said that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the event took place on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are investigating a multitude of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA flight plan in the near future" - Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping.
The WADA driving plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's driving plan to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the reintroduction of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to stately supported doping in the Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-dipping system has made an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
At the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past to Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the Doping scandal by WADA from conducting doping checks in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKKD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi sells no eggs first
This was shared by the company groups.
This is a purely precautionary measure, which could no longer be affected by health problems, it was stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven negatively tested for fipronil-containing anti-inflammatory agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your employee at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Responses were often vague, less helpful or - even worse - misleading.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers don't trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She's been calling people from the outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, contact special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to deal with the C-Suite leadership forces and directly turn to the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the pursuit of your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Erret said that they had a better understanding of what your employees thought and felt in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hot card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which drivers have low consent results - so that you can dig, why.
Companies come to realize that you must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber that has been developed in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment, punishing those who have spoken.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Converter, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit.
Converter has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Converter lets companies send tailored "pull-" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the hot cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Business Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and manager of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Converter for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a startling and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good way to track down the complaints of employees.
Well, since the company is using Converter, problems previously identified and addressed by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this comprehensive 360-degree view in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the bookkeeping company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their senses", that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Converter offer your software as a service, and they charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, with the total capital raised to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November from Besemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complexity of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they have ever expected.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high fees and interesting projects are only investments.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong to them, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more obliged to make this company succeed," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glent.
Investors achieve income when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and engaged.
When the Analytics tools promise third parties to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement by the experts of the workplace culture is important.
However, the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can expect a change on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company rely too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of that?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, as he said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication and to add communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bond of workers in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the brown
It goes to 23 hours as a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6:30 p.m. the next morning.
"This is a real tree mill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday to Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the end of Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should begin at 19:15 in order to correct the player's already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time while Moras performed practical exercises in Westwood during six times.
They will be held during August 18 exercises. 20 before the start of formal preparations for their attack against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA's regime change, even if they added another point to the player's busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick around, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over, which, in view of the clear guidelines of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been designed with football, which is a protective network behind a torpfoste, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We'll put our security in place," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not much to think that people rent a room there and then move on there to record a practice.
If you have the video tape from a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact-checkers and then show their results under the original contribution, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It's one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that using updated machine learning methods will begin to identify possible false messages and send them to fact-checkers who may show the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where the French voters have been overrun in front of the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to succeed in eliminating hate-filled posts as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate German statement that a test of new facts will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge which stories of third-party fact-checkers are being challenged, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "linked article" and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scottish Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottey has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a favorite for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says softly.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teath and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.
"I have only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a doppelganger in the 1700s who worked for the Jakobians," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, smell has an effect, as if he were himself.
Oh, I love archive!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome size"), all this seems to be nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had been buried in the tomb for centuries.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape managers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scottney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundred years ago in which Aristotle said "Oh, throw it on the roof".
Journals, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who possessed what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a church to fight for the two families.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farm revolt.
"There is a recording of an emergency that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farm revolt began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of Jesus' father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own baptism by filling a sardk with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sardk was dug).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' favorite family of Scottney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty good guys, always making debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to hire ties."
After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish Wild for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotty has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to get done with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marine chapel hidden in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marien chapel in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Even until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret about Nelson Artz.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Very nice for us.
Or?", the action maker has been asking about the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle since yesterday.
"We don't really think so," they wrote on their website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
In the action it is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is up to us to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable single-setting feature."
Finally, they competed with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Each year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transfers in the military corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish military a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The consultations were also attended by the five Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs under the chairmanship of the Government.
So the civilians in the YAS were in too many.
The government is pulling the trigger in the military.
Chief General Hulsi Akar is still in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been suspended.
Since the failed coup, chief Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and Admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gulen, who sees Erdogan as the wired bearer of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara this week.
Already on the day after the pout, Erdogan had referred to the coup attempt as a "gift of God" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean up the fighting forces completely".
But does Erdogan really have the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unhappiness in the military headquarters".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamicization" of the army, which is manifesting itself, among other things, in the abolition of the Capitol ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the major cleansing of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan sent another 7395 officials to fire by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan had slowed down the military.
The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they praised their role as guardians of the world order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military's power step by step, not least in calling for the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say Erdogan drives towards Islamization of the fighting forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unspecified officer who was looking for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafiists" in a few years.
If this happens, such development could not keep the nato cold.
Nevertheless, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the cleansing.
The management structures and operational capabilities have been "weak", according to NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in both Chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and this will do by changing the way the United States is spending its citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to repair routes for racing shuttles
It has always been disputed over the future of the race shuttle in the past months - now it should go quite quickly.
Even before the end of the year, they are to be built on the muddy track on which the tourist track runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the race shuttle, construction work is still scheduled to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and repairing the Ilmenau race route, the country recognises this connection especially important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of maintaining the route was around EUR 2.5 million.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is now finally agreed, declared sail.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is why the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This is to be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The race trail shuttle is a particularly popular railway link between the railway stations Ilmenau and the race trail.
In the past months, during a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly in the future.
In addition, the route is highly cotton in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of the chest and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies deliver every amount of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern expatriates have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone hat that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and by selecting everything, from the robot's eye color through the shape of the toes to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.
Modern expatriates have developed into robots with a silicone hood.
For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "advantage" personality.
"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," True Companion's website said.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underwrought female characteristics, the perceptions of rape, when you take a step on frigid (here called "responsive") Farrah, disturb most of them.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxxy compares with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing refinements point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they remain on the edge of consumer culture.
But what is guaranteed from the border zones can be very instructive about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not unusual or policing until the free market allows them to do so.
There is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a President in the White House who has called for women to be sexually assaulted.
The most frightening aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magd Report') are not the graphic images, the naked bodies and the outlying eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if any with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they are following the movement of a real body.
But the robots are not real women when it comes to their "personalities".
They cannot separate from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total rejection.
In other words, they are falling slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech:
Trump's great performance?
He makes Romney a part of the healthy human mind
It has become a business idea of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families into small-scale information.
Around Christmas and Easter there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's elective relatives.
We all seem to be working hard to place our filter bubbles.
Less notice is the power of Trump to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
It is certainly a good thing about the table, but I find it in another context that this also poses significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the creative effect of his presidency has the power to move all of us to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrible possibility that his measurements will no longer hit us one day.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, which is "normalized" in the Trump Republican of the right wing, which suddenly appears to include reasonableness in comparison to its standard.
I find myself today from an active nostalgia for the middle of Romney's URCOME version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of which were in fact a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are clumsy and the animals turn around to look with fear over their own shoulders - extremely window and the climbing music conveys this in a remarkable way.
So many of a city's clichés are disappointed: the views of high buildings will be old, the skylines will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified in the dream.
Fifty-five years later, and I'm still not far from the day when I found out that Swiss cotton is actually not a Swiss cotton - the theme pub Ye Old Swiss cotton does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a rare magical experience, since there are two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and everyone has a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full number of points, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced into a shopping house to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.
In the coffeehouse at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink - this to buy something over the charger.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the shopping house was terribly shy, while I was tired of having her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison transferred to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he reportedly left to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal from the state prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steinkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nightly intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Apple, from which they say they are too careful.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said it would be challenged by the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Bluberger Schools, the four-clauses were released from foothills and Epfenhofen in the holidays and further schools.
Three of the graduates are going to the gym in the future, four to the real school.
Schoolmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken yard, but will then be released to freedom.
In addition, the coined charar introduced a musical titled "Der Adler in Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it explode from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a cock fell, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain.
After that, the classes showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young gocks who wore cylinders around the bets.
The Adler stood for integration, said schoolmaster Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (cows), it is one of them.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed the words of thanks to the colleagues, former school principal Michael Müller, who always jumped back to the classrooms, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen time is now over, Professor Sophia Schumacher explained.
They leave their students after two years of teaching only very lean, because it has been a really great time.
Finally, they can rely on the fourth key.
Finally, all students were able to sing a song of summer time and holiday time.
The children were very happy about this.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs quoted from television.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegal tenting people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation was under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks shall continue throughout the whole season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What the affected need to know now
How exactly is the software update going on?
Should diesel drivers participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and in part of the Euro 6.
Euro-4 or worse diesels are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their refurbishment has been ordered by the KBA.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a prompt implementation in the coming months but have not yet mentioned an exact date.
Daimler has informed us to write to everyone concerned.
If an inspection is due, it will be carried out within their framework.
How long should the equipment go together?
"It's hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The refurbishment itself could take only three to four hours at the workshop.
Time-consuming might be to get a date.
What do drivers who don't drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would be drawn, says Smethanein.
Is there a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where traffic bans are threatened.
In the rural area there are so far no losses of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prizes of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host and participate with his wife Melania in the ceremony.
For this reason, Lear, who became known as a progressive TV series, announced that he would refuse to participate in the gala.
The "New York Times" said: "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and it imposes on me."
The 59-year-old Stefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify their views.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city viable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's City Building Master, is going to rent next year.
The job is already written out - however, suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder.
And work still makes him great fun, as he communicates in the press.
He reports on various but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible.
This is to be done - taking into account the regular deadlines - there is still enough time to prepare.
Since Haslach acts as a Lower Construction Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city anyway.
If they were no longer able to complete these, the citizens had to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But closer to citizens is the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports a good business climate and a good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years at the office, some important projects have been gathered, looking back at the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city viable," he is sure about the building and his employees.
But also in the future, many different projects are on the agenda: For example, the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Lower-hope parking lot are under attack.
The kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and stadiumization is still the subject.
The last one alone is going to hit the book with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
Designally it is available for a city master of large play space.
With Haslach's own building and gardening, you can react quite flexibly to many.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the greenery is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city as an ensemble is under memorial protection, it is important to "have an eye for what is clean", when new buildings are approved, the distinguished city builder emphasizes.
But the mayor has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "it's all over my table at the end."
He can count on long-term employees in support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been Manfred Schöner (Deepbau) for ten years.
Even that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies himself with the place and wants to stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Those who want to acquire Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study as a diplomat or a bachelor with professional direction of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law.
The city building is subject to high and deep construction, construction planning, basic business matters, management of the city properties, the city farm with building and gardening as well as the Lower Construction Authority including monumental protection.
Cycling cast on wires: Southway closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had cast the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of the Leobene Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the accompanying goods were to be stopped.
The investigators have gone out of two men and have been searching for them since nightfall.
Near the tabernacle were seen by witnesses a rosary roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a loop line," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
They or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also risked train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement traffic, there could also be ponals of the railway customers to the perpetrators.
All in all, it was a "important" sum," said the speaker.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains fell out on Friday morning, two of which involved remote traffic.
Goods didn't fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, approximately 200 meters of overheads had to be exchanged.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory dark)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an alpine dream for your digestion system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory thyroid disease.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bruising, recurrent or bleeding disorders, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the victims are usually told to avoid meat and milk products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammation of the skin.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria need tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment, if the same system works in humans.
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but that was not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mucous membranes of the mouse - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach.
The hermes of the mice were sequenced DNA and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mouse was raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbial and did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. Reuters and the immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affected the immune system, researchers let L. reuteri grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the fluid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were half-lifed, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. Reuters are protecting in our stomach intestines.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory thyroid disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high trytopan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genie"
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the halter role, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched after popularity.
Matic, however, was excluded from the Asia-Preparation Tour of the Blues and only created 45 minutes, which Maurinho added that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romeo Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, when Maurinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new obligations, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to meet three of its four priority new obligations.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've done a lot of work."
Melting "Painted" Dreamliner in Heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the Silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the U.S., which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such an advertisement before.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New Deepfall for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of SPD, Social Democratic Prime Ministers were always looking forward to elections with a certain concern for Berlin.
Only no fire from the party center, only no wind from the federal party - as was the most important wish of the voters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-House have been observing the events in the SPD-controlled capital cities with growing dissipation.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.
It was a deep blow.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against SPD and Green Coalitions.
"This shows once again: Red Green simply cannot rule reliably," said General Secretary Peter Tauber to the German editing network (RND).
The surprising Group of Greens MPs has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Greens-Bundessellner Michael Kellner has called on the abstinent Dutch Greens-Adgent Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The infringement of the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the electorate.
Every Tvesten must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Trade and Election Leader of the Greens to the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
"This must not be all true," says an SPD-Walkwart, when on Friday morning the new hiobs message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, President of the SPD Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the violation of the Green MEP Elke Twest to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no longer, calmed down the companions of his day.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
That was then also - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel led the SPD to the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite is now a smooth party.
It was hard to recall the companions again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And the next blow came with him.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphil harmony while burning his city.
And because after that, in the crisis communication, he made quite the wrong thing to do.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now, even Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Mies surveyed were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just why, because in the past few weeks he tried to put more emphasis on the fed.
The aim of Hanover's former mayor to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from fellows in the area of Martin Schulz.
They let him give it because they promised to stabilise the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
There is basically no blame on the party's internal branch of the Low-Saxon Greens.
And not Schulz anymore.
At times, therefore, the partners try to keep their own rows closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here in particular at the depressive Parliamentarian of the West.
"It is inconvenient and democratical, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests at the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Links in the SPD-Fundaags fraction, the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mrs Tvesten has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person, but has been elected to Parliament by the Dutch Greens' national list, as the Dutch Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she gave up her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Fundaagsfaction, complained of a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electoral will four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal memory of a future CDU MP is misleading the result," Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Financing for site III
Anyone who wants to clean up a house in the years to come can soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in Recepting.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back at what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been areas in Receptingen Sanierungs.
At that time, in Rehabilitation Area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant remained at 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote internal development as well, and not just to unlock new areas.
On 4 April, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there would be a rehabilitation area III.
The aid amounted to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country, the rest of which were received from the municipality.
How does a rehabilitation area come about?
You will, as Schindler continues, investigate where the "old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in improving whether there is any interest in the planned area.
Where appropriate, the boundaries of the area could then be re-moved.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday.
Keller presented the contents of the federal program "Social City", in which the repairs would then be carried out.
The main features of the programme are the revitalization of cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object, i.e. by property.
The area of repair would then be defined as a statute.
The period of authorisation for the funds shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the inventory would only be completed, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area were given a questionnaire to complete.
In November or December, as far as possible, the legislative decision will be taken so that the reforms can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then stated that each municipality had to carry out the alleged pre-trial investigations.
It is up to us to assess and decide when urban disasters will be cured and to what extent.
A repair note will also be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come back to receiving and make himself a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that an essential success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the public in the coming weeks and can be filled by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property book", where it concerns, among other things, the state of construction and the purposes of restoration.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and housing" page, data can be made about the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room.
The Blue "Operation" is only to be completed when operating in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new measures are not conducive.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds according to the "Windhund" principle works - who comes first, first, paint.
You can't afford to "reserve" later.
Finally, still photos of the project "Place core II" were shown to make the guests a "tasteful" repair.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his house door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between fingers and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a premium of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military's reports left to the TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and leading officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter produced in Connecticut was issued in addition to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Commander of the Air Force.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17th at 7:00 p.m. for the event at 3:00 p.m., and stayed so long until the race was cleared at 18:00 p.m. to 21:00 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the reduced hours of service, a second crew would be required for the return.
The original flight crew was on the ground during the helicopter event, while the unit's safety personnel remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft.
The records provided by the TIM did not make clear whether a second flight crew was finally required.
The Hatch Act prohibits the use of state-owned property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could harm the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander said.
"It sounds like you're closed," replied the Deputy Commander.
The event "Made in America" was called by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an attack on the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate and promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.
But demanding their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted a survey in February when the Presidential plane was operating in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the Presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled by the "Made in America" show - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in South Lawn to put the U.S. presidents in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, one official said.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for "Non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for Presidential Flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to US Ministry of Defence's hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, however, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"To determine the costs for taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the rates of reimbursement for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract termination.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are produced in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal State Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he walked over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a firearm.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW News before Clumsy Task
The top rider of the second tennis league is Suchsdorfer SV at the third table.
The TC Blue-Weiss News will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table Sochsdorfer SV.
Despite the fact that five parties still have a smooth balance, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a fairly similar formation.
Just in the rear positions, I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the search village SV, the imports from the high north are mainly ensured.
" Their Danes and Finns can even refer to activities in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It will always be hard for us.
You also need a good portion of happiness."
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If it does not create active French currently in the challenger tournament in the Italian Biella, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) will be the first player in this season at the tournament in the Czech Liberec.
The previously unoccupied Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the White Russ Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could again join the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, which was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay fills the box.
How America can harm the OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump did not work happily when he placed his signature under the law on tightening the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday.
"In his haste to pass the law," the Congress packed a few "constitutional rules", he said.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and Brussels itself was shy of the US advance.
The draft is always designed to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
In this respect, investors of domestic OMVs have since been concerned, who together with other European companies are co-financed by the construction of the Russian East Seabed Nord Stream 2.
The drugs are violent.
However, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to raise the sanctions even by executive order to live.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" looked at which of the groups could refuse and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is pushed into the center of Netflix’s speed range.
Despite the second staff of Narcos, revealed by Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is not far from over.
The three and four bars were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third staff, the DEA has focused its attention on the world's richest drug trade organization: the Cali cartel.
Noted by four powerful patents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" with only more state-owned attacks and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) in New York City.
In the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type invited by American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
More new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bish and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role backward: The city employs 46 kitchens
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is returned to the city’s children’s places.
On 1 September, the town of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city's children's day facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pomeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We have all been very pleased".
Cooked is still out of the house: A catheter takes over this task and delivers freshly chilled cooked.
The city operates 46 children's places in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children were sitting on the tables, and the need is constantly growing.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the Kita to noon," explains Pomeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care if children stay up to 14 hours."
46 Part-time forces have from September 1st kitchen: they heat the angel-made foods, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, share the meal individually, deliver the food, clean up, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kit," says Pomeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups of institutions - decides over the range of hours.
"The kitchen assistants now belong firmly to the Kita team," says Pomeranz satisfied.
"So they're much more involved and it's easy to implement pedagogical concepts for the process."
That is why it is also true: healthy nutrition and cooking.
"The kids are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
For the kids, too.
"They have a known force in the Kita, a person who trusts them, and not always changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The purification of the Kita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen authorities - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, also the charm that it has displayed itself in the cost comparison between self-regulatory and abroad for the city as the most economical, it is from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-set.
"But these hours, about 750 people in the education area, don't get so much weight," says Sonja Pomeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate in unlimited participation and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats to an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to a consultative role.
This year the elections will be handed over for the first time from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.
Hiking to the TV Jubilee
Due to its 110-year-old existence, the TV Kaiseren invites you to a small walk with subsequent coffee and cakes.
The hike starts on Sunday, July 9, at 1 p.m. in Frohstette at the water reservoir in the Americas street.
From there it goes back to the airport until the night and over the Waldhof back to the water reservoir.

Men Try 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to try to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police, the 13-year-olds who were staying with friends on the Kolping Street called at 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old refused, however, and went on with her friends.
Then one of the criminals tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, which was wrong.
Without a bite, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to assure the managers of the McVitie Biskuit manufacturer of the long-term obligation to produce in its work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which is produced by Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to learn" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the branch manager of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie called for "to be concerned that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross involves our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workers are very focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie."
A spokesperson from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies that operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a fully-fledged production site. If our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left behind in his persecution of Neymar after he has made an offer of £189 million to release his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record collapse?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 Club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sportsman in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way outside, although there is a source near the Catalan government that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago?
As Manchester City 2014 showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matudi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to be signed by one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with themselves, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, while the Spanish Association expressed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roll over and damaged
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a roller left in the King's field road before the number 30 was present, thus causing damage to the vehicle's clothing of more than 200 euros.
The Schramberg Police, Phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for instructions.
In an accident at B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because he was hit by a car on his trail, the driver of a VW Touran had to leave and touch the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau was on his way to Leese.
In the area of the district of Stolzenau, he had a car on his trail, so he had to turn right.
The Touran-Fahrer touched the guideboards.

The driver of the matching car, a Mercedes Benz, had overloaded a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the injured person, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the cause vehicle to contact the Commission office in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report discharged Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the Canal of Abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the Reform Movement "We are the Church", declared after publication against the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful in the view of the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own neglects or their mistaken assessment of the proceedings at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised that the reporting on violence in dominoes will be measured with "two-fold".
With regard to the violations in Regensburg, no one is concerned that they are "disgusting and shameful acts" which should be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "Grade Medial Manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Committee of Bioethics.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," says Scaraffia.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian radio: "You'd like to go to church and that's a french found".
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beats have been a very normal pedagogical means" to "be done with ugly children, as I was one".
She found it unfair to apply today's standards to decades ago, because the world has changed.
In connection with reports of abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
Totally wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," Hesemann says, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by Lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg with the disclosure?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of abuse, 67 Domspatten.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, therefore, it can be said that in many cases the master of Domcapell R. used forms of physical and mental violence.
Just with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more severe.
However, unlike many other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the scandal of abuse by the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger dissipates.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "events of violence against law enforcement officers at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholericist and perfectionist, who became handy when a domspatz musically did not bring the top performance.
How do you, as his biographer, value this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you are having trouble reading the entire 440 pages long report from front to back, you need to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He has just been dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of coercion or coercion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its scope.
He may at any time be asked to learn too late or not to have taken the first statements seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all the respondents as - so verbally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Likewise, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony, describes him as "hot", "loved", "exact", "competent" and "intellectual", as extremely kind teachers who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and were "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to outbreaks.
Not only did he kneel with his chairs and threw the key-bound on the floor, but he also spread ears and pulled all the rough boys to the hair or ears, he gave himself up years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, it must be said to his honour that such education methods were widely disseminated at the time, in the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us that was born before 1968.
I've also experienced this in a world school, a state high school.
Compared with what is actually going on in this report, namely the excessive sexual abuse and violence at preschool, these are free bacteriums.
It is already a question of whether it has nothing to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just knocked on him.
In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still zealous.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburg Domspatten.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any development or awareness of sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Not at all.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claim to have trusted the Master of the House.
Not even the parents were committed.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned representative for the others, "It was all very painful for me."
The real problem with the detection of sexual abuse was that most victims of shame remain silent.
If they don't even trust their parents and siblings, then it's not exactly a choir leader who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do Domspatten-Schoulers Ratzinger's Role in Abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student interrogated formulated it as follows: "Furthermore, sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the individual offender.
I think it... also for really absurd, to assume that it is calculated to him ... Bubbles have opened up more intimidating or clearer or more than their parents, interns, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - unforgivable."
The report therefore concludes with the clear conclusion: "The fact that he was entrusted with students and/or their environment in the past could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
Thus, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any conscience.
Neither can he be denied, prevented, or brought to the notice.
There is therefore no reason to link his good name with these reprehensible crimes, as it has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "violence" to read at the Regensburg domspazen.
The previous master of the house Georg Ratzinger will be presented in the report "Sightseeing".
Does he have to live with this draft?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything in the report was mixed and mixed into a huge melancholy of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that's exactly what this report is all about.
This is where it becomes clear: between preschool and the gymnasium of domspatz, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, once again, we say, other harassments.
In addition, the report has dealt with events since 1945, also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Domespatz.
The whole terrible prügeldagogy, the cases in which children of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and tortured and subjected to brutal treatment, all agreed on the preschool in the underground and Pilenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.
But with them, Master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with, because he got the boys face-to-face when they were already at the Homespatzengymnasium.
It was on the subject of "preschool" tabu, as most witnesses stressed.
You were just happy to be away from her and enjoy the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was there on the dompatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence".
That's how you're gonna keep your head down and keep your head down.
However, despite all the efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the pre-school state.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and from the proceedings at a school where he had not just acted and was responsible, (so the Witness) did not want to hear anything and then only again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close his ears in front of the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He pointed out this, "that in pre-school the punishment will continue to be practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when trial sentences were also prohibited in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that, they qualified in a legal grey zone, as any of us would probably know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the allowable limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the Přügelspaße at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fallstick of anachronism", that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the prince's right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has always been repugnant, nor to what was interrupted in the preschool on abuse and violence against innocent children, which is far beyond what was then customary.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, that is to say, to draw ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also adhered strictly to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger given you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of the Přügelspaße also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the Domitians played only one side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hesitate that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said once: without this perfectionism, without requiring unrestricted discipline, it would not have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the rather well-known Regensburg Domspatz until then, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, you can now make no great singers out of reprehensible kids and stand before every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-restraint.
As a man, have you experienced Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, profound, deeply believing and good-hearted person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something to cause a flight.
I get regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
So those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once harsh with them are clearly in the minority.
Most dominoes are grateful to him today for enriching his life and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a loving respectable person to whom they still look up to today and who they worship too.
And please, once again quite clearly: all that is being suggested to him is education methods that were then on the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overhauled this time for a long time.
But it is most unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sinner.
There is the evil intent behind it all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the claim would be that a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would not know the Regensburg Homeland Patten at all in peace.
