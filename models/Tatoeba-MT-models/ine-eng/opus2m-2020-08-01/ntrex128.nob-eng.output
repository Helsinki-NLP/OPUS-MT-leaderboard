Welsh Members do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today under the Am (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal will result from the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
Representatives of the entire political spectrum fear that this may lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Party explained that his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means ‘dwstette’ and pwp means ‘bæsj’.
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was "unsatisfying" and that they had proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ for the name change, but noting that the expression of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is expressed in a similar way as the letter U is expressed in the English Yorkshire dialect, more than a ‘uh’ sound.
Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: ‘Of course, it is the Members themselves who have the last right to determine the name to be mentioned.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation that showed general support for revamping the National Assembly of the Wallisian Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives supported by the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
The representatives propose a number of other options, but making all parties reach an agreement can lead to the head office of President Elin Jones of Parliament, who will, in accordance with the plan, deliver a legislative draft of the name change over the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the national assembly, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last right to vote on what they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians go to the elections to determine whether the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on whether their name should be changed to ‘North Macedonia’.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a further ten years' dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in their territory and has on several occasions opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is quite simply the price they have to pay for participation in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silencer – the screams in Harlem wear
“The old ones I spoke to have told me that before that time there was a bar and a church on each corner,” says Adams.
«Now there are none of the parts.»
He said the barber's departure was understandable.
‘People are socially intertwined in other ways’, he says.
«Bars are no longer the places of meeting of the local environment, which are regularly visited by all».
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe: ‘And before or after they are back at the beginning.’
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining time.
‘Most of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘and therefore will only hasten the day when these churches must close the doors too well, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.’
Both screams were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist team moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black community under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main assistants – because they did not employ or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson’s son - in - law left plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: «a cultural tax» and «an irreplaceable historical instrument».
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of which have been initiated by the Church's law enforcement and others by the bishop.
The Council of the Church – the management of the church, consisting of legislators – wrote to the bishop in July of its concern that the bishop came to ‘try to impose the costs’ on the Council of the Church, despite the fact that the Council had not been involved in the inception of the architects or contractors sent by the bishop.
Some sleepy child complained about lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Hai damages 13-year-olds in California
A hi-attack and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared for lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had drowned with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy called out of curiosity about having caught a lobster, but he realized after all that the boy called out 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His whole throat was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I called out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of hai that made the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are to make its entrance to the British Beauty Market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with merchandise-like jewelry and beauty care tanks, which are equipped with specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are tested out in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong intake in the UK's 2.8 million beauty care market, which is still growing while the sales figures for clothing and household items fall.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the efforts of the supermarket to find a new use area for the place used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's said they should double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybellline, and Burt's Bees will also be better placed in noted brands, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also resells its Boutique brand with mainly vegan products, as demand for this among younger customers is increasing.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out the sales table in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Net trading and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local day-care shops means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's said that the sales will each resemble more and more on a product magazine, taking up the fight against the Aldi and Lidl cheap stores with several services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated after a scandal concerning the distribution of income from pharmacists in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold its 281 shopkeepers to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury leather marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty care halls to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be so ready to provide advice and assistance.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting environments and practical locations make us now a beauty-care competitor that represents a new business experience.»
Peter Jones is "racing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' The star Peter Jones must certainly be furious after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories, True.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is programmer in this Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The Star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last seconds to focus on their own new gold-based contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “racing” at a busy meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that her new contracts – worth GBP 1.5 million – were recognized as no longer time left for their dress and accessories brand, True.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
At the same time as Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave True, Jones the Great left on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was mistakenly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her economic security over the next decades.
Everyone's completely shocked that she's chosen to go.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the main quarter of Marlow which is now ready for sale.»
Experts believe that this morning programmer, who is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, may cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as Putter and Light, Mote and Coscler, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Poor mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby established True with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became the Chairman of the Board of Directors in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host for the I'm A Celebrity I'm.
A source standing near Jones yesterday said, "We won't comment on his business."
Chefs «and then we fell in love»
He knew about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of having made a comment some would consider "little Presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his copy of a news thinker.
«I have not given away anything.»
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after he himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major piece of shit on the road to nuclear destruction of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a ‘comparative response’ from the United States of America on its early take-off measures.
He noted that the United States still has sanctions designed to keep the press up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his electors.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We kept going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his work to improve Kim's relationship has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rockets, helping to get rid of hostages and getting the lives of American service people sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this step-by-step arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed to the area right in front of us.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia breeds an island and kills hundreds of people
In the cold water of the Lombok earthquake, foreign leading organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of the inhabitants of Lomboks had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be submitted.
‘In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international aid, so it is quite challenging,’ Sombang explained.
Save the children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national crisis management stage, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the constant exposure to Indonesia’s earthquakes, the country is extremely poorly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Light to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning signal at Palu, even though a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Even in the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the destination of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo upgraded Indonesia's paramilitary infrastructure to a major point in his campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for the Yoko administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have moved to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslims returned to the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in the fight against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League losing against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting in 89 minutes at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a fit from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while making his 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high above the box as the ball split toward the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players that Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can do, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
«I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and I didn’t think too much of it and just kicked it away.»
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a fit with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the center of the track and sprinted into the Liverpool part of the track.
Kovacic came with a quick handover on the central track.
He then made four of a nice breakthrough that led to Hazard's entry into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left foot kicking past Liverpool's Alice Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League for Men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The deaths from tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The deaths following Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami have increased to 832, the country’s crisis management status was announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings like the collapse after the earthquake with a 7,5 strike that hit the country on Friday and caused a wave of up to six meters, explained Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with materials from razed buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A killer investigation has started after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was attacked, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "We're all at the beginning of the investigation, but I'd like to ask everyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, especially the driver of the taxi, who may have caught something on his car camera, to contact – they may have information that is essential to our investigation.»
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the dead woman was a permanent resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
In the afternoon friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim.
A drone driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been informed that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was aimless when he discovered what had happened.
People are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the whole area was now being treated as a sanctuary.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats "it's so terrible" about it again and again.
At 14 a.m., two police cars were standing behind the barrier, while a third car was standing outside.
A number of police officers were outside the block and had an overview of the apartment complex.
Persons with information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by reference to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
The status quo of the Parliament of Cromwell is the last monument to be incorporated into the ‘rewrite history’.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of the cultural and religious treasures of England that were carried out by his fanatic puritanic followers.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's edition as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a target.
The iconoclass of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s and is part of histories for a man many still deserve to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is becoming of many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen as Parliament’s defences against the outside press – of course in his time it was about the monarchy.
If this is a very accurate representation, it is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.»
Kill gray takes life off Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on its market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only after the name ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered by blood from a broken pulse year near a bank on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to place vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005, in the town of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had probably traveled with his fat from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the fat found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig road was open.
He said inside the pig's way there was a big pit with blood on his mouth.
A medical examination confirmed, according to the report, that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
“The bones to my fat were bloody and maltreated” explained the fat, referred to by the last name Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his fat.
While the police together gave evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
The Yuan family and the management of the market are negotiating a certain amount of compensation for the death.
Although this is the case, it is not the first time that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a married couple at a farm in Massachusetts and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife was able to hunt the animal out.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
«The only heart.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're trying not to hurt anyone.
You only have to show sufficient respect.»
The remnants of the hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in South-West America
According to the report, hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, lead to a flood of rain during her journey through North Mexico and South West America during the next few days.
Rosa had a wind power of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tide begins to form over the Pacific and move east towards the west coast of the United States. With the Rosa approaching Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity north towards southwestern USA.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Afterwards, the cooperation between tropical humidity and the drought that is approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid noise and rapid and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Dyptropic humidity will result in precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are options for fluxes with rapid deterioration due to the spread tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert to foot as long as there is danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain may lead to river valleys becoming wide-brown rivers, and drought will lead to local gusts that may contain dust and sand.
The narrowing will lead to local strong rain showers for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfall of more than 1,3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid noise and speed, as well as smooth roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the area of rainy weather.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner countries on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the troops stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences across the central US on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of Central and Eastern USA will probably get a hot start in October, with high degrees in the 20th from Southern Plains to parts of North-East USA.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that the East-U.S. will most likely have temperatures higher than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, saw Thursday's arresting testimony from the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that was due to occur in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political campaign continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce the great surprise of Friday in the last seconds, when it became clear that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she was 100 percent sure that a pregnant Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a youth school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company estimated average number of views for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seer numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the Nielsen has usually problems measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this number is equal to the final game of American football championship or Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose speakers have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, was led by the networks, with an average number of 5.69 million for the whole day's hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main person for Friday's drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the lift to a meeting of the court committee while demonstrators screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes lowered for several minutes while he was separated, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling our country the truth?"
He heard that "you have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office had come with an opinion, and said that the elevator door closed that he had come to have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings just several hours later, as the court committee had to vote on whether to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh to the entire Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of political games around Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to drive the political game with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, the printed page on her own page on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called ‘Checkers’ plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was ‘very ridiculous’.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police attack Dyteon Simpson, suspected to have caused the LSU's death
Police have attacked a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for deliberate murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the Basket.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he admitted having shot and killed Wayde.
His bail is set to USD 350 000, according to The Advocate.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a gunshot wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for its working group on the acquisition of refugees, the State Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for contributing to the investigation leading to an attack.
LSU's sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the region's police force for its "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "knout" and "in shock" after Wayne's death.
"That's what we're afraid of at all times," Wade said.
Volcano spray ash over Mexico City
The ash that flows out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighbours of Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Preventción de Disasters, Mexico’s public state of crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity had been stepped up and 183 gas and ashes emissions were recorded during one day.
The State monitored several cases of tingling and shaking.
Pictures of social media showed a thin layer of ashes that covered windscreens on cars in neighboring like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 rusted central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors for independence had clashed with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists were held back from the riot police and bombed them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later on the day, when the police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours independent demonstrators and called ‘Never forget, never forgive’ stood face to face with Unionist demonstrators called ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor damage they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the 1 October public vote, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming surplus of liberation, but it was poorly met because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the release.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations yesterday, after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups lie in the streets on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, however, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist test with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
"Yesterday we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy of getting a vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping the pressure up this year, after many of their well-known leaders have travelled in self-established exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was perpetrated by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation is becoming more and more tense,’ he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have waited for a court case late in the fourth year, announced that he will be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To stand for elections as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and retreat from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after driving a car several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armrest may also have been pushed against the car at a time.
Mengas attack leads to Livingstone 1-0 wins against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured winner
Revived Livinston surprised Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good match from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now just like the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won on the trail of Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home combating Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, has remained neutral through six matches in the division. Chief Holt has not yet lost a match since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against his slender guests
Holt's law should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but the bombed on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kicked forward after sneaking in to meet Craig Halkett's head past the target.
The Society Lot Rangers played ahead, well aware that they could create problems for their guests at death.
And that's how the crucial goal came to be.
Rangers gave away a fresh park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had had largely seen the ball all the time, but the home team's defense had proved to be insurmountable and targeted Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos performed a near-score score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers' Keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a short-term fit.
Crossings still entered the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal charges – once after Halket's protest against the exchange of Glenn Middleton, and once for hands – were translated.
« Phenomenal» from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all together, and they keep going beyond all expectations on the way up.
The style of the game and the humanity have changed little since they came to the top again, but Holt must have much of the honor for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on toes throughout the fight.
Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration to sign with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the fight was labs – they only entered half of the site once – and it was a little bit of an awakening for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There has been a division of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open an enormous new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police declared security as the reason that a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – were also heard from themselves, criticizing both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to let him into the country.
The opposing demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is treated as a whole by some German Turks and is hated as an autocrat by others.
Deepford collision: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist is killed in a collision with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the intersection between Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a travelling road in the south of Deptford, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a raid where the driver escaped from the Children Street station, about a mile away from the raid.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the affected.
Roadblocks and bus rides are in place, and drivers are the Council to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in raids
Six prison officers have been injured in an incident in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Swallows broken out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and continues.
Specialized “Tornado” officers are brought in to handle the event, involving eight employees and limited to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial damage on site.
A prison service spokesperson said: ‘Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind lock-and-run."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 employees, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an employee.
And in October last year, the riot police were summoned to handle a serious incident where the employees were attacked with billiards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (may be favourable for drought areas)
It is the sign of Arizona being hit by a tropical low pressure, but it will probably happen early next week, as the remaining force of the hurricane of Rosa moves through the deserts of the southwest and leads to a flood.
National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainy season will start late Monday evening.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "Ti tropical cyclones have maintained their status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.’
The latest National Hurricane Center models require 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm of individual locations in Mongolon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain range, are likely to reach between 2,5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of danger, Rosa may be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be favourable, since the South West is currently in a drought.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, which is the next highest category’, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane hits the country of Rosa at the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has energy in the morning, with a maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and loses its power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storms on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be strong and lead to great fluctuations.
‘Total precipitation of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with possibilities for up to 25 cm rainfall’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it reaches the border of Arizona gruesome Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which then moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
‘The main risk expected by Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, North West Sonora and the South West Desert in the USA’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening streams and liquid and rapid rains in the desert and earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attack for murder attempts
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are attacked, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found the knife piece in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04.00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were attacked during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who can have a mobile recording of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has ‘members of the minority and the mind’ of the democratic party
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the thoughtless and shocking tactics of the democratic party," Trump said in front of a People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been “members of the minority and mind” of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the convention on Thursday, and denied the strong and emotional charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford is also testifying to his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, powerful and courageous" was that day.
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most powerful lawyers of our time, with complete freedom of choice in public service”, he told a assembly of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans voting at the elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That is why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.’
Trump claimed that the Democrats have the objective of "opposing and preventing".
The Senate's first interim vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to which the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party has told CNN.
Several hundred deaths of Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were taken to sea by huge waves that ravaged the beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, when up to six meters of high waves ravaged the country around sunset, ravaged everything in its path and dragged many into the drowning death.
Tsunami came in the hills on an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami arose yesterday, people continued to drive with activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s crisis management status (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
‘Tsunami was not alone – it drove cars, wooden trunks and houses, it hit everything on land’, Nugroho said, and let the tsunami move over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed into trees to escape from the tsunami and survived.»
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Crisis Management State showed many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Fear continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be identified by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's state of assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the force from the enormous earthquake of Friday was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the state.
Nugroho described the damage as «inclusive» and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The corpses of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death and damage may be the coast of a larger country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is close to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely corroborated, completely without information’ from Dongala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said Red Cross in a press release, leaving their staff and volunteers on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the state was severely criticized for not being informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man at the top floor of a building called desperate warnings that tsunamis are approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water is flowing toward the beach, breaking down buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuations still desperately need food and other needs.
The city’s airport is open only for auxiliary work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths after tsunamis in Indonesia increases to over 800.
It's awful.
World Visions staff from Dongala have arrived safely at the Palu centre, where they have sought light during the performances on the farm in front of their office, but the past major damage on the road, according to Doseba Sinai.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses," he said.
It's awful.
As relief organisations began their desperate preparations to provide crisis assistance, some complained that foreign assistants with much expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis zone until it has been declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says 'Greet, this is a national disaster' we can open the limits of international aid, but the situation has not yet received any status.’
As the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after the earthquake of Friday and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still missing their love will be among the miraculous stories that shed light on the sad news of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out by a witch.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescuers after spending two days trapped under the ruins of her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the national paragliding team, had thirty-two of the missing paragliders for Asian doctors, which was implemented earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandadi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional to bear," he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to grey crochet marks, rather than a couple of blue crochet marks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thiver steals USD 26 750 under minibank refill in Newport on the Live
On Friday morning, he stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's employee who filled a minibank in Newport on the Livee, according to a press release from Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and was ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy there was another man who "run up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses so many suspicious rumors from the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the event.
All who have information about their identity must contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation was previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye over a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she canceled on an "emotional basis", according to the serialist.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's accession president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military troops fought against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education bring young people into criminal justice.
The United States should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use for research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performer of artificial intelligence, who has the job for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have come with announcements of artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, in turn, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance of the next great performance of artificial intelligence coming from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a leader of Microsoft Research or director of the Google Chinese Department.
Lee recognized the US government's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find next-generation smart heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state funding, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a degree of doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permit automatically”, he said.
China's Council of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation is funding people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academies, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at establishing a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has been halted for several months.
Macedonians vote in public vote on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a public vote Sunday on whether to change the country's name to ‘North Macedonia’ in order to resolve a further ten years' dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has put down its veto against including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the public vote, and a boycotting campaign has raised doubts as to whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The issue of voting is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece?’
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the country's future, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial because a large number of Members have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said they had not received any irregularity reports by 13 a.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The Macedonian People's vote is about to change the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Prior to the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) outlined a small scene and brought forward chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we will be notified with a raised head, not being let in the rear," Kavadarkov says.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they won't accept us as Macedonia, we can return to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Minister of State Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to a wound-tight investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think most will be because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He says that a ‘yes’ response will be a ‘confirmation of our future’.
According to a poll issued last month by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of eligible voters will participate in the public vote – this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the respondents have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they were going to vote yes.
In order for the public vote to be valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the public vote fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has supported since it took over last May.
See: Manchester Cities Sergio Aguero manipulates throughout Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester Citys 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously light when he scored a target for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a match at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran around with three Brighton defenders before he got out on an open path.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a fit to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to hit Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the network.
“Aguero still wears some footing problems,” the City Manager told the press.
«We talked about he came to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky he scored a target right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball placed on Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful passageway across the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net right before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and there is no reason to put up with it.
The always equally competitive Scherzer, however, hopes to stand on the path on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, which runs over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in the NL West.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 win over the National Friday night, but is still out to secure its first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the vote here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of battle I get this year.
Why would I not participate in it?"
The Nationals have still not announced their launch pitcher for Sunday, but must certainly be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for 34 times, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and would throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-wing Washington player won 18 matches this season and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump’s People’s Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discreetly to the situation around the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for the Republicans to vote at the elections.
“All we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant.
Trump continued: "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power at any price.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have the objective of "opposing and preventing".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "sin and bad and dirty and dishonest".
He referred to the Senate's judicial committee and referred to the democratic senator Diane Feinstein by name, on which the audience was adjourned.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you played the document?
Um, um, huh.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to sensory me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am despite all the last of a number of Labour Members who have been informed that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of antisemitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be sensory because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
How important it is to have responsible economic policies, national security, Europe – ironically similar things that the Jeremys disagreeed with previous leaders.
At the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday it was said that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour Representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the vote at many of the meetings, and the promise of a softer, more friendly policy is too long forgotten if it has started at all.
It is increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the management of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy was led, when colleagues earlier thought that I shared many political positions with all of a sudden beginning to expect me to take an U-turn and stand in the way I had never previously agreed on, whether the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak in public – and it has nothing to say what I say – I receive a lot of bad messages on social media that require me to resign, condemn central politics and tell me that I shouldn't be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that discriminates against sex and racist comments every day, but they never let themselves get into trouble.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross discrimination has been normalized.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the working party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change in the election rules is making the party narrower.
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise your voice so much because it will "do everything better".
But that is not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom at the public school I went on was literally finished, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never concealed my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that because the country breeds our way towards a Brexit that would harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to commitment or political incompetence will prevent me from doing what I think best will safeguard their interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unscrupulous Ayr Rises to Tops
Two late trials have changed the outcome a little bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this fantastic entertaining Tennant's Premiership campaign.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only ones unsealed by the ten.
In the end it was as much their superior defence as their ability to use the opportunities they had given to the home team to go off with the winner, and the coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
"We have been challenged in our struggles so far and still unabated, so I must be pleased with that," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better off using the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's experiment for 14 minutes, with target park from Frazier Climo ga Ayr management, but a yellow card to Scotland's master of Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, lot Melrose balanced the position, and Jason Baggot performed an effort without target park.
The climate strengthened Ayr's leadership with a criminal park before he, just before the break, scored and targeted a solo attempt to change his position to 17-5 at break.
But Melrose started the second half hard, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, with target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
There was a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruarid Knott, which was carried out on bars, and from the restart Ayr increased the management even more oath a trial by Stafford McDowell, with target park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it to have an extra man on the track to the fullest with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team however came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have covered the climate when he did not have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the entrance behind the brilliant Ayr-mauule.
Climo performed a target park, as he did again almost entirely from restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanges Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt of the team.
The game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game Star Ford Kieran is on its way into the service industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as the director of a restaurant company with a donation.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, for which he writes manuals and plays together with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
Duen has announced that the next ninth season will be the end of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the Director of Operational Morn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "living restaurant industry".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a land without a coastline, hopes that the right will open the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a rowing deck of marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicacas to Amazon are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The entire country of Bolivia has still been fresh in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s, and the country lengthens after once again could sail on the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for several decades, pending a hearing from the International Court of Justice on 1 October following five years' discussion.
«Bolivia has the driving force, the Community spirit and peace of mind, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the knowledge of the International Court of Justice on a large screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its knowledge in favour of Bolivia's claim that Chile, after several decades of sporadic negotiations, is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also put a lot of emphasis on Monday's knowledge.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will soon take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had.
The United Nations body, as its members in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give up Chilean land areas and has stipulated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
That knowledge from the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the last arguments were heard that the case was ‘not complicated’, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have actually done worse things.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been solved by the current Bolivian administration’, Zárate said.
She believes that Morale's antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's ruling was unusually rapid.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will give ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile’ and the possibility to ‘stop a 139-year disagreement for both parties’.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – has used the maritime situation as a political shield.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific’, he added.
«The knowledge is a reason to see what we must do to overcome the past.»
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never weaken its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust American authorities.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with their promises at a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments will appear at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo to be ready to launch the hardened nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ‘desire dream’ to continue sanctions and American resistance against is a declaration that will ever force North Korea into knees.
The American authorities are skeptical about accepting the declaration without first introducing significant decommissioning measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want another meeting.
But there is great doubt as to whether Pyongyang really has plans to let go of an arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo has plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mote shows in Paris reveal the latest within huge headgear, which is on its way to a dress shop near you
If you want to have any big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't need to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne produced a selection of rare, over-dimensional headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motels on the moteuka in Paris.
Very unpractice haters have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most spectacular plague was an exaggerated beige had painted with a springlike wide brake as the heads of the models were drowned.
Other super-dimensional accessories included jewelryed watermelons, a magic hat or even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also took off a selection of distinctive masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had repeated lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation remembers diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in the cake.
And if you're out after even bigger mote accessories, then you're lucky.
Stylish experts predict that the huge hats may be on their way to a dress shop near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-metre-wide brake that has been seen on all and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractice hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag of straw that is almost as big as the bathing suit model wearing it.
The orange raffia bag, which is bordered with raffia fries and completed with a white rail handle, was the most striking creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Moteuka in Paris.
Kendistylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such an impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for super-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s fresh schools are still demonstrating academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with some one year’s excellent exam results, supported by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free Schools Council), have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Fresh schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you speak to a man in a language he understands when the words are his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, then the words of his heart shall come to him."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only stay in English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the year's exam, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest percentages of survival from fresh schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the exam character A.
The data, obtained from 74 member schools of the Council of State, showed that 72 per cent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that fresh schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill for children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as professional choice are now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the mind of fresh schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons for job vacancies were attributed to lack of language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
Each time more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Communication directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouTube survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and in French the only language was a two-digit number (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Learning more languages, in particular those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered the most valuable for Britain on the way towards 2020, e.g. Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a selection of languages to choose between in fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is still crucial to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in the teaching.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as ‘international communication capacity’.
Fresh schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakes for the first time.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the Sunday's opening fight against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he has to play is still not determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game performance plan.
"I don't need racers at this stage of my career," he answered.
Time for the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
The President launches a number of elections tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump during the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected highest-ranking candidate is pending, Trump aims to obtain support for the upcoming elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when the voters go to the polling hours in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia folk meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia on the network below via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the weekly hearings for the highest-ranking board of Kavanaugh, who is charged with sexual abuse.
The main objective of all these meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that during the next few weeks, these five popular meetings aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters, trying to protect and extend the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are moving towards a travelling campaign season," Reuters was told by a campaign speaker for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's folk meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh press, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate d.a., Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a promise of the goals,” said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows spirit to maintain faith as they enter the single game on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions Saturday afternoon fursomes may have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The moment's swinging pendulum is a fully educated sport concept, but nevertheless some players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the moment is now?
"They run with six points and now it's four, so we'll probably carry it with us as a moment," said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they run with four points and it's 12 to play again.
But as Spieth says the Americans feel that they have got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration screams got higher after each time as his round continued, and fell to a decisive pitch to lift the match to undecided when he and Thomas lay under two after two.
His putting, which won them the 15th match, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is useless.
"We really just have to put all the knots on and focus on our own match," said Spieth.
That's all these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cups' great success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious couple have four of them and don't make a mistake.
«Moliwood» was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to move both to and from the living population make it clear that they are the biggest competitors of Sunday, and there are no other players in the audience nor will they see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Anyway, both at once, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson picked up easily with Sergio Garcia, the fourballs hero of the morning, when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes lay the Spanish and Swedish so far on demand that they had no chance to take back the momentum.
But on Sunday, there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely at because of the collaboration between the couples, the advice they give to each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn for a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session has also shown that Team USA has the strength of each individual, especially in the USA, has missed.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will take a strong lead at the start of Ryder Cups the last day, after completing Sunday's fourballs and foursomes games with 10-6 leadership towards the USA.
The brilliant Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, struggling to maintain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't get back any of the moves.
Jim Fury's page has to get eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoker to have scored four in a row, and he and Molinari – who together got the nickname Molliwood after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have scored four from their first four matches in Ryder Cups history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they co-operated relentlessly to beat down Woods and the American smoker Bryson Dechambeau with even more impressive 5-4-4.
Woods, who held through two games on Saturday, shined into the guts, but has now lost 19 of its 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who spent the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2+1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this hot day with a light breeze south-west of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won more than three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 2+1 match over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Paulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cups' history has a team clear to get into after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need Fury's side to get undecided to keep the trophy.
But having been the next best for two days doesn't seem like they'll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will "no way" join side by side without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the mistrust against the United States and that the country would in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual general meeting that North Korea has implemented ‘significant welfare measures’ during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembly the nuclear test area and by not spreading nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any similar response from the USA," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not, in any case, unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear decommissioning, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear decommissioning completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a United States President and a North Korean leader, where Kim was promised to work against the "nuclear destruction of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War which took place from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce severe international sanctions against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and lifts the pressure through sanctions to achieve its target by force and even by ‘declaration of the end of the war’’, according to Ri.
"Trusting that sanctions can force us in the knee is a wish dream for people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions create further losses.»
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party to this case was South Korea, not the United States, the nuclear weapons of Korea would not have been as locked as it is.’
However, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from that of the four-year-old, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the United States with North Korea missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rockettman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood up in front of the United Nations and shocked Kim to be brave enough to take the steps of disarmament, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is Atomic Waste.
On Wednesday Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said that “It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: ‘The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced strongly and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear decommissioning.’
The Security Council has unanimously increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to penalise the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and said after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after the charge of North Korea to have come with "walking demands".
North Korea committed itself at a meeting with Moon this month to land a missile area and a nuclear weapons plant if the United States did ‘equivalent’.
He said Kim had said that these ‘corresponding measures’ he wanted, were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise Washington's relationship.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by covering the growing unculture by sneaking through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the best university in the world often had no clue how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the effect sleep deprivation has on learning.
"After the talk a girl came to me and said, 'Why hasn't anyone said this before?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which begins this year, explains to the students how important it is with good sleep habits in order to perform academically and sportingly, and to the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffer from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons allows participants to think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the students’ behaviour immediately.
But we think they have the right to know about this, in the same way that you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a certain pride in being able to puke all night, he said, and let modern technology and the still increasing pressure on the students led to an increasing shortage of sleep.
Good sleep should be the students’ ‘secret weapon’ against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weighing, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes of the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put on an alarm for when they should behave as well as for when they should stand up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Measurement of Menga turns out Gerrard's men
Rangers led a long enough escape when Dolly Menga's goal hit Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to win its first victory since February 4–1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss of 18 matches as manager and left behind his eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiership Leaders Hearts.
Slap to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers were never able to compensate.
Rangers are now falling in sixth place, while Livingston is climbing up to third and behind Hibernian on target differences.
There may be more trouble in yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for head injury after an object was thrown from the outside public.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, which ran past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went to the same Livi 11 who took a score from Heart's last week, and he would have been happy to see how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers had perhaps the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the match when Menga's first fit sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player lost the chance.
A far-off park of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if their game had fallen more on hope than on the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have a penal park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless were collapsing, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first round, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly didn't get any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a bad kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Life's opening in 34 minutes may have been against the move of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacob's.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player gave immediate results when the player sent him to Morelos, but Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, by getting Lithgow and Halkett caught up long dance after long dance.
Holt's side could have pulled the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacob's before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton had probably a late claim to a penal park while he was at the port in conflict with Jacobs, but again he saw Thomson away.
Almanac: Finder's Counter
And now a side of the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the gear counter.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and has also become part of the popular culture through the film ‘Bells of Coronado’ from 1950, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals emits.»
Evans: "Let's say it makes noise now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the invention he gave his name, lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
Cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancer forms and then injected into the patient again
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that her ovary cancer suffered from vanishing for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 «drives growth of different types of cancer», including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, where immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to address cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with strong defense from Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was shot in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a famous performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would hold elections in 2020.
After having performed his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, brought a Make America Great Again-hatt, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I had moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made a fool of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee of the charges of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, it was uploaded by West in social media by comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the public that he had heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headaches.
‘The mobbed me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
The mobbeth me!
And then they said that I don't understand what reality is," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want me to understand what the reality is?" he said, and said that he would "take on me the Superman cap, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try love.»
His comments were bent at least twice, and the employees who worked on SNL so smoothly reported Variety, where a member of staff said: «The whole studio was dead».
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song «I Love It» dressed as a Perrier-water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: «To one of our bravest: THAN YOU MASSENE.»
But talkshower Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
«But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his «art») which I believe is growing and asking out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's us, too," she added.
Before the show announced the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "the world formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and now follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rappercollege Snoop Dog has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, it is the deceased musical Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extends to "gifty masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticised the stereotype of machohelten and says such roles in movies often get young men to believe they have to be brave to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something went wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married to Game of Thrones-College Rose Leslie, also 31 years, agreed that he was very busy with the theme.
"I'm quite worried about it right now – where did it go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we dealt with men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes TV can have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculine roles.
He continued: "What is born into it, and what is born into it?
What's spread on TV and on the street, what makes young guys feel that they have to grow right this way by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time – how can we change it?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any continuation or successor of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is «complete with battlegrounds and horses».
From November, Kit will play the main role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a Ranger.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
Coupled married in June 2018 at the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been hit in the country, says the Health Representative.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted via sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in the Yunnan province.
For years, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men after each marriage to women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection from sex in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to cooperate with leaked data on republican senators, mergers of «dangerous lies» and «conspiracy theories»
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, refused on Saturday to accuse members of her staff of posting the personal data to three republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawyers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insured by the claims was submitted by ultraconservative commentators and web pages.
«T lying, lying and more reprehensible lies» said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the charges of assault against the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had expelled Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was tracked to the Waters' office and disclosed information about a member of the Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unwarranted charge is completely incorrect and a regular lie’ continued Waters.
«The members of my staff - who have received their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these regular and false charges - had absolutely no responsibility for the leaking of this information.
This unwarranted charge is completely incorrect and a regular lie.’
Waters' opinion was quickly criticised online, among others by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This threat is aggressive,’ Fleischer wrote.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They can't defend themselves.
They must not question the accused's motives.
They have to act quietly and understand.’
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of acting aggressively during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the middle of the elections, also air his thoughts on Twitter.
«Stort – if it is true, he tweeted.
In her opinion, Waters said that her office had warned her "relevant authorities and the police about these false charges".
«We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed», she continued «and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff».
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – bloodthirsty Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has now become a tradition to watch Brexit's events in all new films with a British moment and it seems to be current for this re-resurrection of the parody French Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will Sarcastically self-insatisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation's new export goods?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with its blushing eyes and the rubber face have been renewed his license to rot it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English cinema audiences.
He's, of course, the stupid secret agent who despite his charismatic James Bond ambitions is a mix of Clouseau, a guy Mr Bean, and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the musical entry with the fire theme during the opening ceremony at OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the longest forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
It's one and the other great moment in the last Johnny English era.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor leaves cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes right, but the humor feels quite bloodthirsty and strangely excessive, especially now that the «serious» brand items such as 007 and Mission Nei willingly have comedy entries.
The humor seems to be more directed towards children than adults, and for me Johnny English's fads aren't as inventive and eating as the silent film eyes of Mr. Bean.
The current premier is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web networks of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the contempt of the guard - a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a minister of state, a pumpus and a disabled figure who is already undergoing a complete crisis of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this as well-Teresa-May role, but the manual does not give her much to work with.
Her consultants inform her that since each active spy has been discovered, she must pick up some of the pensioners.
And that means the cloned Johnny English, who now teaches at a snobbed establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence, there are some kind of sequences here when English offers a rock academy for spying.
English is taken back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, afflicted helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, apart from a sub-commandant, a hysterical superclass lady where Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So Batman and Robin's style of rotting everything up on the queen's orders is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's fantastic woman fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is being led by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the Lumish Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their trip with a puzzling side spring: dressed as servants they put the guy on a charming French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board in Volta luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to become known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but still so loving and noisy it's so much to remember about children's TV with all the stuff.
Quite moderate, everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think but that the British film industry can give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour advises that they plan to let the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has to consider a radical plan that will give the British a four-day work week – but be paid for five.
The Party would clearly see that business leaders should use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra day of the week free.
This will result in the employees getting a three-day weekend, while they get the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the Party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
Trade unions support the four-day shift so that workers can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day auction is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pendulum fluctuate for the benefit of the workers, in addition to its overall industrial strategy.’
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day weekend in the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson for Labour said: "A four-day weekend is not the party's policy, and is not something that is assessed by the party."
Financial Speaker for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from ‘faceless directors’ and ‘profiters’ of public service providers.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders of water companies are at risk of not getting the full shareholding because a Labour Government may ‘deduction’ from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company boards and set up an employee fund to transfer 10 % of equity to private sector companies to the employees, who may receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has put forward a final vote on his nomination to the highest right with at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's findings could have some Republican senators changed their views.
In an interview that was sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open about it than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, firm, firm.”
However, Graham's voice seems to be stuck in stone.
“I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it must be an observational finding,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing:
‘And none of them could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to act and an equally impressive mission; eradicate world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will have thousands of people streaming to the great plenary in Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real objective of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group hoping to combat poverty by having more people actively work against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or «actions», such as voluntary work, send e-mails to a world leader, take a telephone or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for changes, or just a case of so-called "clickivism" -- that people feel a great contribution by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says they have registered more than 19 million «actions» from their supporters since 2011, with a range of different objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will improve the situation for more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements resulting from their shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and founders based in the United Kingdom who will ‘help children to exploit their full potential’, and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice by undermining a footnote in history," said Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 shares in the United Kingdom in order to obtain better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, ‘What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?’
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road – amongst us we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-partiety movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of the artists who will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman on the occasion of this year's event in New York.
The United States may use the Navy as a “blocked” to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister of the Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ because to the marine to prevent Russian energy when the markets, among other things in the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular when operating at the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy exactly as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flag of Europe," he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means of dealing with this.
‘The United States has the opportunity to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy does not reach the market’, he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that profiles itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noticed that they are far from equal.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less exploiting and replacing fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The opinions came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and they want to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
The members of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project the North European pipeline 2, which according to Trump made Berlin ‘capture’ in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's glamorous opposition to the project is solely motivated by economic reasons and is an example of regular competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s industry leader organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have serious problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” on his presidential candidacy for 2020, Senator of Massachusetts says
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” whether she would stand as the presidential candidate after the elections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would keep quiet.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the shocked government, and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether I should become a presidential candidate.’
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he was "bringing the country in the wrong direction".
“I’m completely worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday tweet, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI review before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own electors do not believe that she should be silent in 2020.
58% of the ‘probable’ voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be silent, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The opinion measure showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other highly-profiled democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidate in 2020 are among others vis-à-vis President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The bite said he would officially decide by January," reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence incident Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have with him," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest «the elephant in the room» and said about the son and other war veterans: «They come home a little changed, they come home the shepherd, they come home and wonder if this is the respect their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country».
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the aim of violence at a woman's home, silenced with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was engaged, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the police in Wasilla.
18 countries and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eight States and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that rejects asylum for victims fleeing from return or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from amicius curiae (friend of the law) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the petitioner in Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner "and his violent son-in-law" abused her, but authorities in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations with cross-cutting problems of repetition and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Immigration Court of Appeal which gave undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence the right to apply for asylum.
State lawyer Karl Racine in the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is missing from many decades by state, federal and international law".
«Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle» said the guidance of amicatus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that denied immigrants access is damaging the American economy and says that it is highly likely that they will become more founded and "help with the necessary labour force".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and return in June.
‘Asyl is available to those leaving the country due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view’, the June 11th session said about the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – the deaths doubled in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It was very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she comforts her feverish son at an evacuation center in the most shocking city of Palu.
«All the time you see ambulances getting lost.
Clean water is missing.’
It was possible to see residents who came to damaged homes and easily through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had strength 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes as he repeats how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves safely.
I was glued by the wall that crawled together, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of ‘tracing’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper launched a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that portrayed the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China Beijing accused the US of using American press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the China Daily Annex paid to join the Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to join the American Congress elections on 6 November, a accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to influence the US election marked a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to press China, said US officials according to Reuters.
It is quite normal for foreign authorities to use advertisements to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds with new tariffs on each other's imports.
China's criminal law early in the trade war was to hit export companies in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's republican party, report to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former multi-year governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China now steps up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
‘By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities take advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,’ Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast – at the aviskiosque on the street here in Beijing you don’t find many divergent opinions and can’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: ‘One of China’s biggest newspapers rejected the offer to publish’ his article, even though he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare women's electors before the Kavanaugh faedesen elections, warn analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the highest-right candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several charges of sexual abuse directed against themselves, analysts warn that they will receive a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
Feelings about this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given evidence that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse Universities Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI review in the last seconds would be enough to calm down his electors.
"Women will not forget yesterday's events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang "November is coming!" while they demonstrated in the Senate proceedings when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness's statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
«Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women's insecure electors in the suburbs and younger electors between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they deny the President.”
Even before Ford’s public witness, who gave a detailed description of the charges of sexual abuse against the highest-right candidate, analysts thought that there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced the appointment.
"This has become a blessed root for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not only about the Committee’s vote or the final approval, or about Kavanaugh being put in place – it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,’ said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over whom they should believe in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouTube shows that 41% of the respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38 % said that they were quite or fully convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under their testimony, while only 30 % said the same about Ford.
After the Flake game, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had committed himself to her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the highest-right candidate exposed her genitals to her while they were at the party during the study at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legacy project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees' open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee saw the objective as ‘world domination’.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
«It is a historic moment».
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own «personal data storage online» or a POD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique with the online personal data storage is that it is completely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company will have resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of contracted developers to work with the project and a team of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which would make their business models completely rescinded overnight.
‘We do not ask for their permission’.

Bernard Water: Celebration of the Victoria Cross recipient from the 1st World War
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victorian Cross during World War I as a rival was celebrated in his home town after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Water was awarded the certificate of honor on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he was awarded the highest British military designation.
A monument was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Water, said it was a "fine symbol" in that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award-winning taste.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water battalion led over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under strong protection from field cannons and masks”.
Later he turned towards the shooting line and led the line "with big towards" ahead before storming a field cannon by himself and blowing out three of the departments.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live to, but something that makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid down a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Water said he “felt very pleased to play a part in the parade” and added: “The bravery of a real is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people”.
MMA supporters were up all night to watch the combat sports program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Make sure you stay up all night to see the densely packed Bellator 206, just to find out you don't get to see the main fight.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom sat down to wave as the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Someone was less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to see the battle.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as "a sort of sick joke".
‘It is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 so they could be transferred to the children’s programme,’ said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
"Peppa gray, yes!"
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the viewers in Great Britain in the future.
"I think we can find out about it for the purpose of the fight," said Coker.
“But there are six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe it or not-- when we put it over, there were many messages going over and over again, and they weren't exactly the friendly sort of thing.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five matches – as we usually send – and we tried to extend far to the trailers, but tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic actor Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before in high school he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the homophiles to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned with winning OL.
The regular programmer of the traditional rich programme, Kirsty Young, shall be away for a few months due to illness.
Daley emerged as a little off the Lavernes' first mission and said he felt “less worth” than everyone else he grew up with “because it was not socially acceptable to equal both boys and girls”.
He said, "To this day, these feelings are of being inferior and different who have been the real motivation and have the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze winner in OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in the Year's College in Australia to appeal for several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he is lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times World Master said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was, yesterday, but he said the age difference had never been any problem.
"When you're going through so much in such a young age"--he took part in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me yesterday, everything turned out that I just had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in OL.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about whether they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year after Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to step in front of a home-public under OL, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot to him in the run before OL and which still gives him gait.
Desert Island Discs goes on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Formswake Mickelson took out the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup camp, but he has to get in shape if it's not gonna be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the impressive 12th time binium, was placed on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk before the fourball and foursome champions.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five times the major winner divides the day between being healers and working with his game on the rank in hopes of fixing what's cutting.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the top of the career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National track, where the long rough area still penalizes wild blows.
And if the path itself is not scary enough, meets Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, the British Open-Master Francesco Molinari himself, who has met with the new beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the fights their week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses his trust in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready next day," said Furyk.
«He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has brought so much to these laws earlier, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup champions on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven unsolved, but Furyk said his participation brought some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny and he likes to drive the gym with others. He's a nice guy to have in the storage room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership will soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European Team Captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership at the entrance of the last day's single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama fight, where a side led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the square to itself the victory with the least possible margin, 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
“You still remember that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only if we did,” said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Come out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have got the points on the table.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjørn is very pleased with how his players have proved to be on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performance that's in the center, and it's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer will be tested to the full.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to provide better individually than they did as partners.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the big rounds the last day. He was on the winning team at Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe performed the "miracle at Medina".
I remember every damn word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had been here with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 major battles tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, as we experienced at Brooklyn, as we saw at Medina.
When the moment begins to go in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle battles.
We'll arrange our setup then and send out the people in the way we feel about it.
Thomas has had the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy at the top, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the line.
“I’m betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warships delayed once again
Germany's latest cargo would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen before the next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of ‘Reinland-Pfalz’, the leader of the entirely new freighters of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted a military speaker.
The vessel would have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007, will replace the old cargoes of the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they should be equipped with a strong cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to use the latest freight for up to two years away from home.
Recent delays, however, mean that the advanced warships – they were told to strengthen Germany at sea – will already be delayed before they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 fleet created headlines yesterday, when German marine officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss farm in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important ‘software and hardware defects’ that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older freighters of the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge balance, which reduces performance and restricts the ability of the mariner to make future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Reinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price gap on the whole project – including human training – has begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new freight are of particular importance in the light of fresh warnings that German marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's Defence Committee, confirmed that the Navy is actually ‘empty for usable ships’.
The officer said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were overrun, but there was no new ship.
He regrets that none of the cargoes in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Marine.
National Trust stealers on the secret life of flag mice
New research carried out by a country property in the Highland of Scotland shall determine how flag mouse uses the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common flag and dvergflaggermus as well as well as brown-legged and water-flaggermus at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be located at important locations around the property to track flag musculoskeletal activity during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts' audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flag shells and the species that do what.
Then there will be a habitat map and a report to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will discover which areas of habitat are most important to the flag mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the installation of pasture grounds and how best to take care of the forest of flag mice and other associated species.
The flag musc population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has suffered considerably over the past few centuries.
They are threatened by construction and construction that affects young people's places and habitat constraints.
Windmills and lighting may also constitute a risk, as well as flue paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as attacks from household taxes.
Flaggermus is not actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than for their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced eco-location to find insects and obstacles on the way when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag mouse very seriously.
They have 10 skilled experts who regularly carry out studies, surveying of juvenile sites and in the field of rescue.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own flag museum reserve at Thrave's property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag museums.
Property Manager David Thompson says that property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a perfect area for flag flies," he says.
«We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But that's still a lot we don't know about flag mice, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of mapping the flag mice before maintenance is carried out on a property since the unpredictable destruction of a single juvenile place may kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps investigate an entire local population.
The flag mouse is protected, and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them or disturb them or destroy their youth places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help with the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mice, and for many species we simply don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of violence while lawyers are seeking German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the charges of violence against himself as “false news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to investigate the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375 000 later for keeping close to the event," Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33 years old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times the Golden Ball wins into the camera.
‘They want to be famous by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm good," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to investigate Der Spiegel because of the claims they have called ‘an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will claim compensation for “demnification damage to an extent equivalent to the degree of severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of the privacy in recent years”.
The alleged event will have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have gone back to the footballer's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was ‘99 % a good person’ who was betrayed by the ‘one percent’.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that images of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they found a settlement outside the court because she was "saved for revenge" and was also concerned about "being publicly hanged".
The 34th year she says she's now trying to make a comparison because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged breach, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK «will make sure forever» to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom ‘will provide for forever’ if they lose their status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of a delayed border crossing of any Brexit without an agreement could mean less work.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will experience, in my view, that production at our factory stops," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how trade across borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says they'll close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what car manufacturers say is a supply chain risk for any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as needed’ and it comes every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit’s future EU-connection plan is ‘precisely set up to avoid such checks at the border’.
"We need a deal, and we want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only able to enjoy success right now, but taking this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that increased costs in the long term would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and after each loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never return."
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be exposed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with the Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be “exposed for a week” while the fight around the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Trump and Russia and possible obstruction of the presidential exercise.
The issue of Trump will be dismissed by the Minister of Justice or not, and thus threatening Mueller's independence, has for many months been tingled up during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to leave voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer to let go" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was held to prevent him from collapsing with the Senate's judicial committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI review of charges against Kavanaugh, which further put forward a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I understood it could be a week off because of everything that happens with the highest right.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists would argue that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Softwared Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the opposition of TV reporters to ‘self-sufficiency’, although she added: ‘I do not disagree that they are self-godly’.
Then she indicated that the contact between Trump and the press would become more frequent.
‘The President raises more questions than any previous president,’ she said and added without giving evidence: ‘We have seen the figures’.
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it done often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open demonstrations or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause when he ran a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS (State Health Service) to express its gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for a residence and employment permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue have taken place in the summer and are expected to land on a solution to the harvest.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much I value the effort of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and expertise that enhances and improves the health service to the best of our patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely their home and we hope that you will be here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defence Player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee States' chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
“He came out on the side line and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they placed him on a bar and took him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated by the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘not yet available information on the type/extent of the damage’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five rounds on Saturday before he finished the match, which gives a total of 18 rounds for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralise the success of Corby's plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be levied from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts in the Department of Finance expect it to increase up to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's plan to attract young voters with a commitment to offer more reasonable housing and a framework for high-income groups.
The increase in document fees will be imposed on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The profit – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on housing number two and rental housing purchases – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to amount to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of the newly built property in London is purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which raises prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet within the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ‘inflation cities’ because of the many foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
The new policy will only come weeks after Boris Johnson came up with proposals for a reduction in the document fee to help several young people to own their own home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May refuse allowances on reasonable housing to solve Britain's 's shameful housing policy'.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an insightful series of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unjustified projects.
He also wants to give the municipal authorities greater power to build new dwellings.
May said: "Yesterday, I said that I would spend my time as a minister of state to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our collapsed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy as it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard-working British citizens.
Too many people have the dream of owning their own home too far away, and the worthless situation of the homeless.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's chief, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager before or since.
The 42-year-old Scotch enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after having led St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
«But I was often with my father and looked Scotland at the Hampden as a child, and it is always something that pulls me back.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club.’
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief said he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously denied approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Success for me at the moment will be measured if I can get the club back in Premier League’.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they are among the desirable Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself to be successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to return from depression to third division and helped St. Mirren from the edge of depression to win the title of the championship next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real difference," he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds nice since I did it well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are many things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it with stress and pressure at work, but management feels perfectly right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. It feels like the most comfortable I have known throughout my adult life.”
You can hear the entire interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing the study
The summer's heat wave has strengthened Britain's hard-pressed pubs' income, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase in turnover of 2,7 % in July – while the revenues for restaurants fall 4,8 %, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a company consultant for CGA, who reviewed the figures, said: “Continuing the solar system and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup, July followed a similar pattern as last month of June, when the pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in restaurant sales in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had a far better result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than that restaurant went down.
Pubs with food-serving also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the restaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars increased turnover by 6,6 % that month, with food service decreased by 3 %’.
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social arrangements are still the main factors in the market market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are still having difficulty and a 4,8 % year-on-year turnover will be particularly painful at the top of the current cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-servicing companies, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a prolonged breathing room.»
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in rolling of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry turnover controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents
One of the five children – some only 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media that they hide for parents and teachers, showing research
A study of 20 000 youth school students discovered “Fake Insta” pages.
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of students said they have a «main account» they show their parents.
One of the five children – some are only 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden for adults.
A survey of 20 000 young school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to picture sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent ‘main account’ that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "violently rape me".
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors’ Conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is scary that so many young people are being tempted to set up websites where parents and teachers cannot find them”.
Elid Doyle will be the voice of the peacekeepers on the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board and has a non-executive role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated peacekeepers, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilhid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide peacekeeping environment, and we are sure that peacekeepers in Scotland will enjoy getting her into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am excited to act as a voice for peacekeepers, and I hope I have much to contribute to guide the sport in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters under OL in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold. She is now a firm BBC expert, and after receiving a transient ischemic attack she was unable to go.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would show me whether I would be returned and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm all right again and I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing flexicurity exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows divides the opinion online
A breast pump company has split the opinion online with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world’s first soundless breast pump to be carried close to the body’, Elvie, the technology-based consumer product company, a fresh and flourishing, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a playful full of tall and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t understand it, this isn’t jury, it’s my dolls”.
Coret continues: "Spring it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it's the ‘graciousness’ in the dairy industry.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," it was one that wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets a nice place in a amme-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: «Probably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: ‘For a failed ad’.
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little spree, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genius product," it was one that wrote.
Another commented: ‘This is a funny ad addressed to mothers as pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘dogs’.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the women discover that they've all danced with the discrete pump in the b's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the awareness that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cats.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and gets a nice place in a amme-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cows, we wanted to put searchlights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while we show in a entertaining and recognizable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a magic mom appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent at the Texas border in secret
The number of migrant children detained has remained stable even though the monthly cross-border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the tough rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most support players themselves have been undocumented immigrants and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of being in the country by stepping forward and demanding a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the immigration and customs authorities, testified to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who were seeking to be supporters of individual minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not previously have a criminal roll sheet.
‘Approximately 80 % of persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people," says Albence.
Officers are trying to handle children more quickly and introduce new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to receiving workers.
Many will be produced through videoconferencing instead of meeting personally to conduct their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those assessed as unwarranted asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or rescue attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger plant such as Tornillo, where children who wear more easily are translated because of the size of the plant.
They added that moving children to the tentacle without getting enough time to prepare emotionally or with friends can strengthen the traumas many are already experiencing.
Syria requests US, French and Turkish ‘occupational powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also acting as Minister of State, said that foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian soil under cover of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated afterwards’.
‘They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally’ he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the move.
He said that Damascus will continue to " conduct this holy struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has around 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counselling of Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-lorded country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘some Western countries’ of ‘split irrational refugees’ which make the refugees stay away.
"We have approached the international community and humanitarian organisations to arrange for these returns," he said.
They are policing what is actually a purely humanitarian situation."
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria before a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defense of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including soldiers from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, who would be ‘destroyed’.
UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to call to the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem made conditions for the participation of the Syrian authorities in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the present basic law’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump wants to win a period
After that logic, Trump would have won a reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators probably hope, the rule of law and scandals would end the presidency before that time.
In what would be, of course, "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!"
There's no sign of sighting right now.
Since 2014, the best transmission time numbers have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC «The Rachel Maddow Show» has peaked the cable numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with big news items.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, programmer of the ABC "Designed Survivors" drama, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedian and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club», has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions that take place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and health to the global economy.
The output is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you extend yourself far to be an informed person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of the "deep in the background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with strut spring worth $15,000 ("a plague spilt with hybrids", said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
“Some of what he does to make it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, the daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars”, about Trump’s varied role crew and daily shift on the platform (a mess with NFL, Shamrose Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be hanging out.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 °C and the sun outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he stayed in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He could not break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to meet the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the highest right in the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we put all the language programs in old days and people said that this is the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the regular intervals of the House of Representatives
There is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experienced a stream of money after a conversion of a congressional district that ended up fighting over the same seat by two seated representatives.
This recently reoccupied urban district in Pittsburgh is with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplemental election last spring.
Lamb is facing another seated representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is largely covering the new 17th district.
The map was re-drawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were a fundamentally controversial manipulation of the electoral circles in the favour of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign financing between the largest party funding groups, DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a close follow-up election for Pennsylvania 18th district to the Congress in March last year.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little leadership.
USA evaluated criminal measures against El Salvador for support to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama even to the partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the Department, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalty measures were assessed only against El Salvador, which received estimated US aid of $140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalty measures, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials were exposed to a summit conference that focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar meeting last year that was assessed as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now framed to speak at the conference, which is now planned in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration adding the assembly, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new bold messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson at the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next pointer in the box may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal practice, which is now very solid evidence for in public documents.
Mueller is also likely to expand the review of whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering with our elections.
If the congress were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of preparations to meet the electors again and perhaps at the end of a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's case is inevitable – nor for his opponents in Europe.
There must be a choice by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938 German officers stood ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years with the bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or blocked.
The Americans are facing several of these fluctuations now.
What will we do if Trump kicks the Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tough mood all the time since this paper announced that he proposed secret hearings yesterday by the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is wrong.
«How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is granted the highest right in the face of credible charges of aggression and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote under the auspices of a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we do not consist of those tests, democracy will be faced with a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the experience I got in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath light on the table with the crochet cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I let myself be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimism before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in confidence that they will win over the Austrians after the impressive unsolved fight in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A broken blocked midway play by Graham Dorrans in making his first performance for the season in the unsolved 2-2 fight against Villareal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villareal is a good team," said the 31st.
"We went into the game and thought we could get something and got us one point.
Maybe we could have had nothing in the end, but it was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
It's probably a big night in Europe on Thursday.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with home-public in my back I am sure we can stand up and get a positive result.
The four years were absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but it has a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys choose; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand now, put the past season behind us and get it over with."
Women lose their nightly sleep because of fear of retirement
Although the participants in the study had a clear explanation of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationalwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to make that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, wise president of the National Life Insurance Business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not say what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the counsellor and the family where and how care should be given, such choices may be of great importance in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clear the legal problems at the same time.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes if you should be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Think that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details in a list so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
«What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place.’

Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the deaths are expected to rise.
The communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu, which is located close to the episthetic of the earthquake of 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donghala is a regent that extends over 300 km with a coastline in the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regent, an administrative region under the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the central province of Sulawesis economy, in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Emergency Administration.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Fire in the Pacific Sea and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 hit south on Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 struck one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that razed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake struck the Pide Jaya Regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while humans were reminded of the reigns of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquake hits Indonesia’s tourist Lombo and kills more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested after charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, silenced with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska del state police.
According to the police report, he must have received the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged violation.
Palin will be imprisoned in Mat-Su prison and detained for an uncertain debt worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, when he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he responded to the guilty issue, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three offences of Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $200.
It's not the first time it's been set up against Palin.
In December 2017 he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged attack.
The case will be taken to Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was targeted for domestic violence, silenced with the report on domestic violence and to hold a weapon while he was pregnant in connection with the incident.
His boyfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by vet groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behaviour to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: more than a hundred deaths
At least 384 people are killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck at the center of Sulawesi, northeastern Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami swept across the beach.
Federal Prosecution Authorities rarely apply for death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal Prosecution Authorities in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist rapist in New York who killed eight people – a rare penalty that has not been practised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he took down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘intensely’ and caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury launched the 22-point statement, including eight killings in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a purpose for the violence and overthrow of the vehicle.
The attack demanded "significant planning and purpose", said the actor, who described how Saipov performed it as "healing, cruel and spoiled".
‘Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, damage to property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci’, states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the South District of New York led to a death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York, in 1953, it was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were sentenced for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after having seen ISIS videos on the phone, according to the purpose.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung on the hospital room, the police said.
He did not declare himself guilty after the call of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the public-appointed defenders of Saipov, said that they were "evidently disappointed" over the decision of the prosecution authority.
“We believe that the decision to apply for a death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only extend the traumas of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecution authorities not to apply for a death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the armies of the people" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians would get the "smooth pressure" from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be held responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom «ville has been eradicated» now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply fragmented ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in an own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitees, Remainers and the EU.
The supporters insisted that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlog – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "kaos".
Bone told the Solihull Demonstrators that he wanted to reject the Brexit Plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
When explaining his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied claims that the referendum had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is a complete mistake’.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I say quite simply: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit Plan is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our activists, who are actually those who cross the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening.’
In a direct message to May, she added: «Ministers of State keep their jobs when they keep their promises».
Farage said that policymakers would be "sensitive to the pressure" if they were to betray the decision taken by the referendum in 2016.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and those politicians," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize people's armies in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-government, proud Great Britain."
In the marched Remainers through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis hired the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland’, he added.
«It is a complete grandfather.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren takes seriously his position as President's Candidate
USA Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider seriously as a presidential candidate” after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the future during a summit in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elections in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was the visa officer of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to speculation about whether she's going to stand up to Trump in 2020.
The arrangement Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the advisory format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to sit down as a presidential candidate.
Warren replied that it is time that “women come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top”.
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode as a dead LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11.00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died afterwards as a result of it,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde grabbed in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene and had a gun with him.
Simpson was arrested without arrest and put in custody by the politicians of East Baton Rouge Paris.
Sims was a two-metre high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is looking at the title of the world master after orders of steel give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valteri Botta's qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable orders would play a major role in the course.
From pole got Bottas a good start and fed almost Hamilton of the track while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the deposit first and lot Hamilton continued to run in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels that made the Ferrari-led reluctant lot inside to be free after a double pass to defend himself in a third turn.
Max Versteppen started from the back row of the field and entered as no. seven at the end of the first round of his 21-year-old.
Then he led most of the course as he lay on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overman Kimi Raikkonen who lay as number four.
He finally came within the 44th round deposit, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good top," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump accused Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her detention that she did not play the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are "insane, false and abusive".
“The only thing that could happen and the pleasant thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are bad and bad and fall and speak abusively,” he said.
"When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I have not done it».»
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you play?
Do you remember her answer... you played the document-- "Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not played».»
Hey, wait a minute.
We played... no, we didn't play," he added, imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused to let the leak come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't play her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
«She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked for».
But her refusal was not taken up kindly by the president, who, during the party event Saturday night, commented: "I have to tell you one thing; it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the highest-right candidate, who has been charged with three women's sexual abuse, the President indicated that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw the power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome in order to gain power and control," said the president in Mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the Friday's Elite League losing against Belfast Giants by winning the return campaign 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got a two-way lead early by shooting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the winner.
It was the third Elite League lost for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford released the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned home to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt made up for Cownies' compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced once again with a prestigious goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen to give Dundee leadership for the first time during the fight late in the second round, and he secured the winner with the team's women halfway out in the end.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that several hundred air passengers escape earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as just after he died and made sure that a plane that had many hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong fear continues to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swinging check tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He was staying to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway just then, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died in a hospital later.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia reported ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the deaths may occur in thousands, and the disaster relief body of the country reports that access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
‘The figures are expected to rise further since many are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach them,’ said the spokesperson for the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have razed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances getting lost.
There's a lack of clean water.
The mini-markets are run everywhere.»
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross works February to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was struck by earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after flying crash in the lagoon
The airline that owns the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean of Micronesia now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the descending plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The carrier did not respond immediately to the request for further details of the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was bombed on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to swim through the deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said that the airmen were panicking and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy told seamen who worked nearby to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane dropped about 30 metres below the surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in a crash with PNG-registered aircraft over the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors concluded the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
USA Analyst in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to put together the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he picked up location data from several phones that showed that Telllis was with Chambers the night she died, which was fighting against what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the cell phone of Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the actor asked about Tellis speaking the truth when he claimed that he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he was "lied because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing indicates that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, the deleted Tellis call, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence shall begin its procedure on Sunday following the plan.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.

They want to go back to the roots and create a socialized hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a new bloom in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Childcareer in New York seeks a couple for cancellation after a "racist" message
A New York passenger seeks a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from her mother, who complained that she was “one black person”.
The couple rejects being racist and compares the case with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a sorceress, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new baby passenger, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day in 2016.
'NOEEEEILY ONE SEARCH PERSON', Plasco-Faxman wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the taboo, it was a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Faxman who said Maurice, claiming that their declared child passenger, who was African American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice seeks compensation for the cancellation and demands compensation in the amount of $350 per day for the six-month, loose-based regime she was promised, but without contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t”, she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back the charges that they are racist and say the cancellation of Maurice was the only right, since they did not feel they could trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come again.’
The comparison of the case with ‘expressing’ said Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to term and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
«Is it such a person you want to punish?
It is not particularly pent", added the share broker.
While the legal case is going on, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behaviour and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put oneself in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was issued.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a little tube bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been turned off, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book was "bitter-sweet" after he left last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father secretly was very proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he was no weird person," she said.
«But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child making a fortune: you are proud of it even though it is not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to honor Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone
On landing the daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors were given the job to save her life.
“Ade called regularly to say that it was so bad that he didn’t think she would survive,” said Ednan-Laperous.
"So I got the phone from Nad who said she came to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I am so happy in you, my friend.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The doctor had given her to get her heart to beat, lost her effect slowly and left the system.
She died a while ago, and the organs in the body collapsed together.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't salute and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who was now worried about the loss of his daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know if the tests she had passed.
"You didn't know," she says.
«I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a steady stream.
It is difficult to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and telephone numbers can call to get help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day,” she says.
45 years old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him in the smile.
They said that his smile could shine up any room."
He ended up at work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry all the time for it to be an infection."
Sharon added the cards “to tell people that there are people out there who can go and talk to, even though there is only a friend.
Don't sit down for yourself--you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed or something,” she says.
«A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On the 1st of Christmas, he was in the basement – when the kids opened the christmas, they did not get eye contact or anything.»
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they must fight through it: "It breaks up a great hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to stand out and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI launches a review
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time- and scope-limited review – we might be able to reach a certain agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee “fell from each other” along the fixed party boundaries.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to review?
The motive was due to the timing.
The middle elections are only five weeks away, 6 November – if the Republicans are likely to make it worse, it will be much more difficult for them to have the man they want elected to the highest right in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators and running lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that wise President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him placed in the highest right.
Number of North Korean falls under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's collection department, said it had been 1127 withdrawals last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices in human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of North Korea's successors are subsequently offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most refugees via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean countries.
China considers the refugees to be illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South – which is technically still at war – has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks on the agreed denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they were largely agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for missing progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally settle down first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the highest right
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the highest-right candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the highest-right.
Pelosi came with the opinions in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could only imagine that if a woman had acted that way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh congratulated the feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was deeply touched by his opening statement, including his almost crying and crying when he talked about his family and the years of high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the committee and calling his claims to him a "great and coordinated murder" organised by liberals who were afraid that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not sit in the highest right since it showed that he was pre-adopted against the Democrats.
“I think he is disqualifying himself with such opinions and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats on it”, she said.
Pelosi felt when she was asked if she would try to lay down Kavanaugh for kingship if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I mean this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the highest right, but also in the right he is now sitting in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently Judge of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obamacaire) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he was considered a conservative judge.
In the question, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partisan person to the highest right and expect us to applaud it," Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair pain, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're sick," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so nice, do you?"
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she got sick, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got sick and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to "you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just went on.
And it seemed to me to be great."
Tears are allowed as the end of pain in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained anger and was caught in the throat of an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little scared of – who took me to a staircase.
"Let them never see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry and be happy because they were able to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was appointed president.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to be disloyal to his wife on board a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of becoming a presidential candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a deliberate decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last needed one was another.
Someone called it "Snowhvit and the seven dwarves".
Since it was the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and swore that she wouldn't stop if she didn't get $2 million in.
There was a lost fight.
She found out that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?" she wondered.
When she held the speech to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was then overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and to reach electors instead of delegates, as well as the mind of sexism – that she fell together in tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls about how the press spoke about her.
"You should think Kleinex was my principal sponsor.
I remember thinking my faith what they would write on my grave support?
'She's crying?'
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Win Beijing
The openings in the US-China trade war were listening, and although the fight is far from over, a rapture between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duties on half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has, of course, paid every time, now at the latest with an attack of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack for attack, and the next largest economy in the world will probably not raise the white flag with the first.
To get Washington to step down means to give in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the US trade war can give China a positive score in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create relationships that start economic ring-ups in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have previously introduced," said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria «clear» for the return of refugees, Minister of Foreign Affairs says
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeal for help to return to the country, which has been razed after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism”, he says.
The State continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now open to voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have taken place every day and their bread of life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would take good care to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the revolt would not be accepted.
Europe guarantees Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The United States star Phil Mickelson, who suffered from much of the tournament, hurt his tea-slash in the water at a couple of-3 16. holes, and had to see herself turned off by Francesco Molinari.

“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t leave.
It's been a tough year.

I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be helping," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.

That was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves out.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to see the future.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were hit."
