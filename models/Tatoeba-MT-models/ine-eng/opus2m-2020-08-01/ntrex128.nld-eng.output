Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
There is education among the members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name becomes ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party’s Wales National Assembly said that MWP ‘is on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for doll.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said the group as a whole was 'unsatisfied' and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party ‘open’ for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet look very similar.
In this context the Welsh letter W is expressed as a short you.
The Committee of the National Assembly of Wales, currently in the process of drafting legislation to carry out the name change, said: 'They are of course members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017 members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Meeting.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be converted to Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach consensus, and in a few weeks they will have to submit a bill on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way in which the National Assembly operates, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when they discuss legislation.
Citizens of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, voters vote whether they want to change the name of their country in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve an attractive dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to requests from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the People's Council on Name Change, said that he will not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, rapporteurs of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is just the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's having it difficult.
“The older people I spoke to said that there was once a café and a church in every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be found."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People now have another way of social contact”, he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people go regularly.’
However, he makes sure that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, ‘and early or late they will be back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the type of people would live that would not help in the remaining refugee species of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy flats in such buildings will be blank,” he says, “which will lead these churches to be closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the leadership of Honorary John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street shopkeepers, an important shopping street in Harlem, where black but rarely could get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Honor Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a pool.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Honorary Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the bear "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played the ball in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bear in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the largest bear of the Riverside Church.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and receivers, some rented by the laymen of the church, others by the bishop.
In July the Consistency (the governing body of the parish, consisting of laymen) wrote to the bishop to express her concern that the bishop 'would want to calculate the costs' to the Consistency, although the Consistency was not involved in the rental of the architects and receivers who had sent the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the bishop.
Haai injured 13-year-old who died of cancer in California
On Saturday, the first day of the cancer season, a shark hit a 13-year-old boy who went to the cancers in California.
The attack took place just 7 hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had covered about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he pedaled into the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy was shouting because he had caught a trap, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: ‘I prayed!
I'm praying!'
His key leg was completely open,' Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to go out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reportedly in danger of life.
It is not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks earlier there was a shark in the neighborhood, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and security.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury wants to break through on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's deals with competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and direct beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill up with other products where TVs, magnetons and interior items have ever existed.
Sainsbury wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees also has more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up again on the market, now most products are suitable for veganists, something that younger shoppers increasingly require.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two Sainsbury's shops. The first is opened in Croydon, in southern London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and more often on a daily basis buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like supermarkets, now the supermarket chains record it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's Argos sales points have been integrated into hundreds of shops and have also opened up a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food has increased and the acquisitions have generated more yield.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Pharmacy a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tried out a cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation was ended when there was a conflict about the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacies in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a wide range of skin care luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the setting up of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands we offer everything we want, and thanks to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer buy in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'enraging' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'enraged' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for True, their homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter announced on Instagram that she's leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is interested in Holly Willoughby, because she recently withdrew from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘enraged’ when Willoughby on Tuesday during a difficult meeting in the main location of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not allow enough time for Truthy, their homeware brand and accessories through her new contracts (with a value of another half million pounds).
The company is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, ‘Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure her long-term future and deliver enough for the next decade.
Everyone was shocked when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was soon planned.
The warehouse of the main location in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the exhibitor, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now lead to further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will soon be the brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones' neighborhood said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business matters.’
Hard Language ‘and then it was love between us’
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media about a remark he made that some people would find 'unsuitable for a president' and about his positive look at the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a new anchor when he said:
‘I didn’t give up.’
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the disarmament of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been held.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a 'conformity' response by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We do very well in North Korea," he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.'
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have led to positive results.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this busy arena, about 200 people would stand here,” Trump said while he was in front of the public.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island with hundreds of deaths
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs heard that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no more housing, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for the launch of international aid.
‘In many cases it is very clear that they are not asking for international aid, which is difficult for us,’ Mrs Sumbang said.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure whether the helpers from abroad can work on the spot.
Dr Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still in the process of assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to assist.
Although Indonesia is constantly being plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh refuges were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you can see these only rarely.
The fact that no warning sirens were present for tsunamis in Palu, even though there was a warning of force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
In ideal circumstances too, it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was established in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's unfavorable infrastructure was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has a lack of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are now following a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic bands fought on the street, with machetes, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides an impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday for the loss of Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres away from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind with 1-0.
He hit the left against the ball and then jumped in the direction of the last pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He developed the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ Sturridge said against LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Edge approaching and pushing an effort. I didn’t really think about it after, I just jumped on the ball.”
Chelsea stood at rest with 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The peaks of The Blues shot the ball with all of it to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the middle field to the playing field of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet on the middle field.
After that, he gave a beautiful stabbing pass, which enabled Hazard to reach the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and cut the ball with his left foot past Alsson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back of the pole.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll of tsunamis in Indonesia runs up to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the Agency for Assistance in National Disasters said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, with also waves coming from 6 m high, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman died
This morning the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police ask the local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just started, but I want everyone who is around John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact them if they have possibly filmed something via a Dashcam. They can have information that is essential to our research.'
A spokesperson for the police confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one can enter or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came weeping on the spot.
She just keeps saying, "What a shame!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the parking lot and a third was just outside.
A number of agents kept an eye on the apartment building during the deployment.
Who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or record anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on number 0800 555 111, with log 247 of 30 September.
Statutory of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' report
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of the many cultural and religious objects of art carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as 'dwas' and 'an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the painting of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclass of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thornecroft, testifies to the opinion that prevails in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many still have to acknowledge.
Dr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Or that it is a completely correct idea, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.'
Murdered Pigs Kill Chinese Farm
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only as ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His drummer was crossed and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to enter pigs at a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have been taken off from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his nephew found him dead and found a door to a nearby pig stable open.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on his neck in the pig’s throat.
A forensic investigation showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, so the report said.
‘The legs of my cousin were bleeding and mutilated,’ said the nephew with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Images of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't from Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were locked up to prevent others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on site.
Negotiations are currently being negotiated between the Yuan family and the market authorities on compensation for his death.
It happens only rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can trigger.
‘They’re just games.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not about to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the hurricane Rosa brings heavy rains to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has since reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains in the coming days to the north of Mexico and to the southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 o'clock and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to save Sunday to the north.
Meanwhile, it begins to form a fortress above the Pacific, which moves east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed north, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching spring will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, torrential currents and possible displacements in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to a drop of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected to be 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly worsening conditions because the tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is most strongly recommended to go into the desert when the tropical rains are threatened.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into desert rivers, and will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching tortoise brings local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coastline.
There are rains of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small torrents and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread on Tuesday over the Four Corners and continue to fall on Wednesday.
In October the temperature in the United States can fluctuate strongly, as the North Pole is becoming cooler, but the troops remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the central and eastern US, it is expected that October will start hot, with temperatures ranging around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
In New York it can become 27 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the opportunity to mid-October is high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people are looking at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people look on one of the six television networks on Thursday at Brett Kavanaugh's impressive testimony, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an attack that occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while the regular programming was interrupted for the surprise of Friday: an agreement that was scheduled to investigate the charge for a week by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had bitten her and tried to get her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a silent testimony that he was 100% certain this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people who have been reported by Nielsen have seen it on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to find it difficult to count people looking at an office.
For comparison: this is about a playoff of a football match or Oscar performance.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's appointment, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: on average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, the public was also very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that witnesses yelled at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with his eyes down while he was being ridiculed, live on CNN.
'I'm right here for you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he is telling the people the truth?
Someone called out, ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office had made a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters sent out everything alive when the judicial committee had to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate hours later.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the idea that the FBI would investigate the charges against the genome by the next week, something that the Democrats are demanding from the minority.
Flake, among other things, was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh properly without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of their plans to leave the European Union 'a political game' with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said her proposal that Britain and the EU had to pay each other was 'absurd'.
Shooting party Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dytheon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, is arrested and is in prison on suspicion of death, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the eye on the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the eye, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he knew that he had shot Wayde with death.
His bail was set at $350,000, says the Attorney.
The bodyguard of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which says that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Refugee Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to a arrest.
Sport Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘student and pursuit of justice.’
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team 'kapot' and 'in shock' were killed by Waydes.
"This is an event that you always hope will never happen," says Wade.
Volcanic as in Mexico City
The ash that is sprayed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern district of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was recorded in the crater and 183 gas emissions and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center detected several swarms and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer appear as on autopaths in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers south-east of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the scale of Richter central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police listen with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the success of pro-independence activists with the opposition police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were detained by the opposition police took over the agents with eggs and powder paint, resulting in dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, screenplays broke out with the police, and the agents pulled their fists up to stop the fight.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sing: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents shout ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they experienced during the protests, the local press reported.
The tensions remain high in the independent region, one year after the 1 October referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the appearance was low and the people who opposed separation were the boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, which resulted in violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on Saturday night on Saturday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration went on, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
“Last year we took one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though they did not, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their famous leaders are absent, either in forced exile or in prison, awaiting a legal case on their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old assembly who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict by politicians was on both sides.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, declared that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after home was framed by a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repatriated in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7.30 a.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is possible that at a given time a cross-bow was also fired on the car.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was to make the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same height as Hibernian.
Gerrards team failed this season to win a race during the Premiership. They have to record Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna received Thursday in Europe League.
The team has won six matches in his department, and Coach Holt hasn't had any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chance against strong visitors
Holt's team had been able to make a breakthrough for the first time. Their direct play took care of all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances to be calm and self-insuranced.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free step and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penal area.
At the time, the Rangers had been in trouble for a long time, but the defense of the housework was unforgivable and the target Liam Kelly had not had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a target.
Scott Pittman scored the ball against the feet of Rangers goalman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a speech by his colleagues from Livingston.
There were constant advances in the prison area of Livingston, but they were refused every time. Twice a prison guard was refused, one after a Halkett attack on attacker Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellent without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their team has almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but in particular Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way in which he has swung the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall were running the tops of their ten.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break.
Even though they played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their normal level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed to turn the home team off once) and the Rangers will now realize they need to play better. They are somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Keulen
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together to breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Keulen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police complained about security reasons when they called on the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The rivaling protests reflect the disunity of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after collision with car
In London a biker died in a collision involving a car.
The accident took place near the intersection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another biker died in an accident with a plane crash on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said agents were about to identify the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed at different locations, buses are being routed and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Cypriots injured in order disorder
Six Cypriots were injured in an order disorder in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison bureau.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still underway.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ dikes have been used to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The Cypriots were treated for slight injuries in the face.
A spokesperson for the Prisoner said: ‘There has been a particularly trained prison staff deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and in any case the responsible are referred to the police and may need to stay behind the trails for a longer time.
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners remain, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison hospital was treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the opposition police were called to prison for a serious order disorder in which staff were attacked with billiards.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to start next week. This is because the remaining energy of hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert, which entails risks of flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and for the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday just above Phoenix. Monday night it will rain already.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘ since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona's border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict a drop of 5 to 10 centimeters, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Becken, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there it is possible 10 cm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall will probably be favorable because the southwest is currently going through a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated makes more than 40 percent of Arizona at least extreme drought, the one reported after the highest category,' weather.com.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa is still at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour on Sunday morning, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific, causing them to weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rains can occur in parts of Mexico, leading to a significant flood risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm result is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ said weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the early morning border with Arizona as a tropical depression, which will then take place on Tuesday evening by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
“The greatest danger that Rosa or her tail is expected is a very severe rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area,” said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains will be expected to result in life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the deserts and earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was injured at around 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, so the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has been among the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the uncompromising and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh 'has been among the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday for the Congress and denied the strong and emotionally the suggestion of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her statement.
On Saturday, the president said that the ‘American people’ saw Kavanaugh’s ‘beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage’ that day.
“A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognises one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the many advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican appearance in the interim elections.
‘Over five weeks one of the most important elections takes place in our lives.
I don't take part, but actually I take part,' he said.
‘That's why I come all over for great candidates.’
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to "offer resistance and hinder us".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will be expected to take place no later than Friday, a top member of the GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from Indonesian earthquakes, tsunamis, and the toll is increasing
In a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many of the land being swept away when giant waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on Friday at the beach in Palu, when waves of just six meters high hit the ground at the time it started to crash. Many people rushed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on Richter's scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Natural Disaster Relief Agency BNPB during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: it dragged cars, tree tribes, houses, it hit everything on the ground,' Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the shoreline.
Some people climb into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On air photos released by the Natural Disaster Relief Office, many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by shocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released at the massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had occurred in the Second World War on Hiroshima.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘respective’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he said. Some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Dongala ‘is completely flat, we do not have any information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living," said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘It’s already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organisation was very critical on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building screams at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and is built and cars merged.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major flow disturbance that cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending trucks with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations still have an urgent need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is open only for assistance and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunamis rises above 800.
It's very bad.
True, the World Vision workers from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the interior of their office looked for shelter in tents of blankets, but passed along taverns of destruction, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a disaster at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been called up.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing ones hoped that they would recover their loved ones, as in the miracles that people are so eager to hear from terrible natural disasters such as this.
Saturday, a boy was taken out of a line.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been in the rubble for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students also stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax,’ he said.
Dr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, only one grey angle appears in his messages instead of two blue angles.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while stockpiling cash in Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, he stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news report from the Newport police.
The driver had just located a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Several suspects saw flights, so the press report, but the police didn't say how many people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been briefly called Ye and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the singers Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the show's maker.
You are not only abbreviation of his current artist name. Earlier West had already told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album to Radiopresenter Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I have moved from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
Rather, the album is a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who's changing his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with West, has worked with and without the link sign and the main letters.
Mexican President promises not to use military forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military troops were on a peaceful march in the square, killing 300 people. During that period, left student movements appeared throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunity to study.
The United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research of A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this on the basis of the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants the number 1 to be at the level of A.I. innovations.
"The research budget for A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.," Lee said.
A double of funding can lead to a double of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google Department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technological competitions organised by the American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
‘China does not include our best academics, companies do that’, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best powers of universities in recent years to work with A.I.
Lee said that American efforts at A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“He who is a doctor at the level of A.I. should automatically get a green card”, he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced the White House the formation of the Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Limited Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the American legislation which should lead to the establishment of a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in 'North Macedonia', thereby arguing with Greece that it has been held for decades and that Greece would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour contains the country's claim to Greek territory. Consequently, Greece put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and by a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required increase of at least 50 per cent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: 'Are you a supporter of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?'
‘The leaders of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth the effort to try to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
"I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a second parliamentary delegation.
The National Elections Committee said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
At that time, however, only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the country's change of name that would open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who had the referendum boycotts.
"We are the proponent of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will make necessary investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is more advocated, because more than 80% of our citizens are advocates of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after delivering his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion published last month by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required attendance.
Another milestone, performed by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, was concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them would vote.
If the referendum is to be successful, the rise must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came into power last May.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and escort
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shorted with the defense of Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a fluctuation of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peaks first received the ball played on the Mediterranean.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defender and was too quick for some others on the edge of Brighton's penal area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right arm to defeat the goalman Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has trouble with his feet,’ coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That was in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player just tapped the ball, right before he was too far away.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The match takes place in the Rhine-Neckar Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals were eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoff. They currently have one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have done at least one game-off game card due to their 5-2-victim against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything they can to ensure their first section title.
“Although there is nothing left for us, at least we can point to the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to do that?
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to set up Scherser as a picker in such a situation.
Scherser, who would make his 34th start, was on Thursday in the input field and would still pee the next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-hand shooter is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the High Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican appearance in the interim elections.
‘All we have accomplished is in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but I do take part. That's why I come all over for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take back the power no matter what they need to do.
It doesn't matter who they're hurting, who they're going to take away to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resistance and hinder us".
“And we’ve seen that for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “wicked and common and false and false”.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee for Justice, which led to a loud call from the public.
‘Do you know what she answered?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to censor me, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who get that we are not welcome simply because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she resolved against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motive for censorship because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, is ironically similar to that of Jeremy, who did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Summit on Friday stated: ‘We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.’
And that was the same during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I have been a local Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, today is not the show of many meetings and the promise of a 'older, softer' policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever begun.
It is increasingly clear that a divergent opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the Party's management or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I, were expecting me to make a change and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European Single Market.
Even when I speak for a public, whatever I say, there are social media gossipers who are called on to reject my candidacy as a member of parliament for the following elections, which exposes the politics of the centre and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's all I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are about general politics.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have every day to deal with a flood of sexual or racist reactions, but do not be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is that very bad parties are considered to be normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every 'cause of mistrust' or change of selection rules the party is getting smaller.
I have often received the advice to keep me informed over the past two years, not just to announce my opinion, and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But for that, I did not go into politics.
Since I was a school member of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government, which literally broke my classroom, I have always appealed for better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as a council member and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my policy hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my political positions and my points of dispute with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will damage our families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are now members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a member of Parliament for the following elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting in accordance with what I believe is in your interest.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsuccessful Air on its way to the top
Two late attempts may have led to some success, but there is no doubt that Ayr rightly triumphs in this glorious match of the day in the Tennant's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the class, the only unsuccessful team of the ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defense and their better chances of winning, and coach Peter Murchie was pleased.
“We’ve had it so far during our fights and we’re still hit, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we have.’
Grant Andersons tried in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to an advance for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Team (which he received during the Warriors match) Melrose was able to make the figures speak and Jason Baggot was able to break down a try.
Climo provided an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long silent for a serious blow by Ruarid Knott, who was executed on a branch card, and once the match was resumed, Ayr was able to proceed by a test by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then the leader Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and again counting Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed a trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of a match with the pressure very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he picked up Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the rising Air-mould for a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Climo provided for the conversion, and did so almost immediately after restarting Kyle Rowe after David Armstrong's box kicking up and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth attempt of the household.
Ster van Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran is leaving Still Game in the choir. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already on its way.
According to official data, he is the Director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'flowering restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Zeeliu patrollers in a ship's office in La Paz with equipment.
At public buildings, an ocean blue flag is armed.
On all the marine bases from the Titicacame to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In the whole country, Bolivia is still alive, as is the desire to re-maintain the Pacific Ocean after a bloody 19th century conflict with Chile.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of consultation.
‘Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the Court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal will plead for the benefit of Bolivia that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea after decades of vicious talks.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial fight for re-election, is much at stake with the statement of Monday.
‘We are very close to the return to the Pacific,’ he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the Court will probably not decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and even if that were the case, there would be little change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to recognise the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the end of the attack, it states that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the past four years the situation may have become even worse.
‘The matter around access to the sea is stolen by the current Bolivian government,’ Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile may still have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the Court's decision was made very quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have ‘an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘end up 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crucible.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington is unable to trust.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that State Secretary Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume the ongoing nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's an 'autopie' that the remaining sanctions and the American objection against a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without first putting important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would reject an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head coverings, soon to be bought near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne reveal a series of crazy overlooked headsets for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, an outstanding set during the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, very impractical guards were not to think away from Instagram and these designers sent their blind creations to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a four-dimensional wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other excess accessories were watermelons possessed with precious stones, a magic hat and even an pineapple, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were close. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on high couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like on a melted ice.
And if you want to follow this crazy fashion, you're lucky.
Stylwatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the narrow hat with a two-metre wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractice hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a narrow beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit that the bag was carrying.
The Rodoran Raffia bag, set off with raffia French and finished with a white leather hanger, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the question of extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with an excellent series of exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career chosen by them and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a well-measured school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build a relationship and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's review, we can derive that languages are on top of the ranking list, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
According to data collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS, 72 per cent of students received a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now rated as professional as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A survey by the British Employment and Vocational Training Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Thus language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more vacancies require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, when he has learned a second language, he will have a real benefit in the future with such a skill for life.
Communication directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouTube poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation. France was the only language that stood above 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, particularly those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers who are specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are involved in providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At the moment it cannot be denied that languages remain of vital importance in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game Sunday before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still need to determine how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers scheme for the six games prior to the season.
‘In this stage of my career, I don’t need a race before the season to prepare for me,’ he said.
Periods of election rallyes from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It is the first of five planned rallyes of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that are close to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming interim elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
How late does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, started tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19:00.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have the hearings for the candidate-up judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra charged now Kavanaugh is being accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the elections in November to get more involved.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallyes were intended next week to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the republics are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Deputies,’ says Reuters.
‘Control of Congress is so important for its programme that the president travels to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season begins,’ said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign that did not want to be mentioned against Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
On Saturday the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia visited will be the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the ranks.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the ranks," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The dazzling ranger of opportunities is a fully invented sport concept, but a true player really believes in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
“They had a lead of six points first, and now it’s only four more, so we find so little that happiness is on our side at the moment”, Jordan Spieth said before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of having four points, while twelve are still at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored every three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he sets the good example.
The typical throat sounds that he makes when he plays well became louder as he made his round progress and he realized a crucial point with which he and Thomas were successful when he and his team were behind two points after two matches.
His well with which they won the 15th match was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can draw that he believes that the American team has not yet been defeated.
‘You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game,’ Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but glorious European duo has four to four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who must be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who will win a European victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
In preference, both at the same time in different holes.
It is, however, ready to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short deals with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a retreat for the Spaniard and the Sweden that they did not get over.
Sunday, however, there's no one who can help get your back.
The four-balls and four-somes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duoes, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can be changed.
So far, the European team has played the best part and has made a fine lead in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to go to the fight, something that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a great lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and Saturday's foursomes, they stand in the United States with 10-6.
The brave Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, which had a hard time, making them four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy they wanted to lose in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the bluffing Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the fursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer recover its resistance.
The team of Jim Furyk has to score eight points during the 12 single games of Sunday in order to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points in line, while Molinari and Molliwood, who received the nickname Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening matches.
After joining Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully intertwined and defeated a disappointing Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5-4-4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed off a wonderful set, but now 19 of his 29 matches have lost in four-balls and four-somes and seven on line.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the fursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kuepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2+1.
However, it was not a rented roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas, with three points, set the norm for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a hard match with 2+1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to pick up a set of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Fury has enough parallels, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in the second place for two days, it seems that an attack on Sunday is too high.
North Korea says it 'in no case' will disarm unilaterally without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions would lead to more and more mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken 'significant goodwill measures' in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, disbanding the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘We don’t see any corresponding U.S. reaction,’ he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not disarm ourselves in any case."
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's rejection of a 'phased' approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea as the next step, he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on 'declaration of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to alleviate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges 'declaration first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way and even by objecting to 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is a castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions are just not going to strengthen us.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader did earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party to this issue of South Korea's denuclearisation was rather than the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.'
However, Ri's speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American continent were directed after 'Mr. Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'rocketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year with the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should continue to denuclearize North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no schedule for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must be continued vigorously and firmly until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denomination.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has imposed unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea forced him to set 'walking requirements'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take 'agreed measures'.
He said Kim had told him that the 'conformity measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and were taking steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor stated that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course.
He got the idea to start with the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of my talk, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I just getting to hear this in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, organised this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help to improve academic and athletic performance and how to promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine when going to sleep.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With the help of a landscape of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the students’ behaviour immediately.
But we think that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of choosing cigarettes on their health, Cheisler added.
The culture of fervor on a night study still exists, he says, and by modern technology and increasing pressure on students is a growing problem.
Providing adequate sleep, of good quality, the student’s ‘secret weapon’ must be to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep short ensures that the brain gives them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to set up the course. After all, he had studied at the high school last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic displays and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga causes Gerrard's men to go down
The Rangers saw their race again frustrating when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a race since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team provided for the defeat, almost the second Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team is now behind eight points on Hearts, which continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now reach the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a major injury after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitors' team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They stopped by Ayr and went to the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleven for Livingston, who had ridden the Hearts a point last week. He would have been excited about how his well-trained team would have blocked the opponents at each set.
The Rangers may have had most of the balls, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga first played the ball and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vision, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free step by Keaghan Jacobs reached Commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgow shot at the back.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than believe in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found himself entitled to a fine when he and Steven Lawless were fighting after a quarter, but divorce judge Steven Thomson took away the Colombian request.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former target at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's thumb shot.
The opening of Livingstone in the 34th minute may or may not sit in the extension of the general game course, no one can deny that they deserve this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were not up against Jacob's deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold blood and chose Menga, who took the ball with ease.
Gerrard provided a break with the change Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This set had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly race from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston remained forced by visitors to play one of the kind of game that Livingston is the favorite to play, with Lithgow and Halkett standing long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final phase of the match, but McGregor kept up and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers called at the end of the match for a fine after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked again on the other side.
Germanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the German of our 'Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today just 136 years ago, for whom one can COUNTY well... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device with the name Geiger Teller.
Since then, the geiger counter has not thought of science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at first sight:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘It is a geiger counter. It is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s really knocking now!’
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to modify them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then injected again
A testvaccin produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the HER2 protein, which often occurs in all types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, professor Berzofsky explained.
A comparable way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to adapt cancer cells has appeared to be working in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West wears pro-Trump-thirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was staged during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inconsistency event in which he won the U.S. President Donald Trump award and said he would become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third number in the evening, Ghost Town, with a pen on his head with the text of Make America Great Again, he pulled off a tyranny against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“Sometimes when I’m talking to a white guy, she asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He’s a racist!’
When I was worried about racism, I was out of America for a long time," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood-star Matt Damon stuck the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Justice Committee in connection with the alleged attack that Christine Blasey Ford accused him of.
The Tiridade of West was not broadcast, but comical Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken under fire for his pet.
‘They have driven me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t get on the stage with that pet.’
They've driven me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would attract her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience, at least twice a book call came and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by an audience: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was too hospitable as last-minute replacement of the singers Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the execution of the number I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: RECOGNIZED YOU THE MASSA THOTSEERT.’
But talk show-representator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘just herself, and that’s wonderful.’
‘But I choose to reward someone who is an ideology that damages, supports, and exhausts my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We, too, added them.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collegiate rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the last musical Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The Artist formally knew as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder to party in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The complainant is expected to appear on Monday for the police judge in Belfast.
The accusation will be investigated by the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Game of Thrones-ster Kit Harington leads to toxic humanity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out the stereotype of the macho hero and says that when young boys see such roles on the screen they often think they must be stuttered to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that ‘something had gone wrong’ and asked himself how the problem of toxic humanity should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-ster of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem should be addressed.
'This is an important question for me personally at the moment: where has it gone wrong with our humanity?' he said.
"What did we learn from men when they grew up, which now makes us face this problem?"
Kit thinks that television could once be partly responsible for the increase in toxic humanity by its very male characters.
He said: What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street, which makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series is finished next summer, because he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit is playing in a Revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is overwhelmed.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that his meeting with his wife Rose was the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that way I kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 to the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not so in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said during a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reportedly widespread.
The conservative values of land would result in an estimated 70 to 90% of men who had sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The diseases are often transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and derives information from 'dangerous lies' and 'complimentary theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters opposes the allegations that one of her staff members has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the charges are spread by ‘extreme rights’ of the defendants and websites.
‘Tliegens, lies and more common lies’, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include, inter alia, the private address and telephone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts is linked to the Waters office and contained information from a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.'
Waters' statement was already on the line of criticism online, including by former press employee of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry,’ Fleischer wrote.
‘From here you can discover that she does not have the temper to be Congressman.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He doesn't have to be rebellious.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to stay calm and healthy."
Fleischer appeared to compare the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the hearing on Thursday.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, gave his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are known,” she said, “and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new movie with a British feature, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that is indeed to apply to this Revival of the Johnny English-Franchise, the comic action films with a slow spy in the headhole, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satisfaction about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with pulsating eyes and flexible faces manages to send everything in a hundred, including his second comeback. From his name you can already derive that he is a general comic character that was meant for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamorous, a little Clouseau, a fly Mr. Bean and a little bit of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson ever played in Barclaycard's TV spots (who everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain mess.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor leaves just ticking against his helmet.
Atkinson can show you in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do so well.
The humour seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and the doll disaster of Johnny English comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the text of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Britain is experiencing great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making it known the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain, to large deployment of the agent in office, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket pass from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her best with this character that makes Teresa May think, but the script does not provide much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she has to set up a retired spy as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chice institution, but informally teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spy readers of English who think of School or Rock.
English is quickly offered on Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former peaceful aid Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, an insatiable and youthful role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is disappointed at the charms of the charismatic technology environment that he claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their odyssey of funny doll fun: dressed as bosses they put a discreet French restaurant in fire, they kick a gentleman on board the luxury search of Volta and English exposes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
To that end, all registers are opened, but no matter how well-intended and unscrupulous the scene is, she does something about child television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other movies of Johnny English, I ask myself: can the British film sector really not think about the role that Rowan Atkinson's talent can play?
Labour denies that the party is planning to work four days a week in Britain, but is paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan for Britain to work four days a week but for five days.
According to the party, companies' bases would like to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
This allows workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn a lot.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to make the country's balance sheet in the direction of the workers is ‘appropriate’.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Associations of Trade Unions, which found it a good way to ensure that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at the same time, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits into the party's effort to make the balance in the economy more balanced for the benefit of the workers and that also fits into the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party has already promised a four-day workweek in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A spokesperson at the Labour Party said: "A four-day workweek is not a party's policy nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour's conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'faceless drivers' and the 'winners' in utility companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, because a Labour Government could apply 'reduced' on the basis of observed malpractice.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to set up inclusive Ownership Funds, which give 10 per cent of the share of companies’ private sector employees that can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh may change their mind
The investigation of the FBI's allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a definitive vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week delay and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview that is broadcast Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley would soon be able to find out something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open here than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, undoubled."
However, Graham's voice seems to be strong.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamics," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday is organized in New York at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and that knows a equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting here.
Concerters who wanted to use a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mailing, making a phone call or otherwise generating a meaningful awareness for the purpose: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand an action call or is this just another form of 'clitivism', people give the feeling that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, aimed at a number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and declarations on the basis of the actions, of which at least $10 billion was paid out or brought together by sponsorship.
The group estimates that the funds received so far have had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realize their full potential'. This group has promised Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens as well as you can make a footnote in history of the social injustices that are malnutrition," said Tracey Ulllman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children would reach with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the many questions on the Global Citizen website that asked "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group said, "It will be a long and difficult path. Sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, like civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will finally be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists that will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can set up the Navy for a 'block' to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister of the Interior
Washington can 'if necessary' take refuge in the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the waterways remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited people during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with no profit target that appears to be the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuel," he said and referred to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is trying to stimulate and replace exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the 'unsuitable' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trum van Berlin has made Moscow's 'prisoner'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only sent for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third possibility is faced with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'considers seriously after' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she was "thinking seriously" to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the corrupt government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about it to make myself elected president."
Warren ran out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said that he "is sending that country in the wrong direction".
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren's own attachments did not consider it to be optional in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said the senator was not to be elected, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty percent, though, was for her to make herself optional.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent before a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
He said he would officially take a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about the PTSS of Track Palin during a selection meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he took up his ministry in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday.
"What my own son has to do, what he is doing now is back, I understand for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with," she told the public that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and become tougher, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military have given to the country of the father".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, involved in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum to victims who are on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. last Friday, as 'friend-from-het-hof', submitted a statement to the Washington Court in support of an asylum seeker contesting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union annexed to federal policy in August has not been announced.
She says her partner "and her violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people who apply for asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned a decision from the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents on the run for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday that the new policy "neglects ten years of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" shall be laid down in a declaration by the 'friend-of-the-court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of giving immigrants access to the U.S. is damaging the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provided with the necessary labour forces'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion", according to Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get every day, everywhere in the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
A clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched their overnight possessions for valuable things they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, unless they are damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on Richter's scale.
Some wounds, including Dwi Haris, that have broken back and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the chance of severe back shocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the rest of a wall," Haris told an associate of the Associated Press and added this when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimacy' with 'propaganda advertisements'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted an advertisement of four pages’s in an American newspaper, which presented the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to China Daily's paid annex in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the US Congress elections of 6 November, a charge that is rejected by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to cope with the US elections marked, according to US officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a escalating trade war, where they have imposed higher import tariffs on each other.
China's payrolls early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, as said by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government uses freedom of expression and a free press, a long-scrupulous tradition in America by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find the votes in vain and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have made possible on the difficult economic path, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newsletters refused to publish his article", if he didn't tell us which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh-debacle, the Republican women's electorate for the interim elections, warned analysts
Many important republics are now spreading around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will lead to a relapse, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around this issue have grown enormously, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to go through with the vote.
"These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake (Republicin, Arizona)'s attempt to appeal at the last moment for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November is coming in!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall, while the Republicans under the control of the Justice Commission have a choice to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among women's voters in the out-of-weeks and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the President."
Even for Ford's public witness, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the High Court, analysts suggested that there could be a relapse if the Republicans were to suppress the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote or about Kavanaugh taking place in the court, but also about the way in which the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, at the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided about the question they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing off on the side of the latter.
A new opinion survey by YouTube shows that 41% of respondents are sure or likely to believe Ford's testimony and that 35% are sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's statement, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford explained last week to the Senate Justice Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a festival at the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to capture Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to engage with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology project, is a company based on the open source platform Solid van Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contact persons, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be saved.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to have a conversation with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that puts all their business models completely on their heads at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium, published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he set up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Water: Spiritual and Carrier of the Victoria Cross from WHO I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honorary Bernard Vann won the distinction following the attack at Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was discovered by its two minor zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the minor zones, Michael Vann, said it was 'bright symbolic' that the stone was exposed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under fierce fire of field fire and machine guns".
He then stormed through the fireline and led the line forward before he only ran to a field fire and turned off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I can never tip about, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also placed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the resilience of a true hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've been up all night to watch a trained Bellator 206 and you won't get to see the most important moment.
There were 13 matches listed on the San Jose plate, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared themselves for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were uncomfortable when the broadcaster switched over to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had been awake for this fight all night.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the government's regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no content that is not suitable for children should be displayed any more, and that is why we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked to broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yess.
Scott Coker, Business President of Bellator, said they would adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom would have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the fight back, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there went a lot of text messages and believed me, they weren't all as friendly.
We were trying to solve it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally have done, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic Cleanser Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual nature, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said he didn't realize until he continued his education that 'not everyone is like me.'
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homo rights to give hope to others.
He also said that the parents had contributed to his less value for winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Apparently as a shift to Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to find both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day are those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was someone, so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally found out what he was like.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals became a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Community Games in Australia this year to call more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley married Oscarwinnaar, 20 years older than he was, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have to endure so much," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has taken the same heights and low points.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already got the cards for London in 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say you won't be there to sit on the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breath actually died and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed of this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music selection, Proud by Heather Small, who had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and where he still got chicken.
Desert Island Discs is to be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, at the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape back so as not to make a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who for the 12th time participates in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, in an attempt to recover where it ends.
Because he was never even at the top of his career known for his right drive, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the rough-dwelling balls routinely fines.
And if the job on itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will come on Sunday in the ninth match the always accurate Francesco Molinari, British Open winner, against who is connected to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who stand behind four points at the start of the 12 single games start well, the Mickelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Furik has shown that he has confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back, beat his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been included in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I expected more, but it is what it is and it is the way we have to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never completely matched the top points of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his name, but Fury said his presence had a certain irrefutable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's busy, he likes to get jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players found it fun to keep him up for the crazy last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great progress can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
De Den made his debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You remember yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we live, but just," said Bjorn, here, after seeing the 2018 lighting win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Go ahead and run the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and that's where we need to keep our focus.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Glad about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of things in this area.
A new challenge awaits tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual performances are coming to an end, and that is again a very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner as good as it is, but when you stand there alone, your abilities as a golfer are just really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furik himself has experience with both sides of this kind again on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had raised his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to get started, like in Brooklyn, or like in Medina.
When we have the moment, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have matched our line-up on this and we are sending the men on the way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the offensive and puts Rory McIlroy into the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is being postponed again
The latest German Navy frigate should have come into service in 2014 to replace the older warships from the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The establishment of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the leading ship in the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 shall be replaced by the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air defence and anti-shipcraft missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put in place the latest freights up to two years later, away from home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships, designed to allow Germany to project its power overseas, have been obsolete by the time they are put into operation, that is the time.
The fateful F125 frigate got the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would render the warship useless if it was used in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the freight of the older Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweighted, thus reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a comparable class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including staff training, becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached €3.1 billion, compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that have the latest frigates in their grip are extremely important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Parliamentary Defence Committee in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy actually "has a lack of suitable vessels".
The officer said that the problem over time as a snowball had grown, because old ships were taken out of business but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the badgers of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new survey carried out on a property in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will bring new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the usual and small drug-fighting mouse, the brown wholesale mouse and the waterfighting mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats during the season.
NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat’s shells and what kind of action is being taken.
Then a map of the habitat and a report is produced to make such a detailed picture on a landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Flying mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and sparks can also pose a risk, like pilots and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their nightly hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, carry out sleep inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
Landscape Manager David Thompson says the land is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Thrave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known and therefore the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to do."
He emphasises the importance of checking bats before maintenance operations are carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a bed may lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, which may eliminate a whole local population.
Flea mice are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, cause trouble or disturb them, or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo charges of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain about the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges were published.
The peaks of Portugal and Juventus are accused of attacking an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called a few hours after the charges were reported, reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Ballen on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be named by my name, but that's part of the subject.
I am a happy man, and by and by well" added the footballer, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the footballer's room, where he raped her according to the accusation, as is to be read in the charge filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a '99%' good guy', but that he was sometimes let in that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sex but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial regime because she was 'feared by the consequences' and because she was concerned about 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to make the scheme invalid because she is constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer to the Italian giant Juventus left in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: leaving the United Kingdom 'will be forever sorry' as car producers
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that the 'storage' was that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily put production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese auto producer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' job would be costly.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that as Britain crashed from the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory styling," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without an agreement to operate cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already indicated that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns the car manufacturers are concerned about the risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby every 37 minutes components arrive from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there can be an alarm at the boundaries that industry may have led to delays and cuts in parts.
Toyota cannot save more than one day to stock in the factory in Derbyshire, as the company had indicated, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Clark said the Theresa May Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU 'exactly agreed to avoid those border checks'.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 today's program.
"The proof, not only of Toyota but also of other producers, is that we must be able to go through with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would have been stopped, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the competitive position of the company and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is the representative of the United trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back.
One government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'another week' while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump and Russia's assistants and possible obstruction of the presidential process.
The question whether Trump is going to dismiss the deputy prosecutor-general and thereby endangers Mueller's independence, the Washington rotary machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of holding a microphone to engage in talks with Trump and to dismiss the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the round he was about to give in to his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to fire Rosenstein 's prefer not', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the chief of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is not yet a date fixed, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters have been having trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scariest of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'attentional' TV journalists, however, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is doing more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without giving proof: "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of things and you've seen us do that often in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why he made an open and sometimes bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter about Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish to continue working with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has firmly declared its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the US and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also taken up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be an uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the NHS' work and to offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fast and safe at home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes rapid surgery after major injury
The Tennessee State Tigers' line baker, Christian Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident was short for rest.
"He came to the sideline and lay there a little or more," Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie directly on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'there are no details yet known about the type or extent of the injury' and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was charged in total five times on Saturday before leaving the field, which means he was charged in total 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher bids when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new conservation plans
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in the number of allowances is raised for persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to be £ 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable houses and to tell this to multiple-earners.
The increase in the gap is raised on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being put into an effort by the government to combat unemployment.
The grant, which comes above the current leases, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects in this way to raise up to £ 120 million per year.
According to estimates, 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the United States, which increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the roof.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the law to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to eliminate quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'household damage' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to the "without neglect".
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "Last year, I said that I wanted to spend my time as the Prime Minister on restoring the British Dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the United States and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of ever having a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it's his 'ultemal ambition' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the club from the northeast of England, currently in the third place in League One, on three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiery last season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my father's country.
But I was selected for the B team and with that, the kiss was off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, I saw my father, Scotland, play in Hampden Park often and it's something that keeps me attracted.
However, this possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, rather he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this moment is measured by 'Can I let this club go back to Prime Minister League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it must undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It is not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross has just been in his career as a manager for three years, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to the third division and transformed St. Mirren from the edge of the degradation to win the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I was doing the best I could, I earned quite well, and I knew a few reasonable points.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're dealing with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the department, but management just feels good.
I always want to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a paint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in the summer has made revenue increase from British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover rising by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, show the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Over-the-end sunlight and the fact that England has been participating in the world championships for longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had sold 2.8 per cent more, with the difference that the restaurants were now more affected.
The fall of 1.8% in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars that aimed at the sale of drinks served the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than those restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also focused on the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out for a drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking sales were 6.6 per cent higher per month, while food sales were 3% lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the output market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent per year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food operators and only the time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary support."
Total turnover in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One out of five children has a secret social media account that they keep secret for their parents
One of the five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals an investigation
Survey among 20,000 high school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta-page'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'head' account that they also show their parents
One out of five children, some not over 11 years of age, makes social media accounts they keep hidden for adults.
An investigation among 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta-accounts', a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'head' account that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to ' rape her'.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses) of independent schools, found that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them maintained personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Elid Doyle becomes the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish World Council as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports drivers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilhid enjoys great respect in the sports community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who is now regularly commenting on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "This month I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn or I will recover and to what extent.
It has been awfully hard work, but I am now fully restored, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!"
An ad for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, the producer of consumer technology, issued an ironic, inspired advertisement on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to deaf mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a well-filled shed on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these aren't eggs, these are my breasts'.
The refresher then follows with: ' pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I fed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, directly provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has triggered hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions of viewers, in which many people say that this is the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the order" is written in a response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding beehive (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noted: "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad, and a woman admitted that she found the song "hilaric".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking for it too much.
This is a brilliant product," wrote someone.
Someone else had the following remark: "It's a funny ad, focused on moms who screws (often at work or in a toilet) and then feel like they just have to be 'cows'.
This advertisement is not entirely positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who swallow may feel just like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly in a diet, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on curves.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is a dermate revolutionary product that it deserves a stuttering and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between swallowing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the flask and the associated challenges in the lighters and at the same time show in a supportive and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrants has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to provide children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chance of staying in the country by registering for a child.
That risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should print their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified to the fact that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of those sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminals.
We are pursuing these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules, which obliges some of them to appear before the court within 60 days, as was the standard, according to the employees at the station.
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, instead of in person, to plead their application for a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the workers at the station and according to reports that have come from the system over the last few months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a greater facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child fighting are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them still struggle with.
Syria recommends that the US, France and Turkey 'occupational power' withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mullem also called back the Syrian refugees, even now the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also vice-premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, in order to combat terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been robbed and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this holy war until we freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possibly illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were favourable for their return and he insisted on "spreading some Western countries with irrational fears" which left most of the refugees.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bubble of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has led to a major attack by the Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be 'destroyed'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government members and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and open the way for elections.
Moualem made it clear what the conditions for the Syrian Government to take part in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to review the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency was temporarily terminated by a dismissal procedure and scandals.
In what undoubtedly would be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency ever'.
At this point, however, there are no signs of sightiness.
Since 2014, the figures have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC during the 'prime-time' period.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of the evaluations for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the leader behind the ABC drama "Designated Survivors" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
"He said 'because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can influence or determine the future of Roe v. Wade whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you're watching that you've been looking for a panel of experts for six hours who discuss the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who have it about the Jack of Pope's Teaching of Paul Manafort that cost $15,000 ('a piece of clothing full of surprise' according to The Washington Post) and who are discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
Anyway, I'll never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he's stopping you every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plots (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was looking into MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Commission and the future of the Court of Justice at stake.
"I remember that we did all those weird shows not long ago, and that people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Outflow money in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an abundance of money, thanks to the re-election of a electoral district, which requires two representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The recently re-assigned district of Pittsburgh meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has won his seat in another district in a special election in the past spring.
Lamb is to be taken against another representative of the people, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of coverage with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Court of Justice of Pennsylvania held in January that the old districts were not legally classified ('gerry') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign financing between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a grand victory in a well-viewed special election for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had acquired this district with 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China and rejected this
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the minister's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received US aid $140 million in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some government top officials knew that they wanted the conference to continue, making it impossible for El Salvador to take all possible sanctions.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence is giving a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys have returned without further lifting to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without hard messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesperson for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and spoke on an anonymous basis.
Study history
The next step can be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-operation of the trial by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller's research is likely to also focus on coexistence between the Trump and Russia campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump must be responsible for that institute, just as he is prepared to address the electors again, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a court of law.
That is a hope, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, or that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officials were ready to execute a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only when the West had ordered resistance and Czecho-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We missed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and this speeds up or slows down the inevitable threats of democracy.
Americans are currently confronted with various of these kinds of bending points.
What will we do when Trump deputy prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein is released, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this paper reported that, over the past year, he had proposed to speak to the President in secret and that he had speculated about the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the report by The Times is not correct.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe we won't miss the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on the table on which a shower was painted.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans van Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Wien on a visit on Thursday and know that a win on the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
The midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game from the season until the 2-2 match at Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that outcome as a jumpboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but seen all over the game is a similar game probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we got out in the second half, we were the best team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can achieve three points, but it is going to be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is going after us, I am sure that we can press through and that we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been hard, of all that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it.
I hope we can push through now, leave the past season behind and be successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they were talking to their husbands about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10% said that they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't need to take the steps to hold this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance at Nationalwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will get care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in the arm: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options, including a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or to invest your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Place your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when the insurance is to be used.
Take care of a complete health care authority, so that you can identify a trusted person who can review your medical care and ensure that professionals will abide by your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a mandate for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do this yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies in that case?
Put these details in a written plan, so you have the information in hand.
"It's not only the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that the plan comes."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, 40 plus, was located in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents describe the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willing act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the expectation is that the death rate will continue to rise.
As a result of the decommissioning of the means of communication, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the movement with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Dongala is a regent that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regent, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have been regularly hit by tsunamis during the last hundred years by the Agency for the Combat of Disasters from Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west Dongala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provided a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on Richter's scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on the scale of Richter hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the Pide Regency in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found death by falling buildings.
2018: More earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist country Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and ensured that thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Senior son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president, is arrested for domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the trial, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman-in-law tried to call the police to report the alleged arrests, he removed the phone from her.
Palin is held in custody in the Mat-Su storage house with a bailout of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly aware' when he was asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves as the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His friend claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans, after she had linked the violent behavior of her son to PTSS, that he would have spent his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunamis: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on Richter's scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been turned off while the prospect is that the death toll will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the centre of Celebes, located north-east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sayfoello Saypov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people have been killed, a rare penalty that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was already on his way to the footpaths and bicycles.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 'willfully' killed the eight victims and 'willfully' suffered serious physical injury, according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is sought, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The death penalty is possible for both charges, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way in which Saypov carried out the attack as 'grievous, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellavitsj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was more than ten years ago that a death penalty case occurred in the Southern District of New York.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not give evidence of revenge in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the investigator know he felt good about his act, she's the police.
Saypov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, the police told him.
He did not plead guilty to charge 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saypov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma of these events to all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should guide the Brexit negotiations
Today, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize a People's Army" during a protest at the Conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the "hot" of the Eurosceptics, while one of his own MEPs proposed Theresa May to lead him in the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that the UK 'would already be out' when Mr. Farage Brexit was Minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the highly divided leaders is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who are participating in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the way while this is being attacked by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Competitors insisted that she would continue and try to close a deal with Brussels in spite of the obstacles, and thus force Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw 'Checkers in the garbage dump.'
He suggested that Farage should be guided and that it should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had done the job, we'd be out of it now," Bone said.
The parliamentary member for Wellingborough added here: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the garbage."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Since the 2016 referendum, it has been suggested that public opinion has been changed: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexitee Andrea Jenkins also participated in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we get elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a message addressed to May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians must feel the "hot" if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say to them, 'We won't let you get away with this.'
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, on fire.
We are mobilizing the people of this country who have taken care of our victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud UK again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists swam with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after setting up this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Upper House for Labour, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can ensure IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'go good' about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she 'will think well of her candidacy for the presidency' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican delegate who was co-chairman of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been the focal point of speculation that it might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came into power.
A present asked her if she would prefer the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00.
They provided a free video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot down and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died of its consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot down by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has been known to have been present at the crime scene, to have been in possession of a gun and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and is arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98 meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 matches and started last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him the victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel went into the pizza and left Hamilton in the crowded rides in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came up again after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to release space from the inside after a double movement in the third bend.
Max Verstoppen started from the last place and was the seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he remained at his band selection and leaned on fast finish, so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he went to the pits, to which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did his best all weekend.
The team did its best for the seats one and two" said Hamilton.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting on the fact that she was not fully the source of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly have the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Commission. Instead, he indicated that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, dishonest and dishonest'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and rude and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the press reports and leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
You still know?
Diane Feinstein, did you read?
You know her answer... you read the document - 'Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't read.'
Well, wait a minute.
If we've been shot... no, we've not been shot," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter addressed to Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and read in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't read her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me confidentially to go and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president did not believe her denial, and he made a comment at the meeting on Saturday evening: "I will tell you something, that was not good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the candidate for the High Court, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power, with all necessary means.
You see the community, the indifference, they don't give anything to those who hurt them, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control," the president would have said according to a Mediate report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have approved the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals led by scores by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the crew by the side, before Dwyer brought the Giants back in.
Francois Bouchard made the equivalent for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals assured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a retreat on Friday night to then beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, during which the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on a assistant from Kendall McFull. David Rutherford gave the assistant with whom Beauvilier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
During a press release period, Sullivan brought home the team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the introduction to Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants enjoyed the first rest with a lead, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team picked up and Bouchard brought them back to a stand with a power-play ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the match, late in the second period. He provided the victory with the fifth goal for his team, half way in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could ascend safely on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Strong shocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agg refused to leave his post in the wild to-and-again mobile carriers of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then completed on the runway, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic jams, when he thought it was in ruins.
He died in the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, a spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to the thousands and that the country's disaster management agency will know that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It assumes that the death rate is still rising because many bodies are under the rubble and are not yet reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the agency.
The waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive burial site will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Each minute bodies are introduced by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is developed in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived Sunday in Palu and said to the present military: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people dying.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that ran the flight crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says another man is missing, after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger will be missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane was hit by water during landing at the Chuukeiland airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the American Navy both say that the aircraft has landed in the lagoon and the runway has disappeared.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was getting very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told us that he and some others were able to swim in the water, which came to their aid, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewards were panicking and shouting and that he had a slight headache.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors who were at work at a yard also helped with the rescue operations by taking people to the coast with a blasting boat before the plane went further in the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but that does not apply to Air Niugini.
Analyst determines the timeline of the night on which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his claim on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, presented a testimony for several hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone records of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed that Telllis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told me he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "dealing because my truck was in Nashville then."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told us that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The mobile phone data said they knew each other just one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact details of his phone some time after the death of Chambers.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the day after the talks.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hippop'?
A hippoptrio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol suggests that hyphen is foreign from the origin of political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to get back to the roots and make 'conscious hippop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had another experience in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York Juvenile's wife is a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York Juvenile's wife is a married couple for the judge's dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother had the complaint about 'again such a black one'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the case 'depression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, showed her dismissal when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she first met her in 2016.
'NEEEEEEWER ZO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Faxman wrote a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper, the New York Post dismissed Mrs. Plasco-Faxman, who felt "uneasy" when she realized her blindness, saying that their former stepdaughter, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by a taxi.
Now Maurice is giving it to the court to get compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to work inside the family, even without contract.
'I want them to feel that you're just not doing something like this,' Maurice said last Friday in the New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple hesitated with the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after she, being offended by her, feared that they could no longer trust her.
My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco's husband to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so.
Compared with 'during the trial', Plasco said his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
'Would you like to chase someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic," added the investment banker.
While the case is pending, the public opinion is quick to take over the couple on social media, where it is suspended for their behaviour and reasoning.
The editors of Paddington feared that the public would have little interest in a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even for the first time.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it is very comfortable.'
She told her father that, before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, when a cameraman worked with the British broadcaster BBC, he was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "Bittersweet" felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said, that her father was domestically proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so vital to him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you're proud of yourself when you did nothing for it.
I think he's about as successful as Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he made the bear himself for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it was very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then came Nad's phone to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to apologize for her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumped, slowly developed and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything off.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't grieve, scream, or cry because I was in the middle of a lot of people and families.
I really needed to be big."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now complaining about the death of her daughter, was on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears remained but came.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Ruining women put messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have been victimized by suicide are strong enough to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspirational messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an enticing grin.
He was famous for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit every room.
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of his life.
Mrs Davis said, 'I constantly worry about a chain reaction.'
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't be quiet - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling dark or depressed or something," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally on the ground on Christmas Day - when the children took out their presents he didn't even look at them or anything."
She said his death was a great trauma to her, but she had to deal with it: 'It's breaking the whole family apart.
It's driving us out.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain while the FBI investigates
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asks for, a study limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again', so last Saturday, Mr Flake added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other', in the middle of a firmly anchored fit within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has to do with timing.
The interim elections have been held for over five weeks, on 6 November and if, as the Republicans are expected to do, their efforts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would provide Mike Pence, Vice-President, with the opportunity to issue the ruling vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the High Court.
Number of passersby in North Korea 'remove' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean crossings to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong and seven years ago.
Park Byeong-soog, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Eenwarding, states that there were 1.127 passersby last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park states that more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Korean passers-bys are finally offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the passersby to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often puts them out with violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, which discussed in particular the stagnant negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in large lines to work on the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of a lack of progress in lifting US sanctions.
'Without faith in the US, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step in unilateral disarmament', Mr Ri said during a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman would behave like this, they would call her 'hysterical',' Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited; at times he cried almost and was especially from the area when he told about his family and his high school.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him 'grossful and coordinated murder', organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
'I think he is disqualificating himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats,' says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to impose an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth at Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving,' Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the 'District of Columbia' court (usually abbreviation D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law on affordable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the High Court during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to be joyful if a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed in the Supreme Court," says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just tiring of months and years of intense anger that passes, and it can only cry to get it out.
"We'll cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
'I don't think that's weird, do you?'
She said, 'I have been greatly helped by a woman who was leading somewhere and who told me that she was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, which always when she got angry, went crying. She said to the one she spoke to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partly permitted as an expression of anger, because tears are essentially misunderstood.
One of my best memories left from an earlier job, in an office dominated by men, was when I had to cry terribly because I was disablingly angry. An older woman, a guy who was a little afraid of everyone, grabbed me into my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and happy they got you in the box.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart for his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was engaged in an external affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catswaad' or 'apentraken') and withdrew from the race, Mrs Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed that there was no reason why she would not run for herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
'There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'.
Because the campaign had already been advanced, she was behind with fundraising, so she did not promise to join if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she asked herself.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would still not start a formal campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she stuck in it.
'I would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' Mrs Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
'They'll think Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I still remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Be Decomposed for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the US and China was overwhelming, and although the fight has not yet been fought, a gap could be drawn between the two countries according to long-term experts for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, earlier this year gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were released for $200 billion (€150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming from China from the US.
Beijing has taken revenges in nature every time, most recently by increasing prices from 5% to 10% for $60 billion for American goods.
China has promised to match the U.S. every time, and the worlds will probably not quickly cut their eyes on a later major economy.
To let Washington bend requests have to be granted, but public bending for the US is too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is playing the smart, the trade war with the US, China could be positive in the longer term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which could bring one of the two countries into a free economic fall, is indeed much more dangerous than observers have recognised before,' said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a thought specialist in national security issues, focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to let refugees return, so Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war of more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in his country would improve.
'Today, the situation is more stable and safer on the ground, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwestern of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the Ryder Cup in Europe has not won since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team won the required 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost the whole tournament fighting, let his long battle from the tea into the water landed at par. 3, hole 16, and allowed his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranking player on the world ranking list, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which could be the last game played in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the fable to his countrymate, John Ram, who goes to defeat the American legendary Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The huge pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods. I always followed that guy when I grew up,' said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the largest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The US leader, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I am proud of these guys, they have fought.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a little bit more difficult.
We're offering opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're lost.'
Red glow update: Concentrations take off in the provinces Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
