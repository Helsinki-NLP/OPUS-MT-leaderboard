At the end of the exchange, Prague stock exchange in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange receded its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ actions reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall of the watch, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of shares on Wall Street.
The response of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the Stabilisation Plan for the American financial sector, is also perceived by us.
Take action in Asia
The Asian scholarships will result in a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indices succeed in eradicating some of the losses during the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost four percent during the trades, but later it cleared some of the losses and reduced the decline to close to 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Index Enterprises following the move of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have lost 3.8 percent, with the markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the rescue action in the United States will affect the financial markets of the world," notes Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets up its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
The U.S. Blood bath
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft financial support system, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (about 12 billion Kč).
The legislators are thus renouncing the appeal for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. shares will have a blood bath and the main indexes of shares will be the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, having suffered a fall of such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it fell freely.
Congress ceda: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
He shall be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
US legislators made a decisive turnout in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns), granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and submitted to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
He said Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Regulation of the House.
According to sources, the plan should be submitted to the Senate on Wednesday as soon as possible.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor to undermine financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "dissolve".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilise the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
The latter should buy from financial corporations inventable real estate assets that lead financial corporations to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this plan to restore markets, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators make sure Congress completes a final agreement on Sunday.
They therefore wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could influence Monday's trade.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote, even if the negotiations do not risk being blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount of the system aid must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress has the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, in two stages: first $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress made in the negotiations
Although the President may put his veto on this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put him in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain funds for the purchase of bad real estate assets, including the fall in value, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday at the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bilateral effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, a negotiator-in-chief, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors against losses, the agreement of deterioration, and the progress of the timetable.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of such gold parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee that will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new accounts in the case of mortgages it will purchase, while reducing the monthly accounts of debtors and allowing the latter to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance Manager David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to achieve.
"And this is because one ignores what the mechanism and the price of purchasing assets to problems will be.
This point will be decisive to deal with the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, on the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, starting this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it to it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this point," Marek stressed.
An extremely advanced fight: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you on how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to read MP3 files, no MP3 player knows how to call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent sufficient reasons for seeking an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end gramophone for the house to put the new Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on a vinyl disc, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
However, if there are in your layers of vinyl hard drive, with rock, jazz or blue art, you will probably dream of at least one such gramophone.
It is the same with music during the moves, that is, compressed music, to say in a simplified way - from music to MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting the audiences bought for twenty crowns on the market.
Here are two extremes, between which there is plenty of room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of batteries is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than a simple music reading, but it is unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calls and text messages, he is able to read music and movies, to record the latter, he has a variable-quality photo device and may, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take the Smartphones and the communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we practically attend to a miracle.
However, the universal character of the furniture is not without disadvantages.
The longer the number of functions you use is large, the longer the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfrequents.
Rarely are the mobiles that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call from time to time, make sure, to be on top, a second reload for work - this is even valid for the most expensive devices.
The problem will not be solved for MP3 readers who are capable, following a recharge, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices have a USB universal connector, since not all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers can take without reduction, given the tiny sizes of memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for readers, you do not need any software except for iPod.
It is enough to complete the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobile and readers themselves will create a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then according to the user's judgment.
Some devices only show an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Crown, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a specific device, focus on the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, on the ease of control.
If music is mainly a background noise for you and if in the day you are going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you will have enough of any mobile reading the MP3.
Almost all mobile phones today are capable.
You are not even obliged to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
All are able to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have just this format.
It is part of the most widespread formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read from the WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, online music purchases.
It is enough to visit the corresponding operator's (or other provider's) web pages from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service to him alone should be a compelling reason to provide a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable, and it is limited, in most cases, to high-speed radio tubes.
The prices are no longer the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of purchasing music (i.e. GSM, Internet, or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their own furniture.
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have listeners or a free handset with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the integrated systems, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The lowest cost is usually less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, we can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also provided by an entrance for ordinary listeners, does not exceed 15 thousand.
On the other hand, readers have the advantage of having an easy order.
Indeed, anyone who can ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random mobile Internet, followed by a huge data transmission invoice.
Which device to select
Even the least expensive mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even come out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Crown, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding audiences, choose specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control buttons for MP3, and this is how the control handle gets closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farther in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a lifetime of the battery (usually 3 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Possible
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering practically the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classical operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't miss it for a long time.
We have repeatedly mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
ČTU (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed it.
Thus, as a result of the European Commission's last steps in regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Agency Council (ČTÚ), said on several occasions that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, has been chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network is apparently not much more likely (at present, he would find only difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a significant price reduction, to which the traditional operators had to react as well.
However, even before the introduction of such disturbances as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual Mobilking operator.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the country's fifth operator.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:phone in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network, which are relatively high.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer calls and good SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers text messages in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as illustrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland, merkering on an unusual target group can also constitute a good deal of publicity.
In fact, this operator is specifically aimed at men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could also be found in us.
Miroslav Čepíký, Vodafone spokesperson: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As far as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the success of this project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very provocative.
Mobilking's launch will take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not been hiding its intention of launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time.
"We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services but also mobile.
And the sooner it'll be the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility several times with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have been able to move forward in the negotiations," said the spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific ones.
For the time being, no subject provided with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová states in a rare agreement with the O2: "We have not recorded for the moment a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate within such a limited timeframe, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Instead Vodafone directs his attention to the fulfilment of requests for his own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýký said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think means most of our customers' inputs.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator meant an increase in competition, would have led to a lower price and thus to a lower profit.
So what good is it to make it easier for such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know what they mean in the fair. The joke accompanying the creation of the U:phone also bears witness to it.
The biggest apparent pressure on the ČTU, during the creation of the U:phone, was the one exercised by the T-Mobile company.
They testify to the information available to the public from the ČTU website.
Today, the U:phone is ready to serve as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "Competitive competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player will be subject, and especially its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems to be disconcerting.
However, this is not only the attitude of the ČTU, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in the economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in view of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible as a result of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the time being, because the offer of potential stakeholders has not given sufficient priority to classical operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of ÚOHS in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of his position on the market, such a statement is more than overwhelming.
As Kristian Chalupa adds: "In addition, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in mobile phone service prices."
However, pressure in the sense of an honest functioning of the market and a price reduction is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is truly shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, resulting from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, is of course raised.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical fuel to all service stations is probably due to the accident and the hard fight against competition.
"The Office has not shown any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none of them have an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," Chalopa stated in her statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTU, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts suggest another vision of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on his network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying about the ÚOHS that three mobile operators occur in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Reconstituting responsibility for ČTU is a fairly common turn in communications, whereby ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to bring about the renewal of the Telecommunications Act, which has recently been adopted, to extend the ČTU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts have promised to improve the situation.
This is something that the representatives of the ÚOHS need to know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work
That said, the operation of some kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own mobile phone prices list, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a matter of firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Personalized mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are generally available only to the electors.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company before the operator is a classic business client, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special offers of prices (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If what you are saying happened, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would consider and that could lead to a halt to the collaboration with the society in question," Martina Kemrová replied to our question regarding this problem.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such an activity will not be achieved to those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator shall, however, object to such a procedure.
In fact, the activities of these firms bring them lasting benefits, and, at the same time, by opposition to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
Moreover, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it in the way of ordinary mobile operators."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTU.
In addition, another question was raised at the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the ÚOHS has relatively large powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea what would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When We Will Not Be the Most Precious Country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators were increasingly, less or less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that in the developed countries, regulatory bodies, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients, were involved.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are dealing with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is being discarded by passing it on to a close target.
As a result of the experience we have, we cannot escape the impression that the confusion in their skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But don't throw the stain after the cognac.
If the information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS can hardly remain unbearable in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national hymen.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech National Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new records of the national hymne Kde homev mój (Where is my country?).
The Hymne was re-registered by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with a heart and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krkek are the authors of the hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhalas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, had a good word, so that we could understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national hymen celebrates next year its 175th anniversary.
The song Kde namv můj held for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the theatre of the states) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), the original Czech piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroop.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national hymen.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" Hymne sounds
The common transport (MHD) will introduce the hole in their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the first passengers will be included in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date when they will get into the subway, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the card is accessible to almost 100 thousand people, owners of the Opencard card.
Passengers can buy a coupon for 30 days or 90 days (this one will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it recorded on their chip map in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Moustek, Nadraží Holesovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letnyany, Kobilisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the Dopravní podnik's web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the tickets in the metro stations, where they had to wait for patience in long queues to get tickets in paper.
In fact, they will purchase their coupon online and will be recorded on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knikhovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is a guy with a trained staff who will help interested people with the purchase of the internet and will also record the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic cuts on Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recalling the machines to compose tickets and passengers have perhaps already noticed them in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be twenty-four," Opatrný added.
An auto will check the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard card and the coupon purchased previously will register itself on the card.
Electronic cuts are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
It is known in the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integravaná dodega (integrated transport of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zone validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, who designs the timetables for the common transit transport.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card readers in the driver's case.
Therefore, when boarding it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered bulkheads, there is nothing more simple than to request this information to the driver," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the periurban buses and will not remember the date of expiry of their coupon can again join the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
This is where information on the validity of their document will be displayed on the display screen.
The Sutes called for a referendum in the United States
The Germans of the South demanded that Shumava be integrated into the United States in 1945.
This comes from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočesská vedecká knikhovna (The Bohème Scientific Library of the South).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the United States of America at least.
In 1945, some groups of Germans from the South addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This comes from, among other things, a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočesská vedecká knikhovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter the American President not to allow "shumavská zupa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - either to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and we really want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come into the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People to whom the fate of the Shumava is at heart."
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is not allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - but of brutality, indifference, ignorance, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take into his hand the protection of the Shumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has contributed nothing to the Allied victory without taking into account the opinion of the four million inhabitants," the letter says.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States expressed doubts about the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his people wanted to be part of the United States, or to live well under the United States patronage.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the history of the post-war war, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sutes of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least consider that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic would be settled, very few of them had such an opportunity.
Some expected the United States and Britain to gain some kind of autonomy for the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms it.
During the war, he was, as a German of Czech Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the English at the end of the war and placed in the capture camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to learn the Czech language.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," says Chalupa.
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that he would not be expelled from the republic as a result of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think about it!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rébíček's office believes that she will discourage drivers from taking dangerous driving.
This costing 150 million campaign will appear on television, on radio, on cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the slogan "blooding" of the whole campaign:
You don't think about it!
The phrase "You don't Think" is written in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of carelessness.
The spots will "maintain" the spectators until 2010.
The Department was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a reduction in the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and fuuture against drivers
"What goes with drivers is the system of sugar and fur.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by earning time, when they grill a red fire.
Fuck, it's the threat of a fine or an accident.
Risks must be recalled to drivers," says Martin Korřán, the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, says psychologist.
The signs of danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert will exchange peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, took the lead in restoring virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must conclude an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupied), even all," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be achieved," he added.
He admits that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all he will not wish that tractors and bulldozers break his feet, as this happened to one of my best friends, should give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted by alluding to the two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of wounded.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he said.
Retirement of Golan's heights
Olmert also supported the retreat of Israel from the Golan highlands, which he believed was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to obtain the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (a Shiite movement); they will have to give up their constant support for Hamas (a Shiite movement), Al-Qaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is forbidden
In the context of the tragic car accident of the Student Agency near Padoue in Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel within the car during the journey.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess was lost, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was then unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the car may have an accident, even abruptly braking, also when the driver serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the car is based on its technical file equipped with standing or not.
If this standing space equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance buses Student Agency have no standing seats; what was confirmed in Aktuální.cz by the director of Radim Jancura.
"It is a matter that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the stewards
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - there is no legal requirement for this role.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement for the carrier to offer services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," says Hanzelka spokesperson more ambiguably.
Josef Pokorny, director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"All depends on the fact that the car has in its approval the permission to offer standing places.
Everything lives there," he says.
Buses are divided into towns, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, interurban with higher parking spaces and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses with the highest permitted maximum speed and seat-based safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Horín, an expert in BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In a regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
There's no doubt when a turbulence and the cough of the air will occur.
"Or, if the car had suddenly stopped, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal requirements," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jancura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession to be a business at risk.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that it's a business at risk, I'll delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their logbook on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The security concern is the reason why there are no stewards in his vehicles, the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have any hosts. We've opposed them since the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Has Come
A young hostess in the Plzeň region, who has been working for society for two years, died in the accident on the line of Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a clinker and blocked the road by the car.
The driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he broke it on his right side.
Jancura refuses that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company has a complaint against the truck driver.
For the benefit of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in the case of financial compensation, it will also rely on the defendant.
An amendment to the law?
No view
An amendment to the Act, which has been being drafted for more than one year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarifications on the movement of drivers on board the bus.
"But she has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the portable to the steering wheel," said expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards as a fundamental threat to passenger safety," concludes Hanzelka spokesperson, stating that the control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and the office for safety at work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfs depend on Frankfurt.
The main words were not missing from the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the household employees.
From a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be, according to the public e-mail made Monday.
WestLB would provide a double "power block" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
In all, such a relationship could be the decisive blow to other concentrations in the Länder's banking sector.
What does this look like when a steering committee intends to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times?
Because WestLB, wounded, is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of the North-West Rhineland that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter of some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, which knew the customers of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported in the presentation of the figures of the late August semester that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deca Board of Directors, each half of which is supported and by the Länder banks and savings fund groups, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
This could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of the financial market.
However, the talks are just beginning, it is said in the financial place.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3000 employees, has one of the most important employers in Frankfurt's financial position, is in the process of consolidating the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it was believed that Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
However, nothing has emerged from this terraneous bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public that the Government of the Land of Hesse had taken a stand against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Then the other two houses did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treaties on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
However, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had decided against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the elections to the Bavarian Parliament have taken place, a union of BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could be achieved first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers should increase, the potential partners will gradually escape.
In the south, she would now be a junior partner, although she had so far resisted the crisis better than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuringe Savings and Turns Group, which has 85 percent of Helaba's capital, drew a glass at the beginning of the year on all the union with WestLB.
It'd be hard on the NorthLB.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one facet.
Another question is how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be drawn up.
In June, Merl would say that the decisive issue, namely, which commercial model should ensure the future capacity of Länder banks, had not so far been resolved by the German group of savings and turnover funds.
In the end, a WestLb detoxification could take place, a detoxification that is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter of the Steering Committee in place: in any case, a ‘global solution’ for the establishment would be addressed.
How will all of this be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta Bank still to be seen?
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied him as a little friend, and so nothing is the same, he said.
Behind them, about a ton of five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival which its taste can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then hugs him.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the road station near the Puorta nouveau station, four buses take the departure at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della brewra', arrived scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loud, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
Buses belong to Marco, which has a long double coat of falsified fur and large silver gowns.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three turns nothing but this year.
They go out at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, broken in accordance with the Bavarian Purity Act, sickness insurance and a responsible German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already running at night on the Autostrada direction ‘Brennero’.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm in the bus, the passengers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates will take another break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the morning the Marco group finally arrives at six o'clock as planned on the parking lot near Theresa, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering together, Marco is holding a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, it's a little yellow casket.
Above is written on the left ‘Feste de la Beer’, in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco’s travel agency `konocersiviaggiando.it".
Second: 'When the doors of the chapter of beer open, we're short,' Marco cried in the morning.
Run! Run and book places at the bottom of the tent.
Don't go ahead, or we'll lock up, and not all the yellow helmets on the same benches, you have to split them into the room!'
The chop, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the delivery!
'Show the security officers that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: 'This night, to be back here is ten hours and half!' Understand?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, some nine of the yellow caskets to the trees to find the way, to the panels and even to an election show from a large Bavarian popular party.
We're supposed to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the "weekend of Italians".
There are no specific figures; there are 50,000 who are on their way across the Alps and are sinking into the beer kiosk, 10% of the visitors would have come directly from Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which produces statistics on countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu Brasserie.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word ‘relatively’ and that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The financing of the Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect themselves from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations were issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hippo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private and public law banks.
In the background, it is Depfa's daughter company that supports the losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve was reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current gains and net gains from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, zero-point gains from the allocation of fixed assets and securities and the resolution of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only thanks to the significant benefits derived from the reimbursement of lower accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies in Group that the deficit of approximately 16 per cent has been moderated.
After privatization in 1990, the former state financial had at first miscalculated on real estate industrial credits, which had then been affiliated to the Aareal bank.
Because classical state funding was not sufficiently cost-effective, Depfa then had a deeper commitment to infrastructure projects and to joint financing of projects between private and State investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Real Estate Hypo must make depreciations that should have an essential material effect on the group's earnings and losses, which is still rather vague.
The fact is that dividends have been amputated.
Already in 2007, they had been arrested by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the purchase of the Deffa, a highly important state investor and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks was once again very expensive, the banks that had accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual share - around EUR 50 billion - of all the funds of the Deffa by a short-term means of refinancing.
According to a communication from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for funding is covered by medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets far beyond its current state of play.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, the Chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer resort to medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for the Monitoring of Financial Services (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors are only waiting for it.
However, given the dynamics and the importance of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not surprising, however, that it does not fail to use the funding in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be avoided.
The fact that the bank is still at the doors of insolvency at the end of the evening, according to the latest communiqués, will not be able to reassure the spirits anymore.
The course of action fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The courses of obligations, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debt to the first chief has barely been moved, second-level loans are falling short.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and those that have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate Bank had previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, and their value should now be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net severity of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that led to the crisis in the establishment by the robbery of the Depfa Bank.
As long as the less affected trading institutions, governments and banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that delays can be made over time.
Or there will be what no one can expect at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability of approaching security today has become a simple founded hope.
This should reserve sleep nights for all long-term creditors to decide whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn to establish a reduction in losses for the next years on the income tax on the capital of the automatically collected stock exchange gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is due for the first day at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new trade log, she is talking about Japan.
"The first day of the course in Japan.
What was I excited about?
I was afraid of going to school by now.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way alone, fortunately I haven't lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as we do in Basse-Saxa.
Students show up after eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the professor, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was for me to introduce myself.
I am not quite like to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet had the uniform of the school, I put on an old mother's underwear, as well as a shirt, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I came to the paper, and I tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to start learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class made all the basses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of the Japanese ad and means "mygnon, Chou".
Then I quickly slipped to my seat.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite quiet, but when the gang resounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, could laugh and asked me many questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My mother-in-law had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really different from the poor German in-houses.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sauces, a confectionery and algae salad, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's safe is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the fresh confectionery salads, bro!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she herself has prepared, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read it in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here as well.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always said:
"That's why I'm so impressed."
After all, reading mangaes, that's what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture that is there, at one point, I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a coward fled in the face of danger, does that mean he feels scared too?
Neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we check that he is trying the same thing when he behaves the same way as we?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address feelings or generally conscience issues, we will enter difficult-to-practice fields because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists derive a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective life to that of difficult animals.
One aspect is that the circuits associated with human conscience almost always include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in management and executive functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primitives and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
So, at least for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including our conscience, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primitives.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence is linked to language, which often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if the conscience was not to depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our consciousness states.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what the consciousness of other animals may be like.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or analysed because of this particular hardware, based on our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be easier to access scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be considered without taking into account their content, and this was precisely what happened in short-term study of the primitive memory, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the Cortex for visualization.
But what's the result of the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the body's reactions) falls into the living memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize the primitives and especially the Man.
Subtle degrees of the feeling, associated with our vulnerable nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impose them on others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that feelings from primitive activities are born in the regions of corporal sensation of Cortex and the brain trunk, as is Jaak Pankseep, who however focuses more on the brain trunk.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human development, it could be fully involved in cross-sectional sensations in all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that is undeclarable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and in rats is probably also felt as well in both cases: how can we still check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A coward ran into danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical vices.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but the cafards do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk at the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this to Man: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably completely different from ours (since human conscience is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress is being made to the point of nervously as the same thing is being done in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could think of this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly clinging to a wall.
I'm actually an emotional pragmatic.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can no longer waste time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA has been watching us all the time."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN is not able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki said of the Polish press agency PAP.
"We have made sure in an e-mail to the President of the UEFA that the preparations of the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been sentenced to compulsory relegation in the previous season; in the end, the League's beginning has even been postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid angry counter-attack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, she talked about her private life in an interview - and now she has some trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her former adult Dennis Quaid.
It emanates - and counter-attacks.
A late Rose War for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid couple: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are delivering themselves to a terrible battle - both in sight and in the south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American InStyle newspaper on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for this stripping of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is a story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his husband's qualification as an unfaithful husband clearly fell: it would be "Monstrueux", he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg replays the history of our relationship and manpower".
It would be even more "suffering", that "the punishment and disturbances that cause a divorce for each child should be re-opened in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So his answer was, "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that goes for the best."
Flight ticket prices and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be profitable - this is the result of a study by the American Express Financial Services and Travel Provider.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities under review by 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities under review.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was mainly in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "flight of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are increased by 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was increasing in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economic-class passengers paid on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-term flights, very fuel-consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of economic-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, business-class and first-class, however, the price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would on the one hand be an ominous economic growth, the firm explains.
The request would be made from the ground in many segments of the travel market by plane.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the "Open Heaven" Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the trend is the removal by airlines of non-profit routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV Bat Gladbach 1:1
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a eleven function.
De Kristoffer Klein. Agrindir. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player will only come into the game late and his shot failed against the target.
His message was clearly formulated, he was out of his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Siffla Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena.
There was not much going on in the clothes, the mid-time was over, and most of them were in their seats.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that is why his application was received at strategic locations.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol has acquired and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach in the head of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders seem to have been similar: and this is missed with this second goal!
The implementation failed.
"It wasn't very nice to see you today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "also been more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit on Mladen Petric's head (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not harm the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a victory room," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate this Monday in 121 years.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's going to be an anniversary without a real party.
"We know what to do," said Marcel Jansen.
It is doubtful that the mid-term result of the table reflects more the unpredictable nature of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from the FC Bayern - is formed quite gently, but it still does not shine.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
On Wall Street, the fear circle.
The first news of the rescue plan failure caused Dow Jones to drop temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, Dow Jones got a little caught up.
About 20h30, the world's most important stock exchange index cost 10,579 points with a five percent reduction.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most devastating of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express that lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could report any more benefits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares charged a decrease of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffet was associated with society.
As part of the rescue plan, funds must be mobilised for the purchase of what is called damaged mortgage paper.
However, the amount must not be paid at any time, but gradually.
On the contrary, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that may be exchanged in relation to the evolution of the course in order to reduce their burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses of action in the tour in Europe and the United States
The billions of help for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investors' concerns.
The course of the action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate melts and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the state's financial market.
The German index (Dax) has led to a profound deficit in the courses of Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank.
The action of the Bavarian real estate finance has now lost three quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has charged a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the significant psychological bar of 6,000 points and costed 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to the knees.
In New York, Wall Street was working with significant losses.
Investors were afraid that the US Government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones 10809,25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first opening hour.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.
The other European scholarships also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index charged a decrease of 3.2 per cent, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index Nikkei fell to 11,743,61 points after an increase of 1.26 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index reached 2.1 per cent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism community has further indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes as they are called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel pipelines, death is a cryogenic threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been the cause of development among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a handle of space probes, by which they obtain an additional wave in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical tool as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected under the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized her the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts were afraid that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of the matter because of the curve of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter for only about ten years.
It appears that it is an attractive force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their rapists, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese shipowners had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to the release, six hostages would have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be initiated.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnappers gluer.
WELT ONLINE accounts for the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Al-Araba Arabic television channel and the Italian media have delivered in concert.
Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian Sky TG 24 television channel bulletins: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants in the trip to the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a gunshot before the hostages were released remain vague: thus, the kidnappers would have been about to put an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six kidnappers without shouting.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent said.
There was no more than collecting hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had slaughtered six of the rebels in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt this Sunday, and two of them had been arrested.
The hostages had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the rapists wanted to free women's hostages after the ransom payment.
The men had to be detained until the predators found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a pretty father who's leading the suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by his grandfather led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight heads of prosecution for misconduct.
The Grand Court of Truro reported that he regularly read his beautiful daughter, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood from 5 to 7 years of age.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was living in Coventry, Treise had tied her up and tied her up before forcing her to commit sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to the Cornwalls.
His beautiful daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer national trust assistant, was subjected to abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that some friends had told me that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the beautiful father of his daughter who had elsewhere, writing a letter of confession that ended up like this: "I regularly associate and bandit."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This disposing saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would certainly be today a happy, promising, and successful young woman."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office's ministerial officer who had forgotten the top secret documents, in June on a train, will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, to the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on his way when he forgot two highly classified documents on a waterloo train.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any intentional insinuation.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the Cabinet," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the Act, that is, of the clause dealing with the protection of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work associated with the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies face B&B.
British construction companies might have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings money, including 59 companies in the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, stated that it is "irritant" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys' mortgages are cleared.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time will be owed, every year, to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that had prudent behaviour... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is announced that each company must pay a proportional amount to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Commercial Committee of Building Societies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "angrily" to see that institutions that had prudent behaviour at the time of the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"we need to examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to evaluate the options to be adopted to avoid that the building companies and their members pay this salt bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could also double.
Since building companies are non-participating organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pounds per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to raise the price in bulk of her milk, from five penny to a litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from an increase in two pennys in February, and is the result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they are going to turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had changed for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has been refused bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application to former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant him his bail because of his examination for having expelled a man of the case, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released under bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh a few weeks ago, but his party, the Avani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government give him full freedom first.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, he could not see why he could not remain free to return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she need no bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country to prepare the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17th, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the military interim government took over power, but was released in June to care for herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the charges they are subject to.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she said that she was unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman stated that despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares by 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unduly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB, parts of ITV, had raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers and regulator Ofcom all opposed this purchase.
BSkyB reiterated that the force to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the release of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"A serious charge of potentially unfounded criminal conduct has not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of the greatest recommendations.
The dispute began by radiation in December 2006 from nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the Department had stated that the prosecutors were licensed for poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the licensed prosecutors were not more critical than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute political connotation to these releases.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
American prosecutors investigate and prosecute the judiciary for the government.
It is certain that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end he resigns.
A number of ministerial officials of the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales's role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first responsible" of these dismissals, and ended by "addicting" his role as leader," which was remarkablely successful not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's spear must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The evening of the price surrender is presented by Coldplay, with this year a limited selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things such as time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly went away
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrument section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was placed on the market in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, in the fifth place.
In addition, his Bat Out of Hell album remained nine years in English rankings, and was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, from his real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his heart beat irregularly, after falling off stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a whale in the vocal cords.
A Street Shadow in the City, Often Forgotten, and Maybe Etre Soon in Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-term local residents don't know how to go to Extra Place because they never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and travels north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty wing rather than an active artery.
No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repeat Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, have said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the pastry of houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Committees of Neighborhood Owners, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay issued a proposal authorising the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee 3.
"There are only few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place" she said.
"They could propose to reinstate and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to renovate the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to re-look at this abandoned passage, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Immobilier Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing also that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small historical print.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a closed rock punk monument in 2006, has reopened to Extra Place; the street is probably more famous thanks to the photo in cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of irons, hails, bars, posters, leaves and cords."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rare - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fixed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: An Amerement Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dark day like night, and bounded by the doors of a rolling iron warehouse and of the Persians, full of newspapers last week that fly along the gouts."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A rat also cuts to the bottom of the street, close to a door that led to the CBGB, and now becomes the seat of a small clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of 22 empty ounces of beer, lies next to newspapers that have just been thrown out.
A few passersby said they thought only rarely at Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on the other hand, said that some under the street thought it was attractive in his current state.
"The best years of my life" he said, "have taken place in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual debate: Entry into English
In this part of the Education Supervision Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you don't think. Why the middle classes must be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr Obama's campaign points out that "African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." This is a true fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr Obama's education programme particularly supports so many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends language-class education other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of Los Angeles.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low income.
More than a third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 maths state review, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language examination of arts
This incredible success was achieved by means of another ingredient that Mr. Obama advanced.
Sixth Street put on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, Linda Mikels, head of the Sixth Street report, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English entry focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Melle Mikels, unlike bilingual education, said, "We had an enormous success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"That walk, does she notice, "it worked for us"
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education, obscured the prediction of Mr Obama's response.
Although it is favourable for immigrants to learn English, Mr Obama recently considered this issue insignificant when he declared that we must all stop arguing about the language law.
"On the contrary, he will declare, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than deconstructing them or treating them as insignificant.
Chute Net of Oil Following the New Concerns of the World of the Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people are afraid that the rescue plan for financial marches could not bring life to the economy.
Gross oil operations dropped by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Stock Exchange, at sales this morning.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 to the barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been run off by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having seen an increase of $145.29 in July, prices fell to almost $90 in the barrel this month, before revitalizing to the deep uncertainties of financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the greatest of all history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that this weekend's frenetic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to revitalize the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"The prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we think that raw materials will not escape this infection.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand until the American virus spreads globally and in particular in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore forced to reduce by 20 per cent the oil and gas prices forecast for 2009.
The Party of the Second Determining Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he saw everything.
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played well under dark clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranus Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, sign a precursor after noon during which their relationship made a bond in advance.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, at 10 seconds of half time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all his passes at Coles.
"it's a poor player."
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing in the trap, the defense beat the fourth back of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards up to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the balloon escape because of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' balloon, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this property for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could have marked in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this madness, said "the second or the third time?"
When he was told that the two Jets had let go of 21 unquestionable points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselasia is resting, beyond its world record.
Hail Gebrselasia, Ethiopian, has again proved to be worthy of her title as the best background runner of the century, after beating her own record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 from a comfortable course on the course, Gebrselasia beat his record at 2:04:26 last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasia won the 26th record of the world of his wonderful career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance of 1600 metres from the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselasia had missed Beijing's Olympic marathon, fearing - it may be exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect weather- sunny weather, 48 degrees at start, 55 at arrival- Gebrselasia won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners such as Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline in the record of marathon over two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, had suffered cramps at the mill two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to stay bright, but not rustled.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
" Everything was perfect.
I was given up last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
In Kenya, the rival is an African of Ethiopia, was accused of having too much orchestrating his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, counting in fact on the books as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselasia's capabilities as a background runner.
On Sunday Gebrselasia, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselasia after the row heads disappeared.
At a little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselasia made her final lift to take off from Kwambai, which ended second in 2:05:36, improving her best personal record in five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing's games because of a bad back mortgage, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record for almost five minutes.
She briefly resorted to a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and Kenyans to take a great advantage, then exceeding them about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus, Kenya, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, just a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, there is a small quiet town where pride and complications of African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black town to integrate, the children's house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make our days." The town with five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 dark skin, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not prison".
She has now become a pilgrimage city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes became tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide edited by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston told me that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's losing".
Even though it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign look.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story" said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has lived in Paris since then and the oldest Parisian city.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and combat.
It is both a historical model of a black power take and a community of nearly 2400 people with twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of South-South black rural culture - some time after which it is called up - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
What would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located right at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
As bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"crossed the road on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well preserved gardens and playgrounds, whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve the passersby.
So, in almost a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a car government but also with anal sex, remarriage, and illiteracy.
Of course, Fodor wasn't.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, quoting colorless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added, "Some people didn't appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston used to come into town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional habits.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told me, while many laughed at her.
"the people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he adds, swinging in his backyard chair that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was definitely baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20s, she was buried in a tomb somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there's no big commemoration, no record for the big audience.
I don't think they understood the contribution or heritage she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment is coming in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to make a five-way highway in town to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main two-way street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville just withdrew from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, including so many other things, has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race mix dispute led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"At that time, a band of white youths came to launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They threw a paste out of their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education as insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black children had the habit of being kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as the head of the Eatonville Community Security Council, a non-profit group.
This lasted, added it, until teachers and students became no longer from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," Melle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many others Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the damage, such as her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they get rid of the pleasure of my company?"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight for his reputation.
Five years later, a biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduced it into American canons.
The highway project came just when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors considered her a savior.
The community started organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the motorway.
"The five-way highway failure, extremely fast, is a real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summed up all the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historical city since 1998.
A mono theme library (known as Hurston) opens in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, refurbished.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be seen as a rear street during a summer rainy day, as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent black today)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
We need to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for the living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for the sincere civil affection to be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins in Winter Park, seem to have learned the description Eatonville correctly.
"Most of the people who go through this area will think, "Oh, this city didn't compare anything to others" Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone is talking finance.
Nevertheless, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bee nests above their heads, the bankers and cover fund managers who monopolies New York , spent the worst "working day at the office" since the 1929 crack.
The suppliers continue to boast on the sidewalks, with their trailers and their muffin plates for morning meetings.
The Latinos are always drawn between residential buildings carrying, like mules, fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make queues to buy their morning sandwiches to traveling merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. per week.
I did not feel the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Luckily, I was planning to work at the end of the afternoon, because I was discovering my local branch office of JP Morgan Chase, a hundred and twenty people making the queue.
Not in front of the cassier's drawers, or to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer's drawer, where the usual customers ordered their Cheques, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers would open accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorised personal banker", all made the queue for the same reason I did.
Not the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They removed their money from their savings accounts called trifles (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and who said to treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank has used the bankruptcy syndicate, and while the New Yorkers would come home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, saving an amount of $440 million, desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, excavated by another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems to them to be reliable, or the one that does the most rescue to Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I understood a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and her poor director general Dick Full, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the concierge in uniform of my building, has changed the subject of our regular conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables market.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Prolonged Muslim graves while Austria is turning right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road panels illustrating red-rayed mosquitoes.
Police accuse extreme right extremists of profaning an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of the political parties of the extreme Right to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun's cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is according to the police, an organized action.
The criminals have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives think that this could have been done to expose the hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesperson of the Islamic local community has said to be "deeply shocked" by the announcement of this defamation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of finding its courage, following its oscillation to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right parties that raised almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the port of the mob and burkas, and even expressed opposition to the food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and mines, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter prohibits travel abroad.
The courts banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to go to Spain through France.
The Police to Kent had granted this prohibition to travel last Thursday after proving to the judges Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse on the child.
Glitter, or by his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's limited court hearing, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson declared " Thursday 25 September to the court of Ashford, the Kent police asked for an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present at the time."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be registered in the list of perpetrators of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may punish up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent police said she would not discuss special cases or possible movements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesperson for the Kent Police said "Kent police will do all they can to protect our children as those from abroad.
"We think it is easier to monitor someone who lives in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"protecting Kent's inhabitants is the most expensive intention for the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those charged with sexual abuse in the region in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, from 10 to 11 years of age, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him in passport control, and finally he left in Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to enter their territory and were therefore forced to leave in Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that they return to England.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge, West London's limited court for registration in the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for holding images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photograph
We don't have any clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the aspect of the relaxation of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at these moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen views of artists who don't care to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixed in "Flamenco - People" theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer repeats the particular iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
Including in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the flamenco, larger each day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" "may be any one but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people who are photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage the passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the instant personality of the flamenco stars."
With the "Popular Chant des Mines" festival, Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a record camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, commemorates classical photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not about dancing or singing itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the audience with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant work that is presented today at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco vettes such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty-ten photographers.
The project turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book on the collection of portraits exposed to the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he worships the portrait of people, knows them and can enter their lives for a longer or less time.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're facing people, characters you sometimes don't know or leave just a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - People", is displayed at the Galerie El Fotómata, located on the number 20 of the street of the Mata (parallel street of the Hercules People) which will be opened until the next 16th October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true courage"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel that has for his main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has been through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize Prize for Literature announced yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it is "a real courage" and that "everything shows that it shouldn't write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I'm hoping to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the Festival of the Exchange of Ideas and Thoughts that for four days he saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people displayed in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to the majority of the participants, won a competition at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, met a fascinating audience who did not see the past time during which Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great amount of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote a "very methodical manner" through an intense work of documentation, by correcting and rewriting a part of the text to deal with his "inspiring weakness"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa said, who said that it "has effects" and "make people less similar", because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to leisure" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather breaks the Pozoblanco fair
The flag festival that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse-towers had verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organization committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather came upon this fair, as at last two parties on the three could not have taken place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
At the show, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's festival took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought in triumph, after making hand movements against the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The very afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the open gradients applauded more than his own struggle with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
When he fought with the second bull, after a much better fight, he sneezed most of the audience.
Police control of a van in Alava province: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Eusskadi police (the Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Arminyón (Alava).
Police officers are arresting two occupants of a van and the latter are taking over.
His load, more than two tons of hachisch, of what to stop them.
Police officers pursued them and arrested one of the two occupying officers, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., according to the information published by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested was charged with drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1 at the border of the Armenian Commune.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, suddenly accelerated and the control started.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres below the bottom, where the two occupants went down to escape into a forested area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch bullets. Then they made their transfer to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the van, that is also why they charged the prisoner with a falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A. J., has been alerted to take the various steps and will be judged within the following hours.
Actor Heather Locklear stopped for driving under the influence of a drug
Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him perform strange maneuvers by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to which a spokesperson from the California police patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness stated that at 4:30 p.m., Locklear "really leaned on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she ran on her sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She had the disoriented air," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we think Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned at 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to care for a nervous depression.
Lamasares requested the Andalusian Federation of the Union Gauche to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The Union Gauche General and Member Gaspar Llamazares said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former counsellor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of conducting favors to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the Union Gauche asked that investigations prove "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Gauche has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all employees".
"Mayo's blood," Garci's ossé pari
By inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's stories, José Luis Garci re-creates the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Mayo's Blood", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, has he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Kim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours," Blood of Mayo » will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid in more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós literature, José Luis Garcia ensures that with this tour "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to play a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story held to national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Community of Madrid is a "single opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the environment of a "Spain that has failed to lead to the fight, as the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellion under the rule of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not getting a funding like for the movies "Captaine Alatriste" or "Goya's ghosts" - more than twice what he got for "Mayo's Blood" - because he couldn't turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which he worked for almost all of his career.
The filmmaker of "Vover started" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he had the habit of repeating before he started the tour and to whom he did not make a casting, as it seemed to him to be "demeanor" and considered that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Mayo Blood" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times as candidates for Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy "Mayo's Blood", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner "The blind turntables", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
Garci doesn't expect a price with this movie.
"At first you think you're working for the poster, and then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," explains Garcia after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the skin of the sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will also pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and of a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and will live in London with his family at the age of three.
It was a free and specialist dance dancer from the eastern dances.
She was a passionate pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who has marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two wars has fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter suggested that I interpret the Sévillana dancer Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we don't try to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of the flamenco.
So, "the papillo dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" at some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she said.
The scene was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: the one by Miguel Poveda who was singing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and the one by Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally well prepared to work with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transform Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The stage was also performed thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arríaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the beatings of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artist who were considered to be divine".
This work also relates, in some ways, the life of this woman who has been displayed in such faraway places, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows or appreciates her work," Bayón says.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre
The publication of the "Newly married poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrative edition of "The Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " arrive at its end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This People of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after having traveled to various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly married poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America please without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "No Malik", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had the pain of getting an Oscar
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a feeling exceeds any expression, and now I've lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and stock markets were afraid, the American estimate fell very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is nothing left for humans but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's enemy and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his deceased old man after an overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had the pain of being forced against a suicide food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration was in Hollywood without paying attention to nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, poor Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy came from Australia, Russell Crowe, who used to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He put us on the top bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle of our day.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for 50 years in Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not miss opportunities to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the event for the 2016 Olympics
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever had.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of a deleterious note.
But let's take a closer look at it from the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of files, which forces you to move forward.
This is not bad, but if they move you, it would be better for them to give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, not.
They only had you down there to take the file (first error, move only for this) and (after a long waiting line) surprised!, there was only the size of the tape (second error, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy that small-size mallows with less fabric and less expensive blow?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that you have to go there very soon to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your bag behind at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long waiting line, the competitions began and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait for more than 40 minutes during which there were riots and strikes in the barracks.
I think that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the knife they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect race example, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the city host for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on Microsoft's Emerging Technologies, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to move into the company's campus) in response to what he was asked to do during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering which posts they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group who is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her she'll answer in a few moments.
All this without the blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
The company now has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about more than a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and there will be no more associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft, after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the Google side to compete on Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the understanding of software and software.
It is the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your stepmother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth but as relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are getting less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only use the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than going through windows.
To whom do half of the applications provided with the system serve?
Who can do the least?
And Windows 7 should contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, month covered, less complex.
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone looks more and more like a computer.
But the Android launch is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them.
Le Fabuleus Marcel
Pablo Picasso placed it on the Azur Coast, Leonardo di Caprio carried it one in Edward Zwick ' s Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in the Francis Ford Coppola ' s Parrain and is part of the holding of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we list all its appearances, we could also mention this Mustachu cost that raised weights in a walking circle.
It's just a man's body muffled in cotton, milling and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flaming name - although he is known as Marcel ' - who has to do with sport because he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinguished from others by his excellent cotton, his unisex cut, his distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that the most well-known body mallows have in the tail.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing clothes designed for the comfort of the undergarments.
Even if it's wrong to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His enormous similarities with his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Sisters Cruz take their new activity very seriously in the fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion made by the Mango brand in Paris at its new social headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prizes of the way the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is hot and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in the honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The film of the 1950s and 1960s is a great source of inspiration for our collections.
I love to dance in town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but at the end of the day, everything goes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was little, I liked my clothes; I'd like to go to my grandmother's house to look into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
Dancers like to dress very well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes, that's where you actually put yourself in the character's skin.
Suddenly, it's all connected.
You haven't been there in 30 years. Was that hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever. My 30s are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asks for it and, more importantly, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and bring him up with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies that you made last year to come out.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I who am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like to have everything now, but of course it is not possible.
I'm looking forward to having the films 'The Last Hour' and 'Seeking the tomb of Christ'.
To see what you're going to think...
A few days ago, you started on the pass with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't look at this!
I'm not up on the gateway to make the mannequin.
Just, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to attend a charity show in London for her association in support of the women and the clothes we displayed - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold to auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, what's so good about Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pier, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
The repeaters of alcohol at the wheel will need to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting the vehicle in a state of gravity, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Road Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the motorists arrested for driving more than once in hibernation, the car resumes.
Alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the dress and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver’s alcohol rate is higher than the permitted one.
Its cost is over EUR 1,000 and is at the driver's charge.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by regular means, but reform by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the Spanish socialist party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Asturias Princes traveled landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the watch to sleep, but its rays were still forced to put their hands in sight so that they could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Oh, well, suddenly we can't go to the airport to get customers at this time... are you here or then...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 Marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very well and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they told her that an orage was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going into the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regolo journalist of Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and better-lived designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Button-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded at a price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in Mango's glass at the 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
It is certainly the second largest brand in Europe that has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the Stylist Valentino, president of the competition board, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With a table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making a good heart against bad luck, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a mango dress and some ELAH pieces, which cut the breath, and arms above, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man nearly two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a male gallant, and the Baron of Rotchil ended the night without a veston because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed by wearing a sexy and black long dress, was excited when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the dance repetitions and recalling the good old time, she seized one of the bars and she made the gesture of a large fold.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us first on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man on his bike – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his drapes, his towels and asking in advance that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to remind them of everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relief to the librarians on September 30.
The morning wakes us almost when it sounds at 7:00 a.m. each morning, but it's even worse when we think about the exciting pace that forces us to live today.
The office is tense and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there is neither one or two ways to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole "menu" of methods adapted to taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled ' 1001 ways to relax ' and will arrive at the libraries directly from editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks that it is not possible to get peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' deduces such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural revenues that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't cut into your veins to restore your body's balance and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talk to Sleeping
Some kids talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens can surprise you, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a blessed change of sleep called sleeploquie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there's more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon may appear in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing more.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (pipi in bed) or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress or overexcited situations.
Anyway, it's a little bit of a study.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or otherwise with screams, tears, long speeches...
Where sleepiloquia becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation of the problem.
We said that it is a blessed change, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another change in sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a sleep apnea or stress).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
Therefore, find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreamers appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember no more than what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's asleep and he's resting.
Remember that if you are very worried several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his mind.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, at the same time pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even fun.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illustrator... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory on his land after a long period of disembarkation.
Without making a big match, the Young and Black have created the greatest number of opportunities and have succeeded in transforming one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting where attackers had had a bad time expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who broke the lucarne on a long shot, Illhaeusern would take the ascendant and tour Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn up, Romain at the end of the foot or Diebold came to the defense of Denmark.
In front, we were blocked in the middle of the ground and just left Riahi to the point of attack.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Denmark, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball based on a first attempt by Diebold (53th).
But the Illhausian butter will not be able to enjoy its happiness for long and will be forced to return the clothes a couple of minutes later and thus leave its equipment in digital inferiority.
But Denmark will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any major problems to an Illhusiaon who just withdrew a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big cascade, the ball passed very close to the crossroads.
Sarkozy at the meeting of angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a tour of Britain.
In view of the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who had severely disrupted the access of several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by British fishermen to obtain measures against the flow of gas prices, which has reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find out about competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and pay for the marines".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out off operations in Morbihan and Calvados, which resulted in holes close to 10 km.
The port of pleasure of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle-Isle did not stop.
A filter barrier has been launched on the island of Quiberon.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets from dawn before the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Loriente, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche facade, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the chalets remained at bay, or in Havre, where twenty ships blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped in the evening the block of the important Donges Total refinery.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting at the Department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by representatives of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up anything" and "will not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorent.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the pipeline, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability threshold of a boat is only to be achieved with a gas shale of less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman's beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes also welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
Brazil's aircraft is a table of 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are planning on the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered devices, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the air carrier delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the American monetary authorities have backed up, plans to give up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was advanced to it, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retired activity in the United States, states the paper that cites close sources of the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met in the evening on Sunday to examine possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision was taken on these transfers, continued by the FT.
AIG must quickly implement liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of US authorities taking 80 per cent of its capital, diluting current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Meeting History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic fall on Monday following the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson Bank Saving Plan: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss never seen near 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had been previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, has allocated 199,61 points to 1,983,73 and the Standard & Poor index 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Banks' Rescue Plan, which was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, with 205 abstentions, the representatives refused the Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"It shows how far the market was in on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not "be too late".
"If the project is actually dead (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would increase the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, a leading economist at Global Insight.
And with more emphasis on the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual failed on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has rapidly accelerated, prompting emergency action to benefit banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, sign that markets are facing "not only an American crisis but a global crisis", the FTN Financial Analyst added.
The compulsory market has grown strongly.
The 10-year-old Treasury debt has declined to 3,632 per cent, compared to 3,827 per cent on Friday night, and the 30-year-old to 4,161 per cent, compared to 4,357 per cent on the watch.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television duel
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, there was another one to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic Campaign QGs announced their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright" enough to allow him to slow down in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll was published on Saturday, gave an advance of five points in Obama (49% versus 44% in McCain), considers that it was the democrat who pulled his corner from the game.
Of the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the well-expected performance of his collister, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"That would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's got good instincts," Bill Clinton said this weekend.
Mr. McCain has had to continue putting forward his indisputable foreign policy experience, while stressing the "neighbority" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused him several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
An angle of attack that has been hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama pointed out that he was the future.
Without disassembly, it became clear and precise.
He has put forward his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, yes," said, this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not taking all the measures of the impact of the crisis on the "American street".
"For the twenty-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama, yesterday, told 20,000 people assembled for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "average class" or "workers."The financial route clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the best way to save the economy on the edge of the rush.
"The coming week could be a decisive turnout," he estimated, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that it would still be possible to reduce taxes of 95 per cent of Americans despite Wall Street's bribes, the Illinois Senator also noted that the achievement of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he wanted to build a 45 nuclear power plant park by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates ignored the financial rescue issues of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents showed Sunday night at the top of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred of Belarus gathered on Sunday evening at the close of the polling stations in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, resignation".
Some agree that they have not even voted: "How good, because they will do what they want from my voice," says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has done good to foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers.
They weren't the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the decommissioning," said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 Presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is that it counts the voices, and in us, it's the executive power.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry to parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and that we do not reform, we risk becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that the number of participation appeared to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26% of the voters in Minsk) had opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You have noticed that there was an election, do you? interview the Social-Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the poll offices.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those who are best placed to do so."
The silence of the night falls on the place of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - From safe blood
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday's 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the world's most secure and effective blood suppliers.
And above all, he regained the confidence of the public that had been seriously shaken by the blood-contaminated scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the greed of the public, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer happen.
While Judge Krever was delaying his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said proudly that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Québec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "confidence is something extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, a new version of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease was seen in Europe when many cases of the human form of the disease of the mad cow, the new version of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, were seen, which has been holding the strong since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports that when we do not know it and that a serious disease can result from it, in the event of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of those who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980 was refused.
But a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the principle of caution applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid tests (TAN) that directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the donor blood and not of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have been able to shorten the mute period, which extends between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This significantly reduced the risk of certain donors being infected without knowledge and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, this will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says the head of Hema-Quebec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It must be constantly monitored," Dr. Décary went on to point out that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which averages only 3 per cent of the Québecs eligible for blood donation."
However, any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria may give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled in a country where malaria is used, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poor people are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and are no longer able to give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them back and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today's life is so tense, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving his blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone graffons, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was considered to be a biomedical waste consists of a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the establishment of our thousandth blood sample of cordon and is planned to take more than a thousand per year.
We should start by offering them for graffiti at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this program of cord blood collection as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," because Hema-Québec has no means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in Half-final
The Impact of Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 total targets) at the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, during the second and final match of the fourth series of goals at the Saputo Stadium.
The center of the field Antonio Ribeiro marked the ultimate goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without purpose on the one hand and on the other, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino field environment marked the other branches of the Montreal training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the return series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle Valley.
The Impact will be measured at the Whitecaps of Vancouver in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder completed a 3-1 deficit in the return game to bring it back 4-3, but the Whitecaps also reached the semi-final 5-4 round in total goals.
The Impact should address the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victory goal of Kovalev
The trio number one of the Canadians is ready to take over the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec collected two aids, and Kovalev harvested a pass in this win, the fourth Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by marking the only purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, Russia has prevented.
I need another match to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He's had a good ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
Instead of the general board of the Liberal Party completed, Jean-Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to elect himself at today's partial election.
"Reinforce the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines, after the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was designed a kind of Moulin to images.
On three huge screens, there were spectacular scenes of hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Québec's "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the election period.
In a press release, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would launch the elections this autumn, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory in the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister simply explained why the North was "a great gem to potential", but did not give time, investment amounts, or priority in future projects.
All but a few avenues of what could be developed more: in particular hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, which is fuelled by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Mr. Charest's census.
This "territory twice as large as France", "it's home to us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Québec has built itself a lot in its relationship with the North, has he stressed: the street towards gold in Abitib, the Quebec engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's for us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Québec's territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, stated the prime minister at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North", he said, speaking of the northwest crossing, which will open all year round because of the ice source.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani Pakistani Member of Ungava), have already started consultations with thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) had an important place of work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerned, ordered and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Prime Minister of the Liberals who had preceded it.
"As the Liberals who have been before us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed re-appointment of the Beauharnois Central in the Adelard-Godbout Barrage.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who made the Pacific Revolution and nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Burrassa who made the Bay of James, our party managed to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he referred to another reference, which preserves that, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its deployment was scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted his militants, bringing them out of their food applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not deviate from the opportunity to start a poll this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, including by a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: PLQ in particular demanded recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wanted Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the main lines of the Northern Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pakistani leader, Pauline Marois, noted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, coming to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "it would have been more advanced today," Mrs. Marois commented next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said Sébastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letter - A Dishonest Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Ironian) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to tell Louise Arbour that she was a "honte" for Canada.
This is the way to appeal to this woman who has fought incessantly for justice and deserves all our admiration as long as the Prime Minister's round as Stephen Harper himself.
We are before a government that is the only one, among all the western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national who is in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no note of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that reproached him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, renounces its word and lets a child soldier be robbed in inhumane conditions.
The only one who refers to a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remind you that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of the Canadian Bar, among other things, advocates for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is now mentally destroyed, no doubt ever after so many years of exaction.
We are not aware of it yet, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", which Harper never ceases to burn and which sounds so loud in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no morale anymore: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a minority leader (which will be after October 14...).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that promotes the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has given up what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devor published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
By pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest auffering company has attempted to continue defamation of six million against three authors and a small edition house without the floor in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions for defamation, but the law.
Without a surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to lead to ruin by anyone or to support a position contrary to his or her own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the book of Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defenses and fight, at very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the bottom of the mine.
In these unequal struggles, however, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendants in order to impose a settlement on the friend who will beat the opposition in addition to exasperating anyone who will hesitate to reconsider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is being done in several countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are usually about the exchange of ideas and not the punching of mattresses.
It was sufficient, therefore, for the miner to open his books, his files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust the public opinion and rejects the petition and letters of support from the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to lawyers who are fat-paid and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada is primarily because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is willing to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not as a result of what many perceive as a prosecution-baillon (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also filed a stay at the Black Canada authors' location in order to stop the use of this term...).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, on the block, the right to quote credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are moving the world's rich businesses into a country like Canada, under repeated prosecutions, who will do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards used by Black Canada's authors.
She has a right to replication.
The university environment, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unbiased pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place mechanisms that limit such abuses.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to halt the financial crisis that has been depleting Wall Street for months must still be maintained by both Houses of Congress.
It provides, inter alia, for better control by the electors of its implementation, for new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money committed, for new arrangements to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, as well as for a right to look at the salaries paid to the directors of the rescued companies.
US Secretary of Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush Administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to open up the real economy and ordinary Americans of the current Wall Street crisis," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, traumatism, chaos and disturbances on American daily life will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last few hours in fear of the effect that would lead to a new failure on investors' mood.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
In late negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election proved to be more favourable to the agreement, but did not express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
Democrat Senator Barack Obama has been awarded the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that to enable owners to keep their home and the salary of the heads of state-rescued companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked about another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The big lines I've read [show] that it's something we're all going to have to digest and with which we're going to be able to move.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is intended to buy with taxpayers' money the suspicious, risky and inventible loans from American financial institutions.
It occurs after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subspecies) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (CCAA) and resulting in a freeze of liquidity and the debandment of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican electors who took over the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to be out of this impasse since the Democrats accepted that some "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only guaranteed by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round up the angles for everyone at Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its deployment.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to be added to 100 other billion if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 other billion should be entered by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive participation in the rescue companies that will benefit from dividends in the event of profit and that it will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the arrest procedures for housing related to the real estate loans concerned, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have green light.
In fact, voices continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the republican and democratic camp.
"Of course Washington doesn't understand you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it's not the one that benefits taxpayers."
Animator of a small group in Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", Democrat representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economic professors, three of them Nobel Prizes, wrote us to say: we are asked not to press and carefully examine the way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas indicated that it had refused to acquire its full-fledged competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (US2.9 billion) in the risk-lending crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not money lost, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that the times are not certain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of Manche, the British government seemed about to nationalize another bank that was maltreated by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would recover all current loans from Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
His beauty in the blue eye was long his map out, none would say his weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor at the charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its powder, its sensitivity and a talent that flowed from source will also have removed it from the register of power that is the child of the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and whose he had long been a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also a messenger of the freedom and breaking up of the dramatic conventions.
Melted blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No self-measured, last quality mark.
Because it was designed by a country full of self-made man, the combatant of the Pacific War, who was injured in the fight, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, television, soon at the cinema.
This same man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the show-business sparks, which will not be completely lost, also disappear with him.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman sought the virtue of filmmakers this weekend, while his great roles on the black screen of memories are intertwined.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parade through it.
They come back to the memory of Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable burning roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, upset at his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, again after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
In the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he will resume his character on the return to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which he valued in 1987 by his only Oscar on nine appointments.
That face through the ages, it was him.
He's still here.
The times are bustling through his path.
Young people know him especially through George Roy Hill's famous Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers in 1994.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish Mafia in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to several legends of the film that soon launched the trade, Newman will remain in the market for long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its pastes and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "as a challenge living in "the underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long fallen all the time in the pool.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginals: nervous, alcoholic, saladed or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals some unknown aspects of his true pudic sensitivity.
His wife, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), and his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role, was drawing an end to a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, working with dust and sadness.
Among the rains of men who reported on Newman yesterday, his great friend and former armed companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very attracted: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, and Hollywood derivatives contestant also disappears.
We will have seen a lot of his blessing reigning on vineyards, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of eating a bad taste, though gag at the start.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be engaged to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to follow the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Citizen model, in sum and on top.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company produce in their invoice factory?
On 8 October, the hearings relating to the current criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
Politicians and their accomplices are accused of crucifixion, in the form of a criminal organization, in a permanent and regular manner, which has caused particularly serious damage. Other accused leaders have been held against them, such as for example, false and the use of false.
According to the prosecutor, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The State and municipalities' money, approximately 65 million HUFs in total, went on one side to the Fiatal Balldal funds and on the other hand to the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices for which no real benefits were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for invoices on the Jozsefváros market, while they were making caches in Kiskunahalas.
For the names of companies to be included in the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposit of the latter, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For its personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices they would introduce, inter alia, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as with the Municipality of Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his associate András 中ri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the necessary files for the grant.
During a "recovery circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövârt Foundation, which will then bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évért, was making some kind of mistake and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in fact only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The bill issuers to the dredging imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name Job Jövârt nor the name of Hoppá did appear, according to the information given to the parquet.
The company manager Farkas said to the hvg.hu website that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed at a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Besides the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, a hundred people lived there, did not wear any more, since this facility only counts eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of invoices were not more informed about the travel agencies in Budapest, which are part of their choice, but only organizing travel abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as shown in the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the benefits of travel activities, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Révfülöp Hotel in the Jobb Jöv ́ért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. In addition, hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while false invoices were written by hand.
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, that the invoice broadcaster could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vice versa, such as types of inadequate invoices and false caches, that invoices issued under the order of Együtt a Harmadi Évérdért Alapítvány of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sports stadium, which both refuse to be the authors of invoices issued on their behalf.
The falsifiers did not pay any attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company refused to issue this invoice.
Bills deliberately established
Another category of invoice issuers is the composition of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialisták, has established an invoice under the order of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évérdért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, Collab Kft.'s manager was forced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices under the Jobb Jöv Õért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenny Õ Egyesület Association, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but after which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this has been avoided by the agencies from mentioning them in their accounts.
The following category of invoice broadcasters is that of the companies directly linked to the accused.
For example, the executive delegate of the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately 18 million HUFs.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian-born man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have obtained documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices in the order of Atlas, Hoppá and Együtt companies at Harmadik Évérdért Alapítvány, and that he seized their counter-value.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian monkeys created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, what the accused explains is that they did not receive work.
He still serves these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as the editor of the company's founding acts, he established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlas and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov has provided companies, 15 total invoices, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generació and Sjövetség Association in Modern Magyarországért introduced a grant application to the socialist party's public utility agency, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for an amount of 500,000 HUF twice, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the Office of Arpád Kemecsei, in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a party of the accused will report the method of manufacturing invoices, as she had already done before the prosecutor.
What might be really interesting would be that the chief accused, János Zuschlag himself, decided to lift the veil throughout the story.
So far, his wishes are not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would wear only the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to be seen, since applications for his residence under surveillance, on the basis of a relief from his conditions of detention, are constantly in the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more serious damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await their own home the end of the procedure.
The psychology of overfill: why do we spend more money?
In the course of the auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in Neurology and Economics at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as a sale to auctions on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These research has tried to develop a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" with the help of sales to experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, while the other group took part in a gaming auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the sale to auctions the essential element of which is the overfill of a third, the whole under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensively at the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
Under these circumstances, three groups met with one partner under different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were getting out of the party, they would receive 15 additional dollars in reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost this money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed on one victory, while on the other, on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the player team "against failure" were available at higher positions than those of the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomena found at the time of sales to auctions but by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by opening up a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York, noted.
Hepatitis: When do we need to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that one hundred miles of hepatitis virus sufferers in Hungary, but only seven miles of treatment follow. This is because patients often do not know they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, salt).
For travellers, it is recommended in any way to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a general malaise, weakness, stomach disease and nausea.
Then, on the skin and on the white of the eye, a visible jaundice develops, the salts become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only one patient in ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to a cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus because the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average of a population of three groups: people who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million people are infected with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advised to consult your doctor who is treating symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be healed if it is detected on time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
On September 30, it is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing the four world-wide diseases.
Its aim is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver caused by the virus, to the causes of its development and to the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article that said researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience by analyzing the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of human being.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument that emits beams and disseminates electroshocks is set on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look closely at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady painted by Leonardo de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would bring up a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during that time received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the painting on a religious theme or the painting on a more general theme.
The Catholics stated that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as if one of whom was "careful" and they "seekly calmed down, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% of pain unless they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the experience himself, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the athletes, provided you find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image in which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and, in many cases, actually change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is no longer any question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonard or a painter of the same scale?
Would the view of a better-quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You're what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that we can find it at the bottom of the pocket of people as much as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centers of interest are.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to the skepticism that parallels Orwell's vision of horror, they do not see exactly the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary for Google’s founders to meet their initial goal, which sounded as follows: “Let’s gather in a system all the world’s information!”.
According to Google's interrogated leader, after ten years of work on global camouflage, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will it be in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best work for me?" However, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simply in the first place, but the day when they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all internet users that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are specifically listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own history of research and can consult what they have looked for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he sees what my job is? asking users, who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not the remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly rebellion against the power that can cause a counter-reaction among internet users.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
The most pressing example of these recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google sent to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing for identification.
Concerned internet users of human rights were able to push a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arms above with the EFF legal protection agency, proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google will not be forced by any of the constitutional points of disclosure of information on the secret request of the FBI, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act several years ago. But finally, it has not been able to obtain the private user search lists, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is frustrated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that they manifest against the proud multinational societies of their conservative image.
During this time, American geek culture and its "saves" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation" by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as the world's invading because of Windows, and that, even though both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its ID users, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the program package, continuously refreshes, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, against the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between the rights of the person and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most famous keyword in recent years, is just behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, that we deliberately leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, where they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can learn from many examples, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the photos of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that licensed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered today.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and this is how the principle behind the behavior of today's young people can be defined.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time leaving no trace intentionally).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not minor. Google online services, passing through text processing to image processing, to read information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, which has existed to this day.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion, or Coca-Cola $110 billion. AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the number of advertising agencies' business, while the benefits introduced at an ever-increasing rate provide serious migrants not only to Microsoft but to many other software creators.
However, critical observers find, besides all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the parent company and after the company has considered the multiple daily restoration to be too honorable, taken at any time. All this seems detracting from the fact that already in 2006, Google acquired before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, the new services are announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will make the world move on new points. While some think that the Google Book and Magazine scan project takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the United States Supreme Court, others will tremble in front of its health system, because in this one, we can build a complete medical profit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good first substance to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with halftonnes orwellin, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an effective way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to eliminate the traces of Ozd's double homicide
"The police have summoned two minors to question them in the Ózd double homicide case. According to the substantiated suspicions, they have helped to eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesperson of the Borsod department.
The young people have acknowledged the facts that they are being accused of being complicit.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telecommunication Agency), are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention that can last up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ozd's double homicide, a young man of the age of 23, was placed in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with pre-medication and interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old man needed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he will attract his creditor, on Wednesday last, in a website of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, who was 9 years old.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes on the crime scene is proof of that.
The police are examining the weapons and the circumstances of their use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish had made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State that wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the stakeholders, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the best new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated from 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent of participations, followed by 14.7 per cent of Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, the European press's leading newspapers are already saying a "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at the end of the day, to bring relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett said, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the broadcaster's mouth in Washington.
According to El Mundo's vision of the newspaper, these are the shortcomings of the political direction down there that led the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, after the congress vote, a real danger, which Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy lies in the void, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place.
We can't ignore the threat any longer - the Geneva Adverts.
Some states may still have a means of rescuing their eligible financial institutions, and through their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks fall into such dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to do little about their national selfishness, and to centralise control over the split financial markets.
On Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hand to the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, on the one hand, the old continent.
The "saviners" must not immediately charge one hundred billion euros, however it would be fair for them to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The smart car imitates the boordon flights
What method would be best to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the imitation of an existing barrier detector in nature?
For example, that one of the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, the Burdon bees gave the strategic idea of starting off at Nissan to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacles detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired auto-robotized control system, of type BR23C, which equipped bee quality, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, in oval form, which, in fact, looks much like our safe protective helmet - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and the brand's technological public relations.
The eye to the face of the bee plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the facet eye, engineers have addressed the idea of the laser telemeter.
He identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which turns it into a control immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a second fraction. Then the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently existing, this avoidr is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and most internal layer of the protection envelope, a layer where collision is considered inevitable for the moment.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in an eyelid.
In contrast to the bees, the difference cannot go upward, downward or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the endless combinations that have the bees to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotating movement, acceleration and slowdown as drivers at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and with a higher energy concentration, making them longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primary, not data processing, and even less storage capacity.
This mechanism should only deal with a few signals coming in a second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers. Thus, it only uses a few dozen kilo-octets of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a giga-octets capacity, or even mega-octets.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology that serves instantaneous avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will make its entry into serially manufactured cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its integration into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, which aims to redeem suspicious bank credits, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during further discussions extending until midnight, Saturday, east-east local time, Congress leaders have agreed on the issues for days and days, around a total of $700 billion in the rescue plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born on the basis of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question here of saving Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy into another direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday night at 8:00 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2:00 p.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the proposal for a law in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Its fate will then be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke in Pelosi, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
In addition, the programme differed from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent at one time for the purchase of securities on suspicious credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the Act by Congress, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase suspicious bank claims, while the use of the $100 billion additional will be left at the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy suspicious claims, securities on suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases may take place as part of an auction sale, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools of concern for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provided the necessary tools to provide $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, that it was a large purchase of suspicious claims, insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or other important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the application of the law as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in bad positions and waiting for State aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called extra-Atlantic gold parachute, to be limited by the government.
The limitation of salaries is mentioned only in specific cases. Furthermore, the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of ceilinging means that if the Treasury secretariat buys from a auction sale, they will collect an excess tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president leaves for retirement.
Directly after the disbursement of suspicious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overrun.
In order for the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing gold parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force on the appointment of the Directors-General - the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State provides a right to buy shares in the banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and the banks saved with it fall back on their pacts.
The bill states that in the coming five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why American citizens have sent us, which does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same who are taking action, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Is there still a need for visas to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the American-Hongo visa-exempt agreement will enter into force. That is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to it, "now everything depends only on the time when the extra-Atlantic electronic input and control systems will be put into service."
At the same time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Condolezza Rice, to whom he will return the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisers from candidates to the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank's rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as well as John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the 700 billion-dollar government's bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of Treasury.
After negotiations on marathons that lasted days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded principle agreements on the bank's rescue plan.
This funding plan, aimed at defusing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama has again managed to obtain some advance. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a collister just after the Republican Convention, was founded.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote the 700 billion-dollar rescue law.
He stressed that the proposal contained consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, industrial sectors as a whole and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
It has not failed to quantify McCain's economic ideas of surpluses.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said: "We will all have trouble hitting it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal referred to the establishment of a Treasury Control Committee and the limitation of the compensation for the departure of senior managers, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role to play in the negotiations, while he was in everyday contact with the Treasury secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there was serious hope that the House would vote on the bill from Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-hand camp is intact, only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is what Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, says.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the red and black coalition.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
In the Internet edition of the German Left Information Magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers."
According to this well-known polytologist, the Erosion of the CSU began well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took on his duties.
Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to happen just ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections of the Bundestag in 2005, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization of "eating its parents", established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
This has been 40 years for sociologists to announce this, but they have been very mistaken about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east in the Bavarian region, in full development, could not remain unaffected by the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization must be accompanied by increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right field is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the independent, artisans, pool holders and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 per cent.
The Press (depresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The presidents of the party are on the reservation against the questions of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused internal policy that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the Conservatives of the EIA.
The EPO prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now all around the coalition; during public-television debates, party leaders were hardly allowed to entertain their cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the PEP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would have imagined a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the VPP, as vice chancellor, remains open on Faymann's side.
As he mentioned, Schüssel-Multererer's orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Many have responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be fruitless if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the VPF.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an entirely open issue, and these points must be debated in the EIA.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"In order to avoid the red and black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, the host of which is France, has begun as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Euro MP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children most and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Group of the Fidesz People's Party, Járóka prevented Roma from losing their job market in addition to the distinctions found in employment.
"A vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher degree of education."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a fundamental right of human being plays a key role when it comes to asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the broadest possible circle, including between Roma and non- Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By their nationality in the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and protected from low quality and sectoral education." - Livia Járóka stressed.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union towards a goal and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the process of decoupling schools, so that compliance with existing and preparatory anti-discrimination directives is of primary importance.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment. We need to give Roma children the opportunity to participate as citizens with full right to the future of Europe," Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised each year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: the grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiable electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been updated.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a 17 percent catastrophic loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the conference of the exceptional party, held last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of this highly criticised couple felt that they were not particularly at their seat.
As a result, they used to calm the angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "bavaroist tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria, giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives are still very strong in this southern region, which is key to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to join the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which started discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Voters, trained along the right values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange foot of fate was that with the help of the list of the Free Voters, the Gabriele Pauli legislation, whose action against Stroiber has served as a possibility for Putsch to be executed by Duo Huber-Beckstein, then to treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without a home.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far taken the stakes in the hives, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the most beloved day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched a few bees to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support on the part of the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defect as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can only be chancellor again if they return on foot in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding its disappointment caused by the failure, the loss of the land of the CSU will not adversely affect the large Berlin coalition.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis is still hard.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivers : 110 - 0
No opposition Member has access to the Belarusian Parliament since Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities when the votes are cast.
The OSCE, after sending 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very much opposed for decades before the elections yesterday, the opposition joining its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would seriously hope that Lukashenko, renewing his presidency for the fourth time during the questionable elections, would "allow" this time the presence of a few Members of the opposition to Parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, depending on Russia's economic growth, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the well-known Belarusian political order of anti-democracy, Lukashenko and several senior politicians did not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit for the reduction of Russian natural gas imports, which was increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior settlement.
On Monday, however, the OSCE communication already contested the campaign, during which the essence of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were cast.
Despite this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper has been considering the two independent territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has started between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch in our paper.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains the case, although "the power in this Parliament was afraid of having no weight, even one opponent".
The opposition does not provide for protests in the light of the results. Instead, it tries to get its message on the need for economic reforms from voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns about this: we have to print our opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us into the wheels for what is broadcast, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older people," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported pensions does not really consider it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'declaring the silence of a cemetery', is no more than a matter of time" - Milinkevich estimates.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers qualified for democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, who led the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds." Thus, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had we had no turning doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the small malinks, against which it will then drink the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-personnel novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The Brunetta-reporting doors are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the Minister said.
Now a new season of accountability and transparency begins.
"It's reformism" is also highlighted by Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the Minister said that "in three months, absences of public employees' disease decreased by 50%, or 60 million workers over a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "of which wage dynamics - explains the minister - have doubled over the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector, and also inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree, which was used in the Codacons.
" while today the Minister of Public Service maintains data on the decline in absence of work on the workplace for the cause of illness - the association of consumers - the people of the "active children" continue to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar contests the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service; the extension of the hours of household stay of the sick worker, during which visits are made, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Cross prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To pay attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian provinces the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the issue of prevention at work," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilites and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continued associative effort to prevent workplace accidents, the protection of workers, assistance to the families of victims and raising awareness of public opinion"
"Of course angry, everyone has hit the point to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, raise the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, even though the everyday reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide but "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to pay attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed how much "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us, and imposes upon all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths being still impressive" said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later.
"We do not wish that this "rebbation" is actually a minor attention, because it is just when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, we are not done enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We have stressed that more checks and inspections are needed, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and so on from school."
- He added - "that further effort should be made with regard to public communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Markandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for the protection of the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "derivative of assistance to which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The aim, then, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee – has he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on the spontaneousism or enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 finger-point reader, they risk hearing.
Listening to full-volume music during an extended period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent injury to the audience.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communication published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - let us read in the note - 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of auditory capacity."
"I am concerned that a number of young people who often use portable musical devices and full-volume mobile phones can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific data - continue the responsibility of Ue - this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise awareness of consumers and make this information public.
In addition, we need to review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can monitor new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise.
"Scientists conclude the Executive U- confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable and similar musical devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of musical devices to 100Db, but concern increases as to the auditory damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, currently exceed the limits for maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interest is 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning in the new seat behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official " stamp of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it will want to highlight Germany - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that political decision-makers will be able to use, which will remain the Committee and the Community Council.
No overposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June-announce the Mayor, we will present the strategic plan of work carried out by the Commission on the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, given that its opinions will not be binding, Germany says: "All depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If there is quality, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as elsewhere in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often policy has been undermined by the management of the daily and urgent events that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see it from the front, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that the Capital expresses.
For Germany, in fact, "a draft of strategic reference is needed, neither firm nor immovable, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit."
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the common borders, but will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass independently wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the basis of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and issued reports (as he still has today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks against Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really cute: he thinks he will win the highest role of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, who all said Obama will win and with good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks to the heart and not the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the suburbs of the South of the United States, wrote an article: once in the voting room, we know very well who the American patriot will give his vote.
Here comes an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, so far that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was returned to its homes at the foot of the cliffs.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to make suitcases.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge point to carry out.
Usa, the economic downfall is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for the removals. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare themselves to the data attachments, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the removals in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public understands it, is not reduced accordingly.
A more complex pessimism has invaded American journalism.
Six out of ten executive seniors and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Published against broadcast.
Journalists don't mind seeing where the web goes.
The biggest publishing houses spread a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to technology hoping to "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest breakthrough in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is related to "security of work".
Directors who intend to lose their 3-year-old job are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a nation such as Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $100,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
With regard to holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, until 15 days at all, a number of years have passed.
But according to their findings, American journalists are often "damaged" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA remains in GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinadu, decided to reject the real estate agent Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his town, Grottaferrata, for a residence in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banking as part of the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During the trial at his office last week, he had obtained the release of a house transformed into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel from the city of the province to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which were not granted by the PM) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that he was accused of.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and is still more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms it by telling us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its vigilant East Coast, moderate, federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, precisely, which has felt despotically with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is not just an example of the changes, the major changes that the current earthquake of economic land presupposes or well lets run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and it can only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are solidified and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary resumption, of the dual category of sovereign state, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with foreign nationals, but which, above all, are largely involved in the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for the government: that is to say how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost here nationally.
Political internationalisation really seems to be out of play or not much to say: clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide any common policy lines.
And so, it is from the government of each State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and rehabilitation plans, new rules, and above all a credit allocation: when we are going through a difficult period, there is only the States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, which no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new focus of the state crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor that is quite linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the kingdom of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, and convinced that the globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have reported on one occasion, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with relatively few material things such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So he who is sovereign has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the evil to live in a place where there is no harvest, no oil and no water.
I now arrive at the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Policy, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergences.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a gap of discretion for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow areas.
In addition, something deeper, in a sense, even worrying: a discretion, suffering, an image of inadequacies, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the different classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having at the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, in a subterranean way, feeds a powerful and branched movement of delegations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in the "unprecedented" electoral revolts or, in the changes in collective humour of the latter, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy was not achieved by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectual credentials, their format, would say someone, have more and more difficulties, which does not date today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and acting in a way that is immeasurable.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "mass revolt" on the agenda, it seems to be quite exaggerated.
But it's good to keep your eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Vain the laws of gravity thanks to a super collar and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
That is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 centimeters, researchers have managed to maintain a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The U.S. journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the hill can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile." explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos patches, covered with microscopic hair that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the glass, the Teflon, and the glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patches of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "is easily removed from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - Berkeley University, California, is also committed to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented a microfibre adhesive like hair, which is self-cleaning of dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Attention to apple juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are dangerous and rich in vitamins, if they are associated with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, in box or fresh, whether they are associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of potato juice, orange and apple juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, canceling their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
The potato juice has already been severely criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS – It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year newsletter, warning physicians and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mixture and to be careful about what to drink, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NO PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by cotton and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of pharmacology at the University of Milan: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informational notes of the drugs.
The illustrative papers of the medicines to be taken should always be read, and, if something is not clear, should not be impressed, but should be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told Ansa.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Cyennesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that has cast off many controversy and that has been blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a very aggressively-style distributor, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is presented to the general public with various new features: the welcome screen, and the revised and austerity interface, to others more important, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to interaction with the Office 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, certain specific functions to some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e-mailing them, or importing PDF files into the graphic processing module, retaining the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create " Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics to the elements of a spreadsheet or a text author.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to perform some of the functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent to the home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is just in business, that the Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Regardless of the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent text video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; and finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the output of the new version, we can even exceed the planned figure.
Kohl, too, is positive, that's the fourth doping case.
New case of positiveness at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's belt.
It's the website of The Team that reports the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Ricardo and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positiveness of Cera, Austria will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The new positiveness of Kohl in the third generation was confirmed by the French anti-doping agency leader Pierre Bordy, who communicated the positiveness to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus renovating the tail of the best climber.
INSTRUCTIONS: NEW YORK TIMES IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as an immigrant country has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" has been reluctantly welcomed.
Would this turn the Beau country into a racist nation? This is what the New York Times is concerned about, which devoted a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originating in Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are both those where more integration and more work are recorded," but also "a strong anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the most important support to the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to stop immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestines is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
A trend highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benoît XVI in Quirinal asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of cheap rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The rental market for students didn't know about the crisis
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, renting a simple room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to exclude the whole categories of young people, the right to study due to the very high global costs that families of origin must support - explains the responsibility of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand of the students has so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, no rental limit, sublocations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax revision are needed to calm prices.
In detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a simple room, we go to a minimum of 650 euros (Black Band area), at an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average cost bed, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in nearby areas of the University, it takes EUR 250/280 for a double bed, and between 370 and 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the nearby areas of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are requested for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
slightly lower values (550 euros for a simple one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We can only save if we move away in peripheral areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes EUR 300/400, for a simple one, it costs between EUR 400 and 600, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, there must be 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, have a further anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30 per cent compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities are clearing up the historic halls.
Historic cinema halls are closed in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates what is happening in the large Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of mono-room consumption in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that we find unelectable and undisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical and memory-sponsored places, "It's like one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a lot of road and so many emotions" observes the actor of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a film that offered to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia in a way of living the cinema, may be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: these past five years, 316 traditional-type cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid mainly the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is headed by 82 single rooms, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that t confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the occurrence of the multiplex, as these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as Emilie-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a farm room in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily ready to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit for traders: the State's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian town, which is concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mary and Anec, the first of which in Italy, to defend and promote mono cinemas in historical and peripheral centers.
The proposed regulations include tax relief measures for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I am pleased to note" by Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is clear, however, that in contrast to the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve sound and image quality, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria SuperCinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema" that I have been thinking of for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I've lived so much with shared emotions, I turn around from the other side to not see the dark panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘andrangethea, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to harmonise Mary's choices in the interests of the Pyromalli clan."
heavy accusations are launched by the Magistrates of the Antimafia Directorate of Calabre, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torreone, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competitions for Mafia Association.
The mannets also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little lawyer's son, the boss's homonymist, already condemned for association of mafia-type villains, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a deal with legal and moral norms, and especially good sense," the prosecutors wrote, both local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"This would have been given to the council - the judges write - to enter officially within the mayors facilitating, already considerable, the control and guidance of the public administration"
The chairman of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee of the Calabres, only hides "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, the heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed those of July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli clan.
By the end of April, the joint council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right-center coalition after the May 2006 rally.
He created the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He accused the vice-minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of having manipulated everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Pyromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
On the basis of the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM writes, "the availability to marry the demands of a business man, representing a more well-known group, near the Pyromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones are now launching.
This is an unmeasured deposit that occupys more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossus like Chevron have put their eyes on, and now they're trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility to obtain energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give rise to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007, that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea waves operating systems.
This quantity would be twice that produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides.
Colosseums on attack.
The first marine energy mining company was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a true revolutionary would have been said.
Two years ago, more and more candidates among these dedicated companies have always put traditional energy on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying technologies on ocean energy" said the spokesperson of a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus, the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and it assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the obtaining of a permit issued by the US Energy Commission, necessary for the implementation of a marine energy operation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that just in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travels the way of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are unknown, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are still talking about technology at its very beginnings, on the one hand, because marine energy does not shed any fear of the ecological impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bubbles connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the bubbles upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
Pressure causes a turbine to turn, which in turn feeds a generator.
Energy is shipped to the shore through cables under the sea.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdan Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six turbines under the New York East River.
The movement of water during tides, turns the pitches of turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verand announced that he had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authority to power.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of sailors at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of the wind, the sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just about the energy of sailors that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look at the coast, invested $7 million in 2008 and expect investments up to 35 million in 2009.
