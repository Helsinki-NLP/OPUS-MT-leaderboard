Good: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian empelt has been launched in Gutach at the village park - in view of the older town hall.
Two installations so close together: intention or shield strike?
This question was clearly answered by Gutachs Mayor yesterday.
"The Rathausample was then installed because it was safe on the school road," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser Ample ensures both bikers and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The facility officially put into operation yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"In the case of high traffic and pedestrians, another lamp had to be brought to their safety," says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements at B 33, approximately 12,000 vehicles per day run the municipality of Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy-duty traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: "Security is just ahead," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were conducted, and a circular traffic was also envisaged, but due to the narrowness of the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was rejected again.
According to Arnold, the location of the lamps was first tested: "We have tested whether these vehicles can run from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without changing the lamps".
The approximately 15 000 Euro expensive lamp system itself is the "modernest thing that exists on the market at present", Arnold explained.
The installation is equipped with colourful LEDs, which are so bright that the lights from the drivers, for example, can be well recognized even in the deep sun.
And it is also expensive: the older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic beat.
If the road is free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver here had to think about it as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the lamp for pedestrians green, a superior-class vehicle emerged through - at bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the insanity of language, the addiction to raw violence and stupendous sexuality, the distress and insanity - have been described by the poet.
The book pricer is known primarily as prosa author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Colllage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "weatherlights on the tongue tip", which is now seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a Colllage from Prosatexts.
The theatremaker combines some elements from the autobiographically marked novel "Der Liebiene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family paying" (2003).
The eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material on the largely empty stage - an important requirement: a zerknautschöft sofa on which it is clearly copied and masturbated.
In doing so, Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overruns the template with a lot of direct attacks, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic gaming forms.
In particular, the actresses come in with some questionable scenarios.
They are hit hard, with their head sunk under water, with their absconding on the wall.
Forced into cellophane or honey, they stick to dangerously high pieces through the stage, either they monologize loudly or completely on the stage floor.
However, the text is rarely used in this hard way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth is enough from Deep Purple to folk music.
Only by the end of the show comes something to rest, and Winkler's absurd humour faded.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and they think they have found the solution in a small black box that finds room in each car’s wardrobe.
The devices that record every run-off kilometres and report the information to the authorities are the main focus of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly led to an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberals have joined environmental groups and have expressed themselves that the government can use the small boxes to record the risk kilometres – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax decisions.
The Tea Party is upset.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while it is not possible to agree on a procedure at Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can change to a system during the next ten years where the driver pays per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we can only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans a record of the lost miles for all California drivers in the federal state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that US Americans set up on the Zapf column, is struggling.
But in America, it's not as much thought as it used to be.
Cars consume less petrol.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians did not dare to raise the tax just to raise one cent at high prices.
"The gas tax is simply not future," says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
His federal state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the long-term most meaningful alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea comes from urban liberals, because for example, the tax has allowed itself to influence the driving behaviour so as to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
The California planners focus on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the federal state of climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees the longest-term alternatives.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay on a delayed route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Directives at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US traffic ministers who, in a 2011 report, had called on the Congress to move towards miles-based accounting.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the initiative and responded to the concerns of parliamentarians from rural areas, who often have to leave many miles on their way to work or to the city every day.
Several states and major cities are still not moving on their own to this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which is one of 17 states' transport ministers on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"Big Brother's concerns and such things were a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a giant, blocked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of federal states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can capture the miles that have been run, but not exactly when and where.
So, like Khan, the public would be calmer as well.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially come to help the federal states in taxing drivers.
Rather, it was her goal to take foot in an emerging market for Kfz insurance, where drivers would pay on the basis of the risk miles.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting to the road planners because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, major errors have been made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose at all a device and instead pay a holiday fee on the basis of the average miles travelled by all the inhabitants of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a taxing device with which parking fees can also be paid, insurance must be paid only for dangerous kilometres and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real time, because of their driver’s condition.
"Car drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole line over payment per mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual fee could be charged to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers care about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfeld: Small team beats up
The Voluntary Firearm attacked her her herb bottom test in spite of personal deficiencies with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
The division commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of the Feder in the Burgberger Straße in his exercise.
There should have been a brief conclusion to the saying.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the case by Hans Kammerer, two air carriers of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead to freedom.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy as it was also a narrow step to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stand for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There were lots of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were still electrical machines for wood processing.
The first reaction was via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was through an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three attacks could be made.
There was also a hole in the building.
Hans Kammmerer was also going to show in the exercise what is to be achieved with little available personnel.
In the event of serious events, support is provided for the Kingsfeld Day Task Force.
The commander was satisfied with the course.
Networking of universities and firms
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also able to explain where the workers come from tomorrow in Titisee-Nestadt.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, he met with the management of the vocational schools and the county gymnasium and the parent counsellor on this important issue.
"Education is an important element of location," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of Hans-Thoma-School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between funding centre, county gym and vocational school centre in the forest city.
He also praised the kindness of his family in the countryside.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but also because of demographic change, the phase of the care of family members," Wolf explained.
He also argued that more and more workers were caring for the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the employer's support, the resulting burden on employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies are often given their knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the president of the country's day.
For only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for expertise be met.
In his opinion, the local advantage of the county circle is its beneficial location in southwest Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his train from Titissee-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Continue to be tough and make public transport better," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
With music experienced a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the Dieting seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
Formerly, the older citizens were held in the Raststalt.
Meanwhile, this afternoon will take place at St. Josef's Hospital.
The natives look forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with frequent melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall is intended to be re-established on the town of Bräunlingen's recovery plan as a prior limitation of the old school on the way to Kirchstraße.
In the days prior to the Kilbig, the first works of the restoration of the former schoolyard built a small corner wall for stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with Balustrade over a hundred years old.
The next step is to include Alexander Misok of the Bräunling City Building, the Landesdenkmalamt in the plans and to create a restoration concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts who are then to be placed on the table for the Community to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is likely to fall in the next year.
After the renovation, plastering and planting of the old school yard within the two side-wings of 1912, the school needs to be refurbished and refurbished as a follow-up to the necessary refurbishment walls.
The historic, one hundred years old boundary wall of the old school yard to the church street is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need for repair and has a bowening ahead.
Deep cracks in individual rocks cause weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger.
A more stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done by the current attachment work.
Initially, even in 2008/2009, school rehabilitation was planned, but high unplanned expenditures led to a shift.
An important word in the historical reform of the school walls, which has already been used for film recordings, will be spoken to the Landesdenkmalamt.
If defaults come from this side, then the city of Brăunlingen hopes for grants from the memorialists.
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now taught again in a well-established old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has also been involved in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up all-round education at the Stuttgart Music School," Özdemir said the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classics belong directly to the Jazz site Stuttgart.
In this way Özdemir, who is in Stuttgart as a favourite for a direct mandate at the Bundestags elections on 22 September, opposes the Green-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it forces a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the students Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music School to the Mannheim Music School.
US border: "Super-Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, researchers have discovered a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel has not yet been used according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," said the U.S. Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it was discovered at the end of the tunnel.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build and try to use such a tunnel, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money".
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against drug cartels.
More than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006.
Designed by experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year ago.
The rail system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is access to a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters into the depths to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the assaulted Marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum penalty for lifelong deprivation, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled into smaller quantities and not through a tunnel.
This shows the "despite" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off," said Bill Sherman from the drug gang DEA in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the detainees, at least one six Mexicans, it was said.
You have to count on prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 will Geisinger Fest year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The repetition of the first authentic mention is getting closer.
When the year ends in good eight weeks, the anniversary is over.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned for the first time in writing.
A certificate was issued in churches where both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official event for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in churches.
Church houses will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July in 1250.
celebrates the celebration.
On Friday with a party, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
This weekend is also the church-house church festival.
Urban music director Rudolf Barth has written for the city on the occasion of the anniversary a contract composition that is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the festival of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of urban music in the new festival hall.
This is completed and dedicated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last week of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee there is also a new chronicle.
"But it should not only become a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but rather a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which is made up of Geisingen, Church-houses, Leipferingen, Aulfingen and Goodmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hangstler.
And also the Geisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the municipalities.
The new Chronicle is then to be presented in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
But 2014 is also another year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8th with a wedding evening due to its 60-year-old existence, the Harmony Goodmadingen will be 90 years old and has the feast banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this within the framework of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift journal owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The certificate was produced in churches (houses), which was then a courtroom.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same licence.
Since 2014 this 1250-year-old is celebrating, in addition there is also the municipal reform 40 years back.
The Council takes the lead in the vision
Whether the rail crossing "Am Hirschen" should be extensively rebuilt in order to increase traffic security
Yes, the municipalities have decided.
Schiltach has to take over 220,000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway route in the coming year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of train crossings - regularly, there are collisions between trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with a third of the costs, the rest share railways and the federation.
Schiltachs Stadtbabameister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the particulars of the pass "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an excursion to the west of the railway track at the height of the tunnel.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting long wood, in counter-traffic traffic without having to block the track.
Therefore, Grißhaber proposed to build a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the road at the given time to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed in the municipality of controversy, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp put the criticism of the critics on the point: "Should we take so much money into account because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicts: The crossing of the railway "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be transported partly through this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the Haverlesbrück because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, Haas argued that the route should not be used by those vehicles which are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked.
In view of the fact that the Churchberg and Schlossberg tunnel had to be rebuilt and repaired, as is currently the case in Wolffag, the crossing of the railway "Am "Hirschen" could also be important for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to examine the costs of the proposed distribution of the road.
Notwithstanding this, the refurbishment of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the measure that the necessary support wall was built so that the city could expand the next road towards "Bahnhofstraße" if necessary for meeting traffic to about 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Gerbei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem, which concerns access to the highly rising "Geroltzhauser road".
The administration had had the railway refurbished from the Breinlinger Engineering Office because it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzshauser road would be possible without further notice.
The investigation led to the conclusion that it was not to be excluded that road conditions could lead to longer-distance vehicles.
In turn, the city is responsible for this.
The reconstruction could therefore lead to disputes of liability.
Since both the wood and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the refurbishment of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
The risk of a collision of the train with an on-road vehicle is also significantly lower than that of the other train crossings, because there is a direct connection between the centre to which there is a good visibility.
Even trains from the main station should be so blocked that no collision threatens.
Mostly, the refurbishment of this crossing was refused because the town of Schiltach had to "wash out" the problem of standing vehicles, so that the councils could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction works.
As an unproblemist, the board considers the refurbishment of the railway crossings "For Heubach" and "For Kuhbach", for which the crossing agreements have already been concluded with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European space agency experts now have to agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years.
30 Proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
If there are at least some of them alive, no one knows.
Selection is hard to find: looking for gravity sources
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are they following earthlike planets and thus perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are directly raised by the European Space Agency's managers.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that are going to make research crucial.
The figure for such "L-missions" is about a billion euros each.
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 The idea was to debate, five of which have now come to the narrower choice.
Numerous bodies discussed the proposals, looking at the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions has been selected by the Esa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 "Cosmic Vision" programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the verbal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, 2017 the space telescope "Cheops" will start with the 500 known planet systems in our closer surroundings.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could paint similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an index for biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also finally be addressed as to what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation that it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in a sample.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a M-class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) on this issue.
The Sun is due to begin in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the Sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moon.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program for this purpose is presented by the Esa.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is going to explore the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The worldall offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that would guide physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come to be, and where does it come from?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Urknall.
In addition to our current matter, from the stars, planets and living things as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity brings together galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the world is accelerating.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the outbreak, nor where dark matter and dark energy existed.
Euclide has already approved here an M mission whose start is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the whole sky and thus enable the creation of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, the best chance of an L-mission is to have a demanding concept for evidence of gravitational waves.
Among other things, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two or three probe-based detector that is stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on the earth, he could also demonstrate gravitational waves that were created at the root and thus provide new insights into the creation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which will explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prim", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will detect and investigate similar planets.
Proposals are already being made for sampling from Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Strabele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, she writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was provenly positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criminalise political opinion with a threat of punishment, where no defense is possible.”
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to leave the charges against him.
The charge raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said regarding time online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German representatives, we will find ways to do this."
The relationship between the United States and Germany is burdened by the allegations that the NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the honourable Member who runs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, explained that the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness should be taken when it is possible to "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Strabele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Strabele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs assurance that he is "safe" there, says the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and continuing" campaign of persecution that had driven him out of his home.
However, he was affected by the global reaction to "my act of political opinion".
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – also in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrollable system of comprehensive supervision as a merit to the general public.
In his letter Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines charges for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to steal handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of handbag and 2 US dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was to be read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the full dose.
The new fee is valid for handbags in the pocket over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that you would calculate $25 when the fee is paid in advance, and $100 in the case of travellers who only paid on the flight.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee was intended to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines started to demand fees for the first and second items of luggage.
Passengers who try to handle these have therefore stopped in the handbag as much as possible, which has the effect that the bags are often filled over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who had made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the section over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight from Frontier may carry a piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would change, so that passengers were informed about the fee before they got to the flight.
The new handbag fee of Frontier will only enter into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often jump over luggage charges and other charges, but airlines are happy to take it back.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many at Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
Most people, however, still leave the fingers of handbag fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested as the first handbag fee three years ago, and later Allegiant Air followed, as well as a cheap flyer.
The only other air carrier with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who follows the additional charges carefully.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the handbag fee is 50 million dollars a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious what he would expect on the flight if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most tireless things I've ever experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see dentists and hand-grieving discussions on the flight path.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding went like wet.”
Frontier also follows spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the full dose and be filled free of charge with coffee.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but it was delayed seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company had been pursued.
Frontiers step to raise fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative to connect customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers directly to them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, borderier has gone as far as possible in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half the number of airline miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight fare booked by a third party with a frontier of more than 1000 miles, therefore customers only enter 250 miles.
Passengers can also book directly on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a faithful customer tribe at his seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The ransom went back by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrunk almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as it is to be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc...
Republic has tried to get Frontier's finances under the company's sale.
Words From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Speaking from the Bible" and "Talkings from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the president of the church council, attended a talk after breakfast on the Biblical terms.
"Speaking words contain life stories, regulations or warnings," she said.
She compared several words with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called words such as: Wooden eyes be watchful, as cups fall from the eyes, and look at someone who gives his eyes to the Lord in sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
On several occasions, the rapporteur also gave advice to her listeners on what kind of speech it was.
The speeches from the Middle Ages were accepted by the church deputies Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something cheerful.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called "the bridge to the past".
Finally, a symbol was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humourfully described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was the mixed mayor's candidate Roman Waisenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for pupils in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who already work as non-industry workers are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and hostels over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with completion," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not therefore be unemployed, the companies would gain skilled professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The industrial and commercial chambers in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel & Hostsättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hacker is the fault on the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency said on the late Friday, an error has left its public website a few hours behind and not hacker, as was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the outcome was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evenings online server trackers were found that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesperson told ABC news that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hackers claimed to have placed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is overloaded with page feeds until the server is overloaded and the website is merged.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose top name was No Search Agency (No such authority), is currently in the light of the public and is seeing the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive monitoring programme in the country and abroad, a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service led to initial speculation that the case today was the result of a targeted Cyprus operation.
The number of people without a job decreased slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 per cent better than last year and even better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy director of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have reacted so far to behaviour in settings.
One reason for this is according to Fielder-Bauer: "We do not have any specialists in handwork, health care and care".
Year-on-year offers have been made again since September for staff in hotel and accommodation.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgüer adgepage of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Earnings at Bombardier after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% decrease in net profits after having been under pressure by falling orders and deliveries to third-quarter aircraft as well as contractual problems in the railway party.
Bombardier with a seat in Montreal also published no flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in the next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
On the young flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, only three further startups have been followed, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price shock of more than eight percent at Toronto's stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his evaluation of “outperform” on “sector performance” on Thursday to the fact that the stock has a limited exchange potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although poorer delivery rates have been expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the marginal development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft advances.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries fleet can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in March and flew after months of delay for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries are now modest as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new passenger vehicle are relevant.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman of the Board Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudin said at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft's standstill was running ground tests and software updates.
Every manufacturer has a different plan.
We have decided to take the first flight and then hang a processing period, whatever we have done.
This happens during the entire flight schedule.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest of which is shortly after, it was called a business page.
Nevertheless, analysts are skeptical whether 12 months after the first customer's flight, a CSeries aircraft can be operated.
Bombardier explained that it will review the deployment planning (EIS) and will update them in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardi's internal planning – reinforces our view that the deployment is shifting to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year ago.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover decreased slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
On 30 September, the Air and Space Contract Office ordered an amount of $32.9 billion, which was unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the field of air and space transport, the results were disappointing within our frameworks, but the low access to procurement and the overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Turnover in the air and space sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this section have increased by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
On September 30th, the share of orders in the Transport Party amounted to $32.6 billion and was slightly increased compared to December 31st.
The volume of profits in the field of transport has been affected by problems of resolution in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share remained 8.5 percent and was at $4.83 Canadian dollars after it was announced that the Google Finance Manager Patrick Pichette will be changed to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's narrowest rival, reported a ten percent decrease in the quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (location time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management reported on the short news service Twitter, the guard was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported the man was dead.
A security man has also been killed.
The media also reported several injured.
US President Barack Obama is currently being informed of the situation, said the spokesperson of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses reported having seen a shield with a gun in one of the outlets, as several media reported.
A traveler told the broadcaster CNN that many people had been looking in panic protection.
Travelers would have yelled and cried children.
Among the waiters panic broke out, many would have been hiding out of fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority has suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
Then he himself was brought into a security area, reported the man.
The shots should be close to a safety control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
On television images were seen driving numerous hospitals and police cars before a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building.
On Twitter, users published photos of a special use command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport manager announced on Twitter, the event began at 9.30 a.m. (location time).
The access roads were blocked and, according to CNN, they formed a long backrest.
Until the air traffic was temporarily stopped on landings, it was said.
However, several pilots were also to be observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles Airport is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss against police investigation must be in prison
Bashart Ditta, 42, gave information on Underworld Size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug search could be discovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Bashart Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminal lawyer named "first-class" with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in his home in 2011, after monitoring the Scarborough police he had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed that Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues were at a lawyer's dinner.
The findings added that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine in his hair, his letter bag and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds in a series of household searches and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Office in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court in two prosecutions after a three-week trial because of the lack of justice.
He gave the cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police discovered in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and there lay the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf shoe under the lawyer's dust tone.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly called with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was announced before the Court that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A in his hair, his letter bag and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but opposed to taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the appropriate dealer because he was his mandate, and claimed that his discussion was subject to the "professor's secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his letter bag and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
In a police interview, he announced that he would call an office and a client at home for legal matters, both under his private address and at the workplace.
It was announced before the Court that he had called for significant arrests and had informed important actors in the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, about what the investigators knew about them.
State Attorney Anne Whyte said: “A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not violated.”
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has become too involved with certain mandates.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these persons.
However, this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the agent.
He had an impact on police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore brought his professional status to the fore.
He was too close to certain candidates, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta showed every misbehaviour and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it right away.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta took the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the time he started to acquire drugs from organised criminals.”
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to collect valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and trust.
Ditta has lost this trust and has tried to bend behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and injustice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to trial.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty-five more persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years in total for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent as an attorney in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and odds inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations due to its 160-year-old existence, the soundtrack Dunningen will frame two services with the "German fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience this spring, the song will enrich two services of God at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. in the service of God in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lakendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Sings for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of birth.
The fair is listed within the framework of the services of God, as the client John Philip Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the band of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skeps soft look
For example, the election of the parishioner 2015 will change fundamentally in the Haslach (SE) mental health unit.
Then there is only one common parish for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschsteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is to the parishes to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the creation towards the new is slow, but in view of a trust.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community, the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the head of the body team were held.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for mental health care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Thereafter, the SE Haslach will form a body of public law that will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches until now.
There will only be a joint parish council and a founding board in which the parish force is represented.
From each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, in which six parishes are formed on the ground.
Your task will be to promote church life in the place.
On the issue of the finances of the individual parish community, there was then a significant need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected goods are to be retained in the parishes.
On the other hand, the obligations go to the whole community.
It is precisely with regard to the large planned investments, whose obligation then affects all parishes, that there was great concern.
"In the past, only projects that were able to be managed by individual parishes alone were invested," said Haslachs, president of the parish of Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes, Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had been assigned to "be one, stay five" and had to find that this was not so easy.
The Haslacher's body was then asked to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish and the practical work of the community teams.
The drafts will be specified in further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, the parishioner Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the mental care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the city manager, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, comes to a four-headed Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 Euros plus cost per year.
The main reason for this price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC turnover from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This conversion will be re-established every year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These refer to the additional costs that come from the energy shift that they can bear by means of a conversion over the electricity price.
The town works Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
The Board of Supervisors of the Energy Company was even based on a higher environment in its forecasts as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the actual payments had to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be closer to the 2 cent.
Lamp on permanent red: Watch on waiting time
Sometimes a lamp just won't be green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
So what do you want to do - drive at red?
If a affected person has waited long enough for a red lamp and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart Lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorcycle".
The waiting period, however, must be "satisfied", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advised to wait at least five minutes before leaving for a malfunction of the lamp.
However, those who continue to travel in spite of red light must be aware that they bear the full blame for an accident caused by it.
If a person has less than five minutes of patience does not wait long under circumstances, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of duration and had to be responsible for a dangerous redhead.
The lamp was not defective, but only slightly later turned to green.
A ban on driving was spared because of the special situation - but not the money penalty.
The municipality is looking forward to a strong budget
Whenever it comes to community meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipality of Herdwang-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debts since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a full success.
This was made clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around €7.6 million was more than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher income tax revenue and the share of the Community in income tax.
The wealth budget was also clear about the planned values.
Instead of EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher contribution from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the rebate is also higher.
Overall, the overall fallout could now be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"So you don't just protect yourself from the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual bill.
He and the communities are looking forward to the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but exactly these good numbers could soon be more expensive for the citizens.
Because of the good financial situation, the congregation in the past was able to give up high rates.
In turn, according to Gerster, subsidies have already been cut from the country more often.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various scales of compensation.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must present certain auctions.
"We need to look at the issue of raising funds as investments for which we would like to be made in the coming years," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Chor
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the Men's Singer Cécilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herb Festival in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singers.
Even after 60 years of singing with the now probably more than the favorite choir still makes great fun for him.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Rapporteur on behalf of the Cécilian Association of Rotterdam-Stuttgart, handed him a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir band as well as a engraved tin counter.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival took place in traditional railways: With the MGV Betra, the Salzstetten songs, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Fullmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of different audiences and singing styles that were held by about 400 visitors.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with moodful songs such as "In the Garden of Wine" and "Suddenly, your brothers".
To her honorary singer Hubert Wermter they prepared a small stand for honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The male singer Betra also sang classical choirs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Wit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Pass Through the Valley".
The Salzstetten songs were arranged with his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impulsory" - for the women's share of the feast.
The mixed choir was led by the Neapolitan peoples "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulsory" also came back into foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What's up with Schwab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts "Bierlied" in the home field where the Fullmaringer Musicverein offered the crowning musical ending.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a Kasperltheater and presented a few stories that the children had been working well on the afternoon.
Children’s Dreams Become True
The children's gardens and day-care facilities in the Zollernalbreis receive post in these days.
The Schwarzwalder Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Zollernalb Sparkasse, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and decoration desires.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Participation in the action may include all kindergartens, day-care facilities and children's cribs from the entire Zollernalnal district.
If you have a desire for construction or decoration for your facility, you can apply for this at the Black Forest Boat.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Children's Garden Building.
A jury consisting of representatives of Black Forest Boats, Bauhaus and Zollernalb savings box, selects three wishes from all shipments.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 Euro and on a day (action).
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many hard builders.
What about the action day and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Zollernalb Savings Box.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press excited about controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves: what does Parliament refuse to do tomorrow simply to abolish judicial independence?" was to be read in the paper which held the draft legislation unconstitutional.
"The law is dramatic and very punishable and we refuse it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be taken forward because it is an extended arm of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star, through the new law, the government took "the media effectively into custody". On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and described the draft as "draconic".
The adoption of the Act is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras on which it was visible how the units sent to the tavern allegedly stole the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the charge was withdrawn after a press call.
Under the new law, media houses can be held with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan skiers and individual journalists with up to one million as well as with the other risks of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court shall also have the right to take over the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “the majority of radio broadcasters can already be forced into bankruptcy”.
In addition, the paper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's 'living blogosphere' description.
If they keep the media quiet, politicians can do whatever they want without impunity.
"No one will ever find out," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation that calls the Kenyan media a critical control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left alone, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Kenyan legislators have raised public concerns.
In May, they agreed to withdraw the reductions ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put back into force their fine fees of around 532,000 shillings free of tax per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will come true for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official ceremony for the art race was not important for the city and the football club.
A more pleasant holiday hour had certainly been desired last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who came without a rain screen or could not hold one for any reason.
That was true of the musicians who framed the feast, just like some speakers.
So we also became FC President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipality, the participating companies and the members of the association who joined.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rustic tenants placed 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new roads.
This remarkable honourary commitment was also appreciated by Land-dag Lieutenant Karl Rombach.
The City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, announced a donation to the Youth Department of the Club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that repeated weather influences in the spring and autumn were so attached to the original breed site that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there was the first discussion to solve the problem when it was thought of building a third place at the football club’s site or at the Real School at the Salinsee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about setting up an art race sports space, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were made two years ago when the FC took over the barn in heredity, committed a cost sharing of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipality decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 at the total cost of EUR 560,000, a fixed lump sum.
The construction of 68 times 108 meters of large art street was started on 4 June.
During the construction phase of more than three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike line.
The Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of internal and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, parliamentary protection and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its consultations.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to put an end to the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide on a double pass.
In the field of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD undermined its no-one to a Pkw-Maut required by the CSU.
A Vignette is a "Flatrate for Multiroads and thus ecologically counterproductive", the SPD negotiator explained on the theme of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of diversion on highways that are already major accidents.
The introduction of a dead for all cars would also be a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be abolished at a later time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The Singing Féhnwelle on the outdoor stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be right again in summer?" Actually, the question was not on the Friday evening at the Killesberg Freilichtbahne.
It was indeed a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for the Battlestar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the image gallery to see the "singing féhnwelle".
Car driver seriously injured in an accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Musch was on his way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempener's outer ring.
When she wanted to turn left on St. Toniser's road, she ignored the car of the 37-year-old.
The caravans were collapsing.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Consistency: Blocking after accident on the dance circle
The accident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove on Thursday evening, 20 a.m., on the left track of the two-legged Richenaustraße out of town.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-wing track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and moved on to the right track.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW running there of 23-year-olds.
The VW pass behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
A total of some 15,000 were injured, the police reported.
The train had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport clears passenger reviews
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Such experiences will no longer exist at Vienna-Swechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the speakers' speeches fall out - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting-up of speeches concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already refusing to make such calls.
Due to the disappearance of these passages - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers in one day - it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual experiences have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight increases or departure times is a bit down here," says Kleemann in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake train with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will begin at 1.30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but are swathed on the cold yard.
Teams and individual combatants are measured in the disciplines of tree trunks, pits and water reservoirs.
Four-and-a-half meters is hard for the tree trunk and 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't go far," says organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be cast down to the right, to be beaten once and then immediately to lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
In the case of capillary, the aim is to be achieved.
From a distance of eight meters it is thrown onto a plock.
Skill and power must be demonstrated by the participants in the water supply of more than 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a botch will be measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two may participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.
The desired is an appropriate dress, for example, the contestants can enter the bulkhead.
But Swabian wear is also allowed.
For "Outfit", the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can log in until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, much action has been said at the detention site on Saturday.
In the evening, the music friends come at their own expense.
At 7:00 p.m., the Schömberg Blasböhmian music is the main entertainment evening.
The chapel plays beautiful Polkas and Maresche.
Its repertoire, however, also includes sensitive waves and a soft big band sound.
With this will be the Heinz Koch from Weilen among the races known as the song-making Weirt and Schwarzwarstbaron.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzenft.
On Sunday, the music club Leinstetten holds breakfast, from 2:00 p.m. the Boffingen Farmer is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the party go off.
The show is already on Friday with DJ Ralf.
Other programme items include the old-timer and trailer meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maeslabyrinth, the Handicraft Market and the sheep cutting.
Specially for children, there is a striegelzoo, Strohhüpfburg, tractor rides (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The eventers are the Förderverein Multi-purposehalle, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Findkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant sauce is, for example, a quartz.
In addition, the Vegetarian Bond is called the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, Yoghurt is replaced by Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, porter, almond or rice milk may be used.
Seizureable plant seed replaces conventional seedlings.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a sharp, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a meal flour milled linen plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Lockers become cheese instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of back powder, a mealspoon of food strength and three dishes of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of Sojayoghurt or Seidentofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800,000 people are currently fed in Germany, i.e. just plant.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached at foot.
There is already a fascinating view of the world-renowned Skyline, which makes a special trip in the evening.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided on the day at the Times Square.
Although Shutdown was able to reach the Statue of Liberty on the second day with a ferry and to climb foot.
Then it went through the financial centre around the Wall Street to the memorial site of September 11.
On the third day, the students from the 373 meters high view platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students now arrive in their host families and experience the school day at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the day of the name of St. Hubertus in the parish of St. Mary on the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertus fair is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the sage after a rather careless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting group of hunters from Westphalia led by Brigitte Kluth musics on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood It) according to old, originally French melodies.
The blouses wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog riders on toe hunting musically.
The festival will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage shines with a new coffee.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu, it is said that Lexicon refers to a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself as having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the same-named café at the sightseeing in the district of Kleve to Rhein-Wal University, it must not remain in the pure feeling of Déjà Vu.
Finally, the café with the nice name has exactly that aim: to make a real stay not only thoughtful but always hand-holdable.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A look at the inside life at stock 8 gives the viewer a good feeling on the inside.
The high-modern but not cool café environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top adorns the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café at the start as a gastronomist: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the warehouse, the sympathetic Café lovers hope more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"Where we have no specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all ages.
About Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathetic owner's pair is behind the coffee-geneus.
Enjoys the smelling hot bread in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Steltt the cappuccino drinker.
"To do this is a baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
Two events were already in the light café.
I'd better say one thing.
Because the port festival was outside - the Café Déja Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a prominent fan of the event evening: "You can't do it all right now".
And with an event I always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception with us.
"We would like to disturb the very normal operation as little as possible."
Should be: Déjà Vu stands for reliability too.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the warehouse in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomic email.
To the joy of many climbs, the guests from close and far away and the students who discover the gastromiles and thus also the Café Déja Vu for themselves.

A day of gratitude at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives were happy to come.
At the club hall of the "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious unity in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the foundation party is also always the appropriate festiveity to carry out honors.
About the special award "Singer of the Year" this time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but you have also turned so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt gratitude," said the chairman of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals through activities were attended this year by the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary president Horst Pier-Ribbert, the president himself, and the last year's "Songer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.
Place five recorded notaries Artur Brückener.
A special thank-you was directed by the board to the team of Vereinswirt Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had decorated an extra-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets at 7.45 p.m. in the club hall.
"New singing voices are welcome at all times," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty.
In the forefront of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of "sustainable development goals", which were to replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated on the summit that the time had come to "think more about national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to engage in an attack to agree on the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will not hesitate to carry out this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been invincible for four days, the handball toplist still has a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon does not doubt it at all.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the Trittliga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet grown trees, Malmon has warned the sign finger in the foreground.
I've trained many players myself in the A-young.
That is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is to be expected that there will still be reinforcement from the first," explains the SG coach.
Finally, in order to get back into the pursuit of success, the Malmon team has to increase in any case compared to the past performances.
In front of all the things in the coverage work and in the switching game, it finally opened up enormously.
There is also a need to improve the use of opportunities.
So I hope that my players finally got their head off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in view of clashes between influential individuals
Thousands of people gathered at the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first President of Mozambique to agree with a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing about the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt with the title "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined her on Thursday at the capital's independence seat.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the government of South Africa and later by the government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but the latest events have upset foreign investors and domestics.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas events ahead of the coast and coal warehouses in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo each other are responsible for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Hochburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The previous rebellions escalated as government troops attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamos spokespersons against the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to lower concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who "deserts all his remaining forces to prove that he can enforce his decisions to the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying, Renamo gave up the 1992 Peace Agreement.
He explained to FT that he felt that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations, but seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have only contributed to the reduction of tensions caused by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who have the heads together," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on election reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to distort movement, to create concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a new party, founded by a former member of Renamo, Movimento Democratáque de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – his resignation when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga says.
It is unclear what capacities Renamo has, but it has taken unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, where Beira is located, using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month, after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga answered the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability has even increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already taken care of corruption, progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country's future and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protestant, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he explained.
Children should be accompanied by myths and legends as "preamps for life", says one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks”, and Arthur’s legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "too much wild, too violent and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools", so Crossley-Holland complained about a "careful selection" of older works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who were "over-didactic" children would "completely shut down", because in entertaining stories the messages would be "unsatisfied".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the fishing-back and was the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British People's Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be illustrated subtly, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansjakob once again pulls in free
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob referred to his age silence in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freeyard".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short play.
From the arrival on the granting of citizenship to his death, the film author and Hansjakobstor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that was very successful under the direction of Cornelius People.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as spokesperson with the ten different scenes, explained links and overcrowded timelines from youth to close retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, in his free space.
And then the scene began where Alois Krafczyk once shined more in his parade than the great son of the city.
Stilecht led with the twins and "Black Forests Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippines welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it unbelievably well to move into the role of the sister and gave her an unhappily life in Mimik and Gestik.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Farmer's band played selected music pieces properly and thus rounded off the performance.
In order to confer the honor of the mayor, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was given the honour which he was expecting in the presence of the then official Hättich together with a part of the council.
Their expectations then led the drekegonig-singer Hansjakob to the call: "How beautiful, then, will young girls live again at my own drekeoning time".
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the open as well as the Storchentag children with their name "Heraus, Out".
His criticism of the official church had at that time expressed his concern about agricultural growth, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeyard, behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene.
Many applause and many words of praise were given by the audience for the performance.
basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The chances of the League's remaining sporty players Ludwigsburg's Bundesliga-Basketballer have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is now less competition for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers rejects an application for a possible back seat.
"We are not going to participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has created the concept of a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first breath from Ludwigsburg, however, was not to be understood.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard process, for so long it has not been established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23rd, uplifter Düsseldorf basketball can submit further documents to the arbitration court and demonstrate its economic viability.
So far, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The evening meal church falls into the point of view
As a contribution from the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office devoted the last of its public themes this year on Sunday, October 27, to the evening meal church.
After the visit of the Atomic Keller Museum, the Haigerlocher was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The Kroner final point is a visit to the evening meal church.
There the leaders get the history of the church building and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Not least in the church is the view of the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original authentic reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Milan model.
The meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at the Atomic Keller Museum at 3 p.m.
There are maps on the chest of the atomic nucleus museum.
For questions and information, the tourism office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum business.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask written questions or personally meet 30-year-olds in Russia.
This was reported by the Agency Interfax in calling on non-closer circles that are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified in an intergovernmental manner, it said.
A snowden's departure from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, threatening snowden there the delivery, it went on.
Longer breath is paid
Six men's teams fought the club's tennis tournament around the title of victory.
In the end the duration of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis division of the sport friends Rohrdorf to the local associations and friends tournament.
The fun of tennis was at the front of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plane, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament was in the successful hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the crucial phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were exactly the same as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Pipe Weiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory event, Carmen Müller was finally able to deliver the hiking podal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Clippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze stairs reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes the successful sound of the tournament took place.
On the last August weekend, the Schwarzwalder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsfarenhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children's hand.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children's and families' party with numerous participations and events.
"Large and small can learn different old crafts on two days," says the press release.
Whether to make soap, rotate candles, make yarns or yarn, for each age is the appropriate one.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 17 p.m.
The museum workshop is also working.
When building cocksuckers, water bikes or circles, the young guests can demonstrate their handcrafted skill.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as push-car racing or stammering.
Speed and coordination are asked here.
For all small detectives, the Freelight Museum offers a guided tour through the Museum on Saturday and Sunday, each at 12 and 14 hours.
At a crossroads, children must consider what stories of the truth are or still lie.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the outdoor museum during a short walk with black forest plants.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which runs its Schabernack from 11 a.m. to the museum guests.
In the meantime, it is pleasant and tender for Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the small guests at 11, 13 and 15 hours with them into the wonderful world of the Marches.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach presents traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, on two events days from 11 a.m. to 17 p.m., numerous handicrafts such as the Besenbander, the Neighbor, the Spinner, the Weberen and the Baker are able to watch over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Even until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors of the Freelight Museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand city, Burt Muro is considered to be a loving kautz because he took part in a race in America with his motorcycle, the year 1920.
Burt is not to be removed from his dream in spite of a heart failure.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he moves by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film, there are coffee, tea and cakes.
Skrille's pipeline disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships into the hold.
The company also has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard puts on wind power logistics.
Black, the coal shines in the warehouse in front of you.
Two powerful blue shields and backloaders distribute or leave the coal here as needed.
Every movement of the transducers emits a shrill warning noise over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are legally prescribed," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmhaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of an unfavorable wind, there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now necessary to keep the warning signals silent with technical measures.
He will also sit on the open dialogue with his neighbors in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has something else ahead of him.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters deep-trip terminal, capesize-bulkcarrier can also be made here for a long time.
"This year we want to knock the 3-million-tonne brand on the siege," says Screall.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant still goes online, 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three shiploads on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism among the basketball players in FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us from believing in winning the best team in Europe in the past two years," balanced Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: basketball exists in Munich too!
At its first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but in the crucial stages they simply did not get clear enough.
The guests first managed to turn the art piece into a 15-point return 13 minutes before the game again turned.
"We fought back incredibly against the double Euroleague champion, but then made slight mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful protestors of the Munichers who had won a clear victory in the first two parties against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish titler Zeilona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, various artists Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays innovation has been expanded, as recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival this year celebrates its ten-year anniversary with more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
“Most of these headings started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were once known to appear in a club,” said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are events by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefit event for military guests in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform.
The festival has also grown the world of Comedy.
A series of comedians that have participated this year in the festival have become known more and more unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was introduced to a cable TV sitcom (the Ironic Fantasy Football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she was the most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on race topics W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up Comedian, but has developed into a prominent television and film director as well as an unofficial Comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the city hall in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks: hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I live here.
Iran is satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows itself satisfied with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear power stationer is satisfied with the negotiation process and optimistic that both sides will finally come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game friends with machete
Two children in Uruguay have witnessed the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited her victim to go to bird hunting with them.
With machetes and knives armed, they destroyed the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played in a working district football in front of their apartments.
The corpse was discovered the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the student who had taken them should say that she was sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl in front of the police described the Tather march without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys agreed to kill the 11-year-old.
For example, the elders called it a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth centre.
Prisoner has to go to prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, bribery, threat, injury and dangerous physical injury, the Land Court has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Federal Defence Army, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, issued a statement in the context of a trial agreement.
Thus, in five cases, he met women about Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to strike after a few weeks against her will.
He maintained resistance to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who had acquired him for some years.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he made contact with women in the outside world.
Together with a colleague who informed the women, he brought them to different brothels in the southwest.
There he let them partially monitor their revenue to control it.
The defendant first claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after his colleagues in Afghanistan joined him in an explosion.
After a mental expert expressed great doubts about the mental restriction and thus indicated a limited guilt, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive opinion.
The court no longer had to understand the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first announcement by telephone monitoring measures.
The hearings were marked by high aggression.
In later arrests, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness with whom one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body has not made a statement to date.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metameter as a normal view.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has got rid of these circles and wants to live a completely normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price is also still falling on Friday, after worrying about a high offer, a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China is changing.
The reference oil range for deliveries in December was 14 cents per barrel in electronic commerce in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange on the late morning at USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cent on Thursday, which meant a drop in prices of 5.8% in October.
The large supply of crude oil has charged prices in the past few weeks.
The U.S. Ministry of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks the offer was increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell on the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court of Justice Blocked Decision on the Stop-and-Frisk Directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a federal court in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program (“stop and search”) of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a call was made.
The judge had decided in August that the city would violate the Constitution in the manner in which the program for the detention and questioning of persons is implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the planned relief measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their Directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension required.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be removed from the case because she had violated the U.S. Judge Code of Conduct by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had reacted to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the rights of tens of thousands of people because they wrongly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot program with cameras worn by the body in areas where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after a police check.
An oral negotiation for the city's vocation is planned after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticised by a number of citizens' rights defenders.
Controls of this type have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls increased during the time of the partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, belonging to all minorities, filed a complaint which developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's Stop-and-Risk Programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and influence how other police presidencies use the regime.
They are opposed to the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also, money would be wasted and the wider problem of a police officer, who was under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of people in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice which was constitutional but only reforming the type of implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
From the happiness of the dreaming camel
Happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the Association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the 10th birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show remarkable success.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the Association.
He himself was the first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheyk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips on site.
During the talks, images were shown from the stakes on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The association's desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former federal border guard.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic installation and is now planning to become a consultant at the association, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Schleeh Room from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a poor district on the outskirts of the capital, in record time of almost one week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be disarrayed.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medic, like Henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Because of the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to undertake as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in different areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent with material to Africa, as in March this year medical devices, medications, compound materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundant local colorite, telling from Mauritania about Mercedes's refurbished vehicles and describing the experiences of the family musicians who traditionally support the association on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When it became clear to him how much money had been lost, he decided to help Africans control a budget through the people.
Fühtel also stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It wasn't far from Africa from Gran Canaria.
Coulson set up phone hacking to check a tip
The previous news of the Word Editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a wrong tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 had a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails and prosecuted them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court heard.
“In the opinion of the public prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the publisher of NotW, is no one who stands in front of people’s apartment and hopes to bury them in a fresh act, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction,” said Edis.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigated: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently he knows from the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking message?
He argues about it, but we say, "And did he know about it?"
News about an affair Clarkes was first picked up by the feature editor of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don’t waste your time; she’s with Charles.”
A band with voicemails from their phone for at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and their sister were stored as "projects".
During the time of the research, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow, which I want to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulsons' activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The swearers heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett was confronted by an affair with a married woman when he himself was with the defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added the phone hacking.
The French football is actually going through the first strike since 1972.
A lightning meeting is going to end in vain.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have been maneuvering themselves into a pocket gas after a failed break-up.
President François Hollande, on Thursday at the Paris Élysée-Palast, welcomed the representatives of the Association and Association and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to release the football from the planned 75-percent fee on revenues of more than one million euros per year, which would pay all companies in the country for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained heartbroken.
The strike announced by the end of November will also be passed, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, shared with him.
Thus, the playdays set between November 29 and December 2 in the League 1 and League 2 fall.
Things: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häßler opened the public information event on the concept of high water protection in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants came to the community hall to explain the measures planned, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Hüßler explained: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipality".
The high water, which went on 15 May 2009, was unprepared, was an intrusive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, Häßler said.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighboring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal," says Häßler.
The planning of the protection against a German weather service is based on statistics for every 100 years to come.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15-percent premium.
In professional circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that led to significant damage in 2009 in gears correspond to a 1000-year-old high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Häßler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, approximately four million euros have to be invested in Gechiningen, with the municipality with national subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Hüßler points out that there is only a promotion when a whole concept is implemented.
This is why the Community is committed to the involvement of the citizens.
An intensive planning and approval procedure has to be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can be started with implementation.
Among other things, the concept of protection already presented in the municipality last week (we reported) provides for local measures under the influence of the Irm River from the valley of Stammheim.
Following the presentation of the High Water Protection Concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was asked why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the responsible engineering office Wood and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that the interaction of all the measures presented is necessary to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, if you want to find the most economical solution, say Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Unfortunately, in the case of people of the old age, who, even in the case of normal weather rains, often have to suffer again and again under an overload of the Canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and first steps have already been taken.
However, Hüßler points out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for high water protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to extend the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year-old rainstorms could be exacerbated.
If we were to scale the water channels larger, millions would sink.
Severe injury after collapse
On the early Friday afternoon, 44 people near Revensdorf were seriously injured in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the street, but at first they could say little about the accident.
However, there are various statements that should first be evaluated.
It is said that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf opposed her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles rolled together, and the woman was so heavy that the firearm took almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both accidents came into nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a Gods seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Surprisingly the relationship in the outside: the dazzling eyes, the bart, the high stellar.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski and his massive Oeuvre are to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who applies something in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes in the second millennium.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security waves and faith, to be selected.
Dick had God's experiences, his later books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, they had put drugs in his brain.
He's got an early understanding that the computers are deities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person differs from a machine, the Creator from his Creator.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" comes from 1956, and it spreads the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is as scary as ours, look at mutants into the future - and the police access.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll get them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And, "In our society, there are no serious criminals; for that we have a criminal-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-scene-s-scene-s-scene-
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being implemented.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terrorism laws and the NSA's hearing.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's Drone Philosophy and Practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls the day-to-day - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself will be monitored and a future crime will be committed.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own requirements.
Not only does he accept wrongs and sacrifices but he builds on them.
The system creates the danger that it fights.
Philip K. Dick reading means getting closer and closer to the truth.
Smashing deal about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case in the U.S. Army Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Court could either ask written questions or personally meet 30-year-olds in Russia, the Agency said.
In the past, the Greens-United States member of the Hans-Christian Strabele met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
Strengthen NSA disclosures for state monitoring
On a mild day at the end of August, a German policeman flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the request of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Combating Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted that the United States did not use the possibility of foreign espionage to "steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to enhance their international competitiveness or their profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become the Whistleblower's united employee, has begun publishing his fullhorn into U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the Director to the floor.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought company paranoia to a new peak due to state monitoring.
The passage to the pass brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been connected, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to enter the visa, business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it's probable that this data is used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMI, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States is now at almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by the consulting company EY.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents provided by Snowden that the United States has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
The Bundestag was proposed that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“It doesn’t work that way,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have killed it 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything up to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, extensive and technical refinements of the US spy authorities discovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
There is a major change in cloud computing because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to the law and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of the non-United States members of the U.S. plans to use an American provider were rejected after disclosures of the US data mining activities.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this area?”
Many German company leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be watched for every price.
Economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always been like this.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, president of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company usually does not care about the countermeasures that have been taken, as this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies employees have long been inflated to say that taking a free USB stick at a fair or the unwarranted location of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the Board of Directors at Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid handles when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handles will be discarded later.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to protect business secrets effectively from unauthorised access," warns the BVT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel were classified as two of the countries serving to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German Blue Chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Home Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very well that all countries, even if working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: The fair provides answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration came about, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The retro look has kept up.
This starts with the wedding dressers.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
Before they are often dressed and dressed with stickers, often with a loop, on the other hand, they go down the back and often end in a loop.
However, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house dresser müller.
In men the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen creamy or brown combinations.
It is important that the selection of the location has been explained.
Unprecedented side rooms are not optimal, the environment should be especially.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the Remise.
Whoever then wants to go ahead with the Kutsche has an offer for Uwe Link.
"But kisses are also popular for boy cell lines," he says.
Romantics is also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more fashionable are the "After-Wedding-Photo" - that is, series of recordings in special places, preferably water cases, a few days after the party, but in wedding dress, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, the guests can maintain stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
It's all for an unforgettable party.
Dog friend successfully
Repeatedly, the athletes of the dog friend bitz were successful on a rally-observance tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley brought it to twelve with 87 points.
Susi Hopp presented herself with her Woody in Class 1 with the critical views of the performance director.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolling ring mat in his high school tournament, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a well-established matte behind the Tribune in the educational hall.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old hesitated.
“They are convinced that her son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They'd never believed he died as the sheriff had.
"They believe that it breaks every logic, violates the laws of physics as well as against the healthy human mind," says Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth would be obscured in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back in the bodybag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there was going to be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "position-related collision".
A second autopsy, however, gave rise to another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will be commissioned by the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the county sheriff's office was not ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a South Georgia Court ruled that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC publishes school allergy guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with child food allergies in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The distribution of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the body and employees and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrine – the self-injection of the EpiPen brand is used most often – in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The federal legislators have recently amended the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more readily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is scratched."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "uncertain sex"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children who were born with indistinct genitalia.
Newborns are no longer considered rigid male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but may indicate "undetermined" or "unspecified" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make overtime decisions in relation to operations for gender allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm staying the girlwork created by doctors, confused and full of scars.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children come to the world every year, neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual differentiation disorder” (SDD), a collection concept for people with atypical chromosomes, cymbals (ovaries or heads) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a determination is not possible and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding for an operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds after a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
You can make a gender allocation without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersexuals are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but depends on their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both simultaneously or clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statura, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender persons are exposed to in-service life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudicial crime.
Not with the sex image boys now have a special camp.
It is now possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex".
In June, Australia's Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court had granted the lifelong retention of a "unspecified" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German presentations have a third assignment, X for intersexual purposes, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, on the basis of which: “If the world is shaken into a new state, where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it was better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"The parenting is also stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parent's website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as Hermachhrodites, after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the gender to be something that can be deleted and then rebuilt.
Meanwhile, however, the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned, as it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when raising with the gender assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’”, Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeons.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with indistinct genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, which presented the view that the sex could be formed.
He identified the term "sex identity" and argued, social and environmental attacks – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and suggested whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/John" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He begged the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from him during a perfunctory cutting, to cast the child completely and also to remove his head and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a change that he was not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations joined the public who are "unhappy with the result".
For example, at Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but two-digit genitals.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and his head were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity again, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him fruitless.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice in California, ensures that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a "not determined" to the child," she said.
We fear that this will favour interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because "it enables adults to recognize as a third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to which young children should be forced at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast doctor who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "powerful" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor deficiency of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no egg stick.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the children's psychiatry.
Although it is fruitless, however, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make overtime decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to do an operation that can't be undone anymore.
"This puts children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the gender that best suits him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown injured girls by shooting from car
Unknown ones have injured a 12-year-old in a car in Sachsen-Anhalt.
On Thursday evening, the perpetrators had probably fired an air-pressure gun at a group of children.
That was shared by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left side.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed to a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they left.
The criminal police found it on Friday.
So far, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to child-rearing, who threw them against household facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the eggs immediately, there should also be no damage to the property.
Furthermore, some silver cylinders were also burned in the city area, but also here there was no damage.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer Road reported that his car was wrapped in cloth paper and his radar blinds were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man had discovered his radar blinds in close proximity all again, so the police did not have to continue working.
Living with a perspective of the future
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives wonderfully.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"Do you hope you're not afraid of spins?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows you a fat spin on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinning phobia, but the worry of being able to handle the many steps to the house at age and in the apartment no longer, she explains.
In addition, since a menikus operation, the mid-five-year-old has had to learn about her own body, which means moving with a handicap from a floorwork to a floorwork.
Recently, a book of her published on the topic 'Lucky Living in the Age - What is the best form of living for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't even go at age', it begins to tell.
When she and her husband moved to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in the mid-50s, Waltraud Ries is thinking about it differently.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all involved with the topic 'Living in Age'.
Most people push it as long as they can.
It's always only the others' old age, she says.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great can you think.
'Then it may be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-defined living at age.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the country's language, you also gather in the Dolce Vita,' the expert bookwrote.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At the age of everyone has his ticks and hooks
'But it wouldn't be such a living community for me,' she says with an eyelid.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'At age you just need his back spaces,' says Ries.
The fact that a senior housing community can still work, however, does not want to exclude the bookwriter.
However, this had to be different from that of the classical students WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, she thinks.
With this view, at least she is not alone in the capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as possible,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service living at the age of the capital.
Its service advises people about the topic of 'ging older'.
Therefore, even older people would often also buy discomforts and restrictions just to be able to stay in their usual surroundings, which is also the experience of the Foundation Wartest.
Today there are many ways to create the house or apartment without barriers.
Ries recommends that all those who are involved in the old-fashioned reconstruction of their home or apartment should first inform themselves thoroughly and not order the best craftsmen.
Today there are also old-fashioned conversion specialists.
Even in the apartment it is possible to realize one or other, and if it is only the toilet lift, the interior architecture clears up.
But it is not always possible to renovate the existing apartment by age and thus create barriers, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
Even if you could install a stairway lift within the apartment, the path that is also patched with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it is more gray than before the spin on her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude towards former US intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be asked to disclose confidential information.
Therefore, he had to face a criminal trial in the United States, said the spokesman of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even the recent expressions of snowden would not change that.
The German Green politician Hans-Christian Strabele had previously appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in the case of harsh statements it was the one who was a parliamentarian and not the German member of the government.
The secret service provider Edward Snowden is generally willing to speak with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This made clear in an unaddressed letter the former NSA employee wanted by the United States, published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Federal Day and the Federal Attorney General.
The letter shall read as follows:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your survey for mass monitoring.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously employed by the United States' National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government which made me act morally.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hatred that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying a time-bound asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the revelations of a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These spying revelations drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming more and more clear; at the same time, the risks that have been bought have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been provenly positive, my Government continues to treat this as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political opinion.
Yet to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will maintain this abstention.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are encountered, I will be able to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legal.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Strøbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterling.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipality agreed to the sale at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owners to a "advanced" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was set at 100,000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer has to come up for the house's entertainment, as to heat, look at the garden and clear the way.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high-summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammer Reisisenbach offers a concert on the terrace of Hammer's guesthouse.
When conductor Bianca Willmann has the tattstock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners are pleased with the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped successfully to cope with the first musical hack.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing prayers by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book that will soon appear, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisors had conducted "large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's hope of re-election seems better if he let his prayers fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national correspondent of the Times, the book fundamentally describes the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House to measure, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, what effect it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice Presidents.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former members of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
“Double Down” claims that Daley was at the top of his efforts to exchange prayer despite her “close personal relationship” before deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton’s candidate would not “improve Obama’s chances significantly”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually decided to replace Beden by Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "God's will, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "supply care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign, considerable effort had been made to find out if such a train would be paid in respect of the elections.
"There is not much money spent in campaigns for surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former Chief of Staff said that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political polls had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn't know any of the investigations about whether to let prayers fall during the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an e-mail.
Was the e-mail in the design of the Internet service similar to the one in the traditional mail technically translated?
The concept of early Internet services was primarily designed to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not respect the creation of a stable basis for a more secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a common e-mail corresponds rather to an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
Anna's email program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content with his provider.
Will regular e-mails be read on their way through the web?
Most of the mails are read by software robots on the way.
In the case of the sender's provider, the mail is usually checked to see if the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a boring and unwanted spam mail that is either deleted or sorted into a spam folder at least.
Do the robots still have another job?
In the case of systems such as GMail, the robot also identifies the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benny communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can include corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized people are reading a mail is extremely low.
But theoretically, that's possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to receive e-mails or be aware of them.
In addition, there are possible illegal exodus actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against read.
With high technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to identify without any further who has communicated with.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a survey by Convios Consulting of August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the most privately used postal sectors.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail were most recently liked, GMail was able to significantly add to Google.
Mother in the forest tightened and paid rent
When his beloved mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and still paid her rent and maintenance.
In order to continue to pay rent and maintenance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
At first, he had considered the death of the 89-year-olds, and then he had spent more than half a year on the money.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, the mother in need no longer needed medication.
The investigator told the tenant that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officials found this strange, they further determined.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had been the last to care for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy did not provide grounds for a capital crime.
Want ice cream that lights in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first lighting ice in the dark – with the help of whales.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the sea otters and created a brilliant flavor.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on whales and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thereby increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you lick it, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights up.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it on the market to Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because it's four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good for it.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leafy gold.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and impossible for itself because of the light break caused by the ice crystals, from which ice cream consists; but I suspect we will find an opportunity to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a whale that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six days.
Calculated now it will come tomorrow for the Ingo Ehlers team to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers says optimistically.
Finally, with the exception of the permanent injured hendrik Blohme, he has available his complete frame.
Daverden also puts us on a tempo game.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
However, first of all, it is worth increasing in the coverage, which has left everything else than a safe impression.
It is much more relaxed for Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz after the first season victory against the North Horn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to stay in Morsum to start a series.
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-young Joost Windhouse, which is active with double-playing rights in the A-young Federalist HC Bremen, celebrates its season debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
I'm more of a Halloween muffler today.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute out of my apartment from sweets, and it will probably not be this year either.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep with respect to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween, then again, is the trend.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year there are exciting unfavorable objects of the last cry.
Women no longer need to wear sexy clothing, they can now also incorporate seductive food such as pizza, burgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-World Dreams will make it into Instagram feed this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for the costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As far as sweetness is concerned, we are not zimperical.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, Lutschers, Bonbons and Gums.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce is that 41 million people are going through the area with the word "sweet or healthy".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't want to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is candy Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it will be sold for Halloween, says the National Association of Sweetware Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve yet.
There's nothing more to Halloween than houses where it smells.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spy houses in the United States that deliver $500 million, says America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and put the friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the type on which you're standing leaves a comment like "netting facial expression".
But we're finally getting to the cones.
Charlie Brown made us feel familiar with the Great Rabbit when we were children, and the cutting of a crow blade is like the decoration of Christmas tree – something we made from small.
Fortunately, the baby's trend began last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to correct the baby and not to sit there.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on sausages, says the U.S. Census Bureau.
The vertebrates, which are slowly rotted in the front yard, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of vertebrates were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut some pretty hairs out of their 921 kilos heavy.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains cold bodies
The firearm had to express itself in Helmrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof will catch fire on Friday night.
The rescue forces mount a frozen body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmrechts, rescue forces found a frozen body in a three-family house.
Whether it's about a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening, it burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm came in, the flames were already knocked out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
First of all, the building is no longer inhabited.
The exact reason for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest Landeskirkche has launched an offensive to recruit for the Pastor's profession.
Background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover estimates that its current number of 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halfed by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work- and day-care course itself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to inspire young people for the theology study.
At present, less and less young people choose to study theology after the Abitur.
Burfien brings this back to the process of defamation: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession of great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my timetable and can place my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be as soul-caretakers close to people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly more will be paid in the free economy, but the theologians would have been a safe employer.
This is true of young people today who are not just about their careers but about a full - time job.
According to the Landeskirche, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently going to rest each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicaria.
In thin populated areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien, among other things, wants to organize studies for young people and also invite prominent people who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a free speech facility.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as for an affordable way to world class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format provides new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare new people for the Strapas and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenges – this will be a entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day for the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firearm for the rescue of a dog, which fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a stone breach
Cockerpaniel-Hündin Ruby was released after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the stone breach in her evil position
Firefighters set off on a rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firearm was able to secure a cane that was fixed on a 15-metre promenade in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerpaniel-Hündin Ruby was released after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a stone breach on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom belongs to the dog, came to the rock break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were desperate for their missing dog and published aid in social networks when it was released after the small traffic accident in the stone breach.
At 2:15 p.m. on the Wednesday, a walker saw his dog running, the beached Ruby on the 15-metre high paragraph in the rock break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station took over and went off to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dogbox.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move any muscle during her rescue – she was as frozen as hard.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue team specialist, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was given to a veterinarian for testing, but nothing was found except extraction and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Seeing salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them in their arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the production was too large and it was broken down, it would probably be ruined.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really brave what they had done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explained that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer for Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker at night and that "he had me behind when I was 18".
She added, “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever made an attempt to get closer to Katy Perry".
The representative added: “Maybe she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on Anhieb on place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European detachment gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we will warn that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the password for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a secure border along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not play a role in the battle lines.
Neither has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often apply their strict rules when it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small confession to what you really want from the Scottish people.
So it's not really a story.
And one that has come so far over the years that it already resembles a fossil: for the first time, I have heard the "independence means passport checks" sequence at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why does the London Joch exchange against Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the big post-war plan for the unification of Europe is on the ground.
With the Euro-crisis, the project has officially died in Europe.
All over the EU, parties will win land that is EU-enemy or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to raise almost five million votes in the September federal election and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is becoming a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket that requires the national economy to hold the single currency, many people think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devalued local currency, South Europe will again be able to find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.
The only option is to reduce wages and public expenditure – sponsored by Berlin.
The current state and currency problems have led to a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a louding cost disadvantage, as we've already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage-fixing writings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt will emerge, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was kept in check and Paris was raised to eye height with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has expressed its own economic policy to combat the French economy.
The result is that Marine Le Pens, the EU-enemy Front National, has just won a decisive reelection and thus referred the ruling socialists to three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her new popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to remove an anti-EU anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut down well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go beyond this: in the near future, the growing resonance with the EU and the single currency will be brought together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the 'Europe of the (supernational) nations' that favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific is that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I believe that Scotland could be in a more relaxed European Union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries, similar to thought countries, is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway equal and our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) cuts that were due to the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to get a savings policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: grow faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already seven or eight years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatrician endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents – normally this is not a sign that puberty is entering quickly," Kaplowitz explained.
Visual displays of development, such as growing breasts, sham and shoulder hair as well as body smell, show themselves to girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift at the age of the Menarche (the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also the author of the book "The Early Puberty of Girls: the essential advisor to dealing with this frequent problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is 'early' when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth shift of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can monitor exactly.
In the case of faster progress, tests may be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are methods of treatment for delaying early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: the early aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is resistant to drugs, but he admits: “The depression of puberty can soften the behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, other than their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They take care of the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene site," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter got her ten days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be genuine.
Boys like girls come to puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz is the view that the most convincing prizes are the epidemic of obesity.
He supported a study in 2001 on girls between six and nine years of age, creating a relationship between body fat and admission to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be influenced by early puberty from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already growing facial and ashamed, the trend towards a full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shamaar is spread even among babies and small children.
"We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their child’s doctor about how they should talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected," says Kalowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a disagreement about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-distance flights, which indicates the tone of a bitter crash at Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the width of the seat offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who make the most of their efforts, but this proven space is the key to efficiency claims for the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus this week demanded a industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Erzrivale Boeing says the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft owners compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and record orders are expected from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats, it is crucial for the stated economic results to deliver the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" has 406 people sitting in the tourist class who are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share lifts over technical details by advertising in the press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to run directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and the donors showed a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant and the title: "Would you accept it?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are less than regional turbo props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
In view of changed nutritional habits, people are becoming thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and by the end of the century the weight of the average American male has increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the US Ministry of Health.
The size of the male average American in the 21st century according to US health statistics is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival held a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing argues with Airbus's figures at headquarters and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance air fares and arrangement.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
“It is really up to airlines to give flexibility so that they can do what they need to do in order to be successful,” explains flight crew expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it will increasingly be a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US$700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the sitzlayout is the driving force behind the conflict around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat for their latest two-engine long-distance design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitting Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeings on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore quetches more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full of ten seats per row at existing 777s, pointed out that many passengers chose the closer arrangement, which could result in cheaper flight fares.
"The 18th Customs Seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, an expert on cabin facilities, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-renowned Jet sellers even wear band sizes to measure the installation in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with tens of rows, but has not yet sold anyone according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed how important the adaptability of the cabins is and for some jets has offered wide seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call will probably be consummated according to a new industry standard, but could deviate from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotinic vaccine may make smoking enjoyable
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine enabled mice to protect a long life from nicotine.
Before testing on humans, further tests are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine greed is stronger than these approaches”, says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience any nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice treated with nicotine were kept at normal activity levels.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a "time off", the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could, if he is sure, be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"Then they know: When they start smoking again, they no longer find pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to overcome the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time cautioned that further research was needed.
Tripodi argued to be influenced by Obed
Against the former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by State corruption supervision.
The former NSW Minister argues that the regulations on maritime pollution have changed at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who held hidden holdings in three properties in a state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (IAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various state ministers accordingly to enter into Circular Quay contracts, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without extending the invitation to tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, due to the accusation, Tripodi knew of Obed's hidden interest in the property, after Tripodis had expressed his interest in former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In the years of talks which began in 2005, the government had insisted on public tenders for the contracts.
The bakers were opposed and wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, contracts were extended for companies at Circular Quay, which submitted the Obeids annually $2.5 million, without public tendering.
Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally spoke for public tenders.
However, he argues that he has made changes to the requests of Obed, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced a reorganization of the regimes of the government.
One of the ICA's telephone subscriptions from August to September 2007 showed talks between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who was transferred to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"What is the topic discussed in this telephone conversation about the development of commercial settlement arrangements?" asked Commission member Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target at the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, confirming a leading government employee against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was the goal of Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already launched air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to a 'reality test'
In the context of extended measures, the Government is thinking of a "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is to be introduced, it should be subject to a criterion to be used to prevent the use of 457 to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for accessing family and friends to Australia.
Today, a discussion proposal was published by the Government after the previous Members of the Laboratory Party, Maxine McKew, who had condemned the Government's comments on foreign workers because they could be considered as insulting by the neighbours of Australia.
“High declarations such as ‘foreign countries’ and ‘Australia’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market’, she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to ridicule an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures that were once envisaged by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who spoke yesterday about trafficking in human beings in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, and the others will still be considered.
If the "reality criterion" is taken over, then someone applying for a visa could be checked as to whether "the application is true in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the subsidiary."
In addition, companies could be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after they finally set up hundreds of companies in the past who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum worker probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the island of Christmas.
The nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him will be cared for by an adult cousin since his father died on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and Northern England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "would bring Britain closer together".
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2 has ended, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Scotland transport, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further road capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of at least three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on him to use himself "indistinctly" for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection provides the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also provides Scotland's economic power with an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to explore options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, to benefit everyone and to complement the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to jointly decide the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing, despite efforts in the United States to unlock the arrangements for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their standards so that passengers can read e-books, see videos or play on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
While most passengers are already allowed to do this, many people are angry that they cannot read their e-books when they start and land.
However, Australian companies have observed that the decision to implement US airlines does not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Aviation Insurance Authority also explained that the announcement will be seen, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA has currently no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it was stated.
The topic is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already led discussions with the CASA on an extension of his Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explained that you should be open to changes, but should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Quantas explained that you will remain until further notice of the current rules.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices must not be used when starting and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change this," the company said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly see the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision is different for US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the malfunctions by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbag programs and customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use more portable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases when the crew is poorly viewed, the crew will show the passengers to turn off the devices while landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment should be stolen under the seat or in the areas above the seat when starting and landing.
In front of the Ververderby against Schalke, accompanied BVB trailers had provided lighttrackers for hideous scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football league against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spontaneous acoustic that was offered to the viewer until just before the beginning of the federal league game between the German Vizemeister Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
The guests were mostly listening with their songs.
On the other hand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans first presented themselves exceptionally quiet: no songs, no fights.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint leadership, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the Tribune, a big flag with the title "Station Ban Section" was worn.
Only as a torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, short-term jubilee burned up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and crying noises - but not anywhere.
Nothing happened in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern triangle.
Even that the spokesperson Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by Coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for holiday pay.
Only five minutes before the beginning of the season, the Capo came to an end - and until then the tension with his hands was revealed in a loud scream when the mood on the ranks of the stadium as usual was questioned.
Finally, as always, the southern tribune was on the line - and finally was here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, as with anpfiff from the southern tribune, the loud call "Derbysier stands up" came, everything was again as always.
The silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Directly before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the traveling BVB trailers had lighted in the eyebrows and on the spot - and almost torhüter Roman Weidenfields.
The game was played late because of the chaotic scenes.
The BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and it is believed that Watzke's words were a rather uncomfortable date for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the whole ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prevented the Ultras a choreography for home play against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnic matters.
In addition, the Ultras have shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of the next week.
"That's going to be cutting," insured Watzke.
You can be excited about how the reactions to the South Tribune turn out.
Farmhouses boom in Singapore, as the crisis has reached in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, ring and a pair of earrings at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, where my whole money is in," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 each month (about € 1,730) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, her monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt increases – is so great that ValueMax, where she has exchanged, this week became the third house listed at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The commitment of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, homes in Singapore require an effective 17 percent anniversary, which is just above the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, housekeepers offer the advantage that there is no need to check creditworthiness or income, so loans are faster than banks are possible.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to homes after families feel pressure from increasing living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with smaller and medium-income households are seeking to compensate for the difference between large economies.
This week the rating agency referred to Standard & Poor's growing financial debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, according to the Agency, the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which has recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued export deficit and a legacy of consumer demand.
"In the final effect this means that in view of increasing costs, people will be trying to supplement their income in the middle to bottom segment (the income scale) wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks at gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend towards the binding of personal objects, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, there are about 70 percent of the items committed in the 200 homes of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain tied up and get it back next month."
The largest Thai parent company, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% customer increase in its branches in recent months.
The growth in parent business is so strong that ValueMax, a branch manager in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances it with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the exchange in Singapore.
While some lenders have gone to crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that houses not only offer more favourable interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase the debt.
"Customers lend items they already own, and the liquid personal items do not increase the budgetary burden," she explains.
The parent loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure financing.
Also, not all people who use parent loans are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to secure gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include benefactors who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies who have to break the strains in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-increasing NSA spa business.
Following the presentation of Mr Ströbele's Green-Friendly-Counsel, at his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was under what conditions would be expressed by the former civil servants at a German State Prosecutor's Office or in front of a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Strabele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health
The Australian government is under the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health sector to ensure that the government of the federal state cannot spend the money.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to reverse a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher proportion of chronic diseases and system constraints.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut down an emergency relief package that we consider to be the unique challenges facing the federal state," said Plibersec today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars immediate aid for election services.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, will eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launcheston, better after-stay care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinical staff have told me they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister was on a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Government of Tasmania.
The Federal State had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-pronged Commission will be set up to ensure that the Federal State provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would only benefit slightly if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he commended the government for having responded to his call for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a big contribution to taking the state's public health system from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these elections will be largely the subject of recent cuts.
But the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is only a "flash solution".
"We are therefore in a position today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government takes almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth has 300 million in and then does as good as the good news.
Dutton called on Plibersec to ensure that no single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nickoux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also more expensive than necessary.
The action taken in France in the 1760s tells the fascinating story of Suzanne, a young eagle sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and is the object of another's erotic fascination.

The festive seriousness with which the film is told also makes him the curator for the public.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition production facilities, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious clashes near one of the sites where potentially toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed just three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date
1 November, which had been established in The Hague by Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, the experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as reported by the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Britain.
On Thursday, 120,296 people died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 disarmed soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them abroad.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights underline the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons station is a race against the time in the middle of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing/fill facilities mentioned by Syria and has survived its destruction.”
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two institutions, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites were “disposed ... and that the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were moved to other establishments that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I draw the attention to the courage and courage that you have shown in meeting the most challenging mission performed by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzuumcu, Director General of the OPCW, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For three years now, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have fought against the Assad government and its security forces, many of which belong to the Alawites, to separate Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over judgment for bombers of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002 reacted in anger at the verdict of the last of the founders who had been brought before the court, as Umar Patek should be shot permanently.
Patek, who has been on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing of the bomb to a 20-year prison sentence.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a charge was made in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor had asked for a lifelong sentence, even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, was also referred to as "Demoliation Man".
The decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the destruction set up by Patek and his co-sponsors almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek would have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy.
"We should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so I won't get another single and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 a.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked before the club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds ago a suicide killer blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for a month and died three times after the attack, while he was hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were set up four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty first and foremost.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds, there is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to stand before the court.
He retired almost a decade of detention, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US fighters killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet my demands to re-establish the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand up," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no regret about how much suffering he has added to other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Flight guests can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but no phone calls)
Flights can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using the viewing of films, but not phone calls, so the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, on the other hand, from the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the arrangements for the disposal of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"According to the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently passengers must switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may only start again if the aircraft has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain has green light.
When entering the country flight, the passengers must switch them off again and must not start again until the aircraft has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the devices also when starting, landing and on the runway, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Air Operators, welcomed the changes.
"If the new scheme is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it," Glading commented.
We are truly sorry to have to feel as vigilant as regards this issue.
However, Internet connections to surf, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not a "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight.
And heavier devices such as laptops still have to be stolen, as there is a danger of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices at startup and landing
Last month Mark Rosenker said from the National Transportation Safety Board, security experts for national transport issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem not only because they could cause potential interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also interfere with transmitters," Rosenker said.
A consultation committee of the industry, convened by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to release restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become widespread.
In some studies, the speech that up to one third of the passengers forgets or ignores the switch off the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air traffic controllers in 1966, after reports of interference with navigation and communication devices were made known by UKW radios carried by passengers, which at the time represented the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they are not affected by electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices according to the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally give significantly less radio radiation than before generations.
E-reader, for example, only emits minimal radiation when you re-bleach.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the defendants of a lockdown of the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company employees launched a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to find problems, but could not find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers said he was the view that the interference with the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only single reports from pilots who are talking about disrupting aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order, in the event of instrument landing, under poor visibility, the closure of the equipment by passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as sensible adjustment for travellers who would be widely equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Birds rescued by North Sea Bohrinsel are released by air rescue service
A bird flying off the coast of the air rescue service, which has been found on a North Sea drilling island, has been released into the wild again.
The waterwheel was flew last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was launched by the Scottish Animal Protection Organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the Centre, said: “This watercourse was probably a winter train from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the island.
He added: “He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the help request.”
At her release, the water roller was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who want to change our relations with the EU in Britain for prosperity and work.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 economic leaders, representing, for example, British sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while states are stagnant in the EU.
They hope that new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be promoted by the Government, rather than the long and pressing process of reforming the inconsistency of EU institutions.
In their view, the majority of economic leaders are interested in certain legally regulated issues – from cartel law to product law – which should be returned to Westminster to control these key competences.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, since according to the company, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European Trade Area – even 40 percent of the major companies were in favour of those traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that is probably the case, our survey by economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain is seeking a course towards amendment of the agreement and not a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade.
This recognition, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a "reasonable change" that brings the burden of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion for the rest of the EU in a referendum by 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of British terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations from a renegotiation to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which means that companies have a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom called Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas station
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work in the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom, Chairman of the Management Board, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes across Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its pendant in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides for an increased risk of conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "always" excluded.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the whole project is operational in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other downstream countries will begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Economic framework data are correct and funding opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9. real estate of the stock exchange.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been accused of sexual offences in relation to children, before the 2011 Child Caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah was charged with allegations of child sexual abuse by the Royal Commission.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that "there has never been any sexual abuse of children in the organization".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee was accused of having committed child pornography and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of abuse of his trusted children in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, an assistant lawyer from the Commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there were external inspections of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as the front of child safety".
The evidence before the Commission shows, however, that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-rate assessment of four possible quality audits of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had failed to "from behind me" when setting up Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Directives.
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys at the beginning of the year for sexual misconduct during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem which the employee had prevented from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, treated them privately as babysitters, let them sit on his shot, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chairman was Lord and who had prayed for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Child Service Director Jacqui Barnat, who was the Lord's prime minister in the YMCA Caringbah, was “very frightened and most of the time was very unbearable”.
The manager explained that he would not accept statements by employees, which they had not trusted in in order to repay their principal.
Instead, he said, rather, her friendship with Lord had affected her judgmental powers, why they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he had informed the YMCA NSW's board of directors that the lesson the organization had to learn from the "Jonathan Lord's incident" concerned "not the reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to force the employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the indictments occurred was taken by the manager of the YMCA Children's Services Liam Whitley.
He said that in order to prevent contamination of the evidence, however, it was 'transgressive' and was misappropriated.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was busy there between 2009 and 2011, not being a safe organization for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, review, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his resignation from the office, 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided speaking to British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as a envoy of the Quartet of the Middle East peace founders.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, I am sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse-show experts found themselves in a crowd in Cardiff in order to celebrate the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was taking place.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who was not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago, took his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee came loose through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving 30 adults behind.
The unbreakable couple, both equally large, were praised for their performance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he set up his counters in a rough corner and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony, who are far above his age.
And Toffee got the best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March and has been practicing with Shetland Pony since every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great strain."
They had to go against the entire field of participation and went off the square with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been leading horses for more than ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like an electrician, and they all set him on fire and rocked him.”
He went on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so small, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
As he started, it won't take long until he's on the "horse of the year" show – and I'm sure he'll be fine.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead.
They looked after good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed to this, which was really perfect for the occasion.
The Chinese newspaper is to be "reformed" after its call
A Chinese newspaper, which on the title had demanded the release of a reporter charged with defamation, was to be reformed, a press regulator explained.
The New Express in Guangzhou had a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bailouts in order to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
The new expression will now be subject to a "wide correction", the regulatory authority explained.
The "Reforming Order" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several unmatched reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that she had decided to "enforce an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license".
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete rehabilitation of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant responsible for the New Express and to immediately review the new Express's management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and placed himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said against the State broadcaster CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and explained that it was neglected to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently posted opinions on television.
Experts say that opinions are still forced on a regular basis, despite a change of law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Discovered drug tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railways, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimeter measuring tunnel as one of the most elaborate passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses that make it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men, according to the authorities, who worked as a driver, were charged for the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You are threatened with imprisonment in a guilty language between ten years and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers place on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eight large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana Erte in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Players Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still loved each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Artist Orlando Bloom has spoken for the separation of his wife, Top Model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who should be broadcast on Friday (location time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and himself still loved each other, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, her son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to Vegetarianism, but it is quite different from that.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to consume safnets, ice or a strong edamer, these badgers are not on a Vegan's food map.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the meat and fish refusal, the Veganer leaves off all animal products - honey is also destroyed.
What remains may be asked, but in closer consideration the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable amount of influence.
"Brotoupstrike is very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the home reform house, which provides a variety of special products for Veganer.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand vegan has lived, in Lampertheim he will find (almost) everything he needs to live. "1997 I killed my diet and became a vegetarian".
About the turn of the century, the next step took, and I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of food, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the art leather prefers normal leather.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor the maximum of the vegans, which extends to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of repatriating burgers, pipers or rubber miners, the Vegan quickly discovered new products, and the enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually vegan does not make up for it, it does not make up for asceticism, but it's an areaization." The assumption that with the food change reduces the selection of food options leads Proctor to the power of habituality.
And exactly these conditions also caused some to fail such well-meaning attempts.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, just like smoking," Proctor presents a comparison.
And apply: "Some tasters are not to be found on the animal."
Often it is the spices or the kind of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
Proctor, for example, brings aubergines, champignons and also a few vegan herbs.
He takes note of a balanced, varied diet, where it should even taste delicious once.
Of course you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but this is not only to reduce to animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed on vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often get checked," said Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn about the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are fed with feed instead of grass on the grass, it is questionable whether in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 fraction is high," says Proctor.
For Veganer there is also the possibility to take coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Far away, Proctor must not go for the food purchase.
There is also basic food everywhere and every supermarket has sojamilch and other products.
Everything I need is on site.
I'm just buying something special.
"Many people ignore the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is also known for "normal" finished products".
Nevertheless, the preparation of vegan courts is far more favourable and less time-consuming than usual.
"There is much to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knuckles you can do well if you don't get some better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more back powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor could also bring his parents to the barn.
Family parties give the Vegan a new flavor.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that may arise in this are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already subjected to skepticism.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"If I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act like a Veganer with fingertips.
"I don't deny the people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to delay the enclavendasine.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear to be as vegan-like as suspected - and the Vegan does not appear to be as limited in everyday life as usual.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's potatoes everywhere!
"Many gift stores offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he turns off pasta dishes, or orders just a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about this.
"When I started feeding myself with vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can discover a development: "You have to talk to people about it."
"If enough questions come, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants are developing, such as the vans in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfree.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan court on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are available for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat is exclusive, and in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then Veganism is a safe way to make most of the above impossible," says Proctor.
Buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in earthnuts as a coloring agent, then it seems to leave the courage quickly with the pursuit of ethics in so many ferrets and falls.
Not only has Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients, the food- but also cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to watch "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stand," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger that hits the consciousness.
He may not be able to completely abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues its customers in breath.
The sale of the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon by German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business uninterrupted.
The latest case continues a whole series of smaller and larger stakes with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August this year, there were two sticks alone in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent massively wrong purchase orders to options markets due to technical problems.
Then the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to browse and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the United States was due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for several hours.
In addition, in the last year, Facebook's stock exchange had taken care of.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flow of purchase and sales orders, later determined the stock exchange supervision SEC and divided the company into a record penalty of $10 million.
Constant: Radler carries 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, 22 a.m., with a lady's bike on the left track from the station to the market.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly came from a local on the road, the bicycle driver was no longer able to brake in time, according to the police.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the next course and pulled a wall about 15 centimeters long on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police issue a delivery note
The British police today handed over a letter of delivery to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had been given an order "to stand up" that called for him to appear in a police guard, and added that he should not follow him, threatening him to be arrested.
Assange threatens to transfer to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual deliberation after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its objection to the issue at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "an older man 40 years old invited him to attend a time selected by us at a police station," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the provision of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spying proposals after he published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks' website.
A driver with 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs will receive a penalty of £1,000
A penalty of £1,000 was imposed on a driver because he was driven with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27, with his Mercedes Benz at A120 at Braintree.
After he was arrested by the police, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Court of Justice Colchester, Howie was guilty of not taking the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying costs of £90 as well as an offer of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had in the budget 2012 a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who keep the apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The income from the Stamp Tax for Housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were at 708 million pounds in the fiscal year 2012/13, is already higher than the income for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against a treatment, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low to be taxed, regardless of the effects of the old community tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more resistant to the purchase of real estate in London or to the sale of its owners,” he added.
First-class properties – the highest five to ten percent of the apartment market at price – in the prosperous South West London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have earned 11.8% of the record last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market on which the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context of a dog's tailing with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were turning more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left-hand side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well-known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli, causing positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs just like in humans the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side tailing of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the tail once moves to one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a naturalized version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and so we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or the right.”
When the animals saw how another voiceless dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But the swing was mainly to the left (from the dog's perspective, which fades), so their heart rate rose and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, what movements they should worry about, and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the swinging with the tail is more linked to friendly behavior and the right-hand side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to improve the understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Healing at Bristol University, explained that this was not the first study in which it was examined whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year a team at Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their head left when they see an aggressive dog and right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research work at Victoria University in Canada, the following was: “Dolls go to a robot dog if he’s “swanz” on the left and not on the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could result in dogs in the various studies not interpreting the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception”, says Bradshaw.
Since your behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys move appearances in Glasgow due to Alex Turners' disease
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys moved a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer was diagnosed with cholfungal inflammation.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be postponed.
The announcement of the band came after having had to move an event in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight, as well as on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with cholera fever, which is why he cannot occur.”
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on 20 November, which was placed in the hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets are reserved for this show validity.
We apologize for the inconveniences caused by this.
Please contact the customer service at the place where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis named in February the first Cardinals
Pope Francis will be called for new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also those who choose a pope, so that Francis will be named the first group of men who will eventually be involved in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope’s election – this is true of a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican speaker, said, there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals, which is also known as the Consistorium.
"Papst Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably be reduced by February.
He explained that a pope would normally take as many cardinals as is necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals would be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wanted.
The Consistency next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, says Valero.
At present, there is a certain overlap between Europe and Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will call Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called upon since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "very possible" that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called from great places to cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he is".
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks with the Year of Construction 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat, a communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on Vehicle Safety in the case of head restraints.
“When driving from the rear to the vehicle, it is possible that head restraints are not properly protected so there is an increased risk of injury”, the message was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The returned models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks started in June and is the main starting point for the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owner in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter due to the 16-day shutdown government, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the model year 2014, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October, GM 42,660 sold silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose at the New York Stock Exchange by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The despair of an Obama elector
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican's blockage tactics
Block politics did not excuse Obamacare's website problems, drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election struggle were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible sad book right now.
It is a book from which I believed it would lift me up during the sad second year of my medical study and give me hope.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient signatures in the evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and for a reason could steal the breath.
The election was held as an Earthquake and a news speaker to show the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to the office in 2008, he had 82% of the vote.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad wake as if you're getting kicked out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad idea of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave up my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and diverse things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the party-political block-up strategy has made too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few.
But once I have defended Obama's government against my colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican Blockage Policy cannot explain why it is permitted to arrest foreign Heads of State or to kill innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is being punished for public misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without procedures and why public funding and spending limits will be dealt with during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to calm the media are the most "aggressive ... since the Nixon government".
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Apparently, the honourable Member is not a predictable course, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre mark the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And most of all, it bothers me.
I once again chose Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
In the middle of Romney was a confusing and unscrupulous alternative that he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and position.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, that free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard for so long.
However, with the decline in Obama's consents to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so severe.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to face a serious loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees that they should return to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has had a conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining plant, which was in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to erase questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could check up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are removed or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared 53 votes in favour of the recalculation to the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process of counting votes so that these could be replaced more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Whether the selection should take two months after the end of the vote
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which data entered into a computer is immediately selected and then the result reached at 6:30 p.m. at night?
Palmer also criticised the use of adhesives when marking the vote list.
Do you use it because you can radiate the results if you don't like them?
To vote today with pencils is incredible.
The election committee has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously".
At a public office it's about the service to the public.
"We do not seek any reward except history, that is, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global official investigation into currency manipulation is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperated with the authorities in the world's largest financial market in investigations, at which $5.3 billion per day changes in owners.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is currently to be authorised as European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were subjected to any misconduct.
As part of Usher's Instant Message Group, bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had stated that it was investigating an arbitrary manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks should have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also conducted internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are going through instant messages and e-mails for several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put the traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some banks have tried to lower the deal and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that “the market can already be affected by very low ticket prices”.
The message came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund office after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is over,” said Credit Suisse.
The building on the bed floor painted
A group of the citizens' initiative "Switzerland Wiese" decorated the building on the Bechtle ground floor at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the walkway, it is said in a press release.
The planned coverage of the falling house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site was threatened to collapse.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Prior to the BI's action, a transparent was posted with the message "We are for it".
However, the approximately 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative did not interfere with their action.
Her motto on the large poster was called "We are against the Bauruins".
So she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss plain - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passersby before the "Building" it was clear that some citizens believe that it will go much better with the implementation of the city's project, although not least have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they begin to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it is called on the side of the BI.
As was to be heard, the public statements of the mayor also appear.
At the municipal meeting in May, he said that he feared the use of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathroom and wellness complex in Switzerland.
Some appear to be just too frightened, others feel they are "pumped pressure attempt" in the population, it goes on to say in the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Ranknick sign for Schiris: Man no Schwalbenking
So satisfied is Ralf Rangnick with the current high-level form of the Bundesliga-Tablelenführer Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "Bullen" of the judges.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwalbenkings," he took the two offensives on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The most recent occasion for Ranknick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grodig last Sunday, when Senegalese became a supposed actor for suspension - which was not freely as the TV images showed.
"A great mistake," said Rangnick, the judge Harkam referred to as "completely overreached".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grodig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German Landsmann, saying, "I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharmüttzel with Hütter.
I didn't know why.
"Because I'm the one who got hurt," stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success of the race, however, Ranknick agreed to a Lobeshymne.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he noted.
There is not much to delay.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
Frame changes in winter transfer time will not be available.
There's no great reason to change anything.
"Aside from a player, there is a wish that he would leave the club," said Rangnick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges decided that the individual term of office of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it obliges US citizens to complete a health insurance or to pay a penalty by 2014 – was constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts was on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the Act and also upheld the view that the standard of the Health Act should be extended by the Federal States either to extend the access conditions for Medicaid or otherwise to delete all state Medicaid claims, unless constitutionally binding.
The appeal proceedings against the law were brought by 26 federal states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election struggle.
Norway: Norwegian place with giant mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low sunset rate, the Rjukan from autumn to spring, located in the Westfjord valley, usually falls in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors 45 meters high, a century-old dream was realized on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the opening ceremony on TV2.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley stood upright sun chairs; others set up sunglasses for safety.
So far, during the winter, the sun-fungarians had to travel on a rope track to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to link the beams with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has existed since 1913 in the place.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million kroner (about EUR 615,000) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine resort Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Can not get message: %s %s
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for the Sunday celebration are still on different mailboxes of the city and the parts of the city, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the learning on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP tells.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building is taught in Ernst-Ludwig-straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is also taught on Sundays, the answer to the FDP's question will not be answered.
The Social and Youth Policy Speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday learning is an important postal service at the time of appointment.
"This company is depressing in spite of the price increase for letters in January 2013 radically and irrevocably."
Thomas Bittner, president of the Group and the City Alliance of Liberals, supports his Group's colleagues: "What I'm upset about is the fact that the learning times are being changed or deleted here.
The post is far away from citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschlöß and Rosengarten need to be taught again Sunday," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also applicable to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens should also be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday exposure on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration was planning a conversation with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also exists in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurter Park Fees should rise sharply
Parks in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city's magistrate's council is discussing this morning a presentation by traffic agent Stefan Majer (Grüne).
Therefore, parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be raised, but the time range of parking watches and parking spaces will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the meeting of the city council was still to be decided.
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee considers this "no good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "a non-underestimable advantage for smaller traders".
The German Transport Club is the view that an increase after two decades is "adjusted and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions surprise host
With a narrow frame, the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Sculture Hall in Reutlingen had to come against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The Älblers stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it turned out that they, too old-fashioned, could not fully cope with the rapid actions of the friendly cities.
With the hard and placed strikes, the Gönninger became extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first bets clearly expressed the superiority of the city's friends in all interests.
In view of this impressive and playful performance, the third sentence was then won slightly lazily and unsatisfied at 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, with the Baiersbronn TV, which was able to perform clearly in Nagold, a significantly stronger opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They provided a hard fight two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mainly when balling errors and points gifts; also in the passes the precision was sometimes missing and in some critical plays the overcomer prevented the view of possible points.
In this powerfully balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team agreed through the great physical use and a happy engagement of both teams.
Care day at the small English cabin
Meanwhile, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cabin in Ibach in the wake of the Natura 2000 project of the upper Hotzenwald.
In view of the suggestions made by the population, it is appropriate to be cut free on this day in the area of the huts of view to the valley," said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Emperor, described this area as the glossy piece of the slope on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to place emphasis in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government’s Presidency of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the shield and wanted the action to succeed.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide-ranging area covers the goal of obtaining the highly-developed old Almendweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare rodents and grayheads, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections to maintain species.
Tribukait said she does not want to miss out on this place to break a chain for the planned biospheric area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only inextricably involved.
A biospheric area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project as well as the past maintenance days for the future.
After these different performances, the film director Christoph Wehle and Life-Project Manager Cornelius Bischoff shared the help in groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in the foreground, the forest climber was standing ready to pick up if necessary.
A group of assistants should take care of the release of watchbills and the maintenance of a dry rock line.
The objective was the free perspective.
Runnings: Köpfller still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Bavarian town of Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own city works, no second candidate has yet been registered.
As the only candidate for the succession of the no longer running mayor Norbert Brugger for age reasons, the 46-year-old banker and managing director Dieter Köpfler for Löffingen is still standing.
The time limit for application shall be Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Nortel patents filed
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, insisted on Thursday a wave of complaints about patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that he was oversaw when Nortel was insolvent.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for 4.5 billion dollars, complained of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is in the joint possession of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is detected in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents relate to technology that brings search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC present phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition for the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and recently offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being transferred to the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library to patents.
“Although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the patents for the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” the complainant wrote.
Rockstar calls for a high amount of damage from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt prepares first freely elected Presidents
Mohammed Mursi gives up office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt", when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus followed by Husni Mubarak, who was expelled 16 months earlier.
With its establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi has also been the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and Egypt to be the fifth head of state since the collapse of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid down the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, who had his seat at the Nile and found an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the celebration, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which had been taken into the visas since its establishment 84 years ago as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen were watching the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential prince of the Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the auto convoy could cross the usually-lived road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "resistance" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a speech of freedom, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to achieve the aims of the resurrection from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wooden tableroom in which he refused the office.
Later, Mursi went to Cairo University, where he was scheduled to give his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chaplain who played the national anthem that he heard in haft position.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of audiences in the largest auditorium of the University with speakers from "The Army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as the foundation of secular education, has developed into a high school of Islamic students in the 1970s.
Mursi laid down a symbolic oath on Friday at the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to regain the presidential power that the military council had taken over from the head of the government.
However, with the rejection of the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he is bent on the military's will, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursis speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" began.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25-party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the eventers of course on two days.
Worker crashed by leader: heavy injured
When a defective external sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg collapsed on Thursday and injured himself severely.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside facade of a guesthouse.
As he ascended to the leader on the roof, he rushed away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought with the rescue screwdriver "Christophorus 6" to the National Hospital Salzburg.
Violent in South Africa: twice lifelong imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and rape of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the offender was sentenced to two lives on Friday.
This was reported by the sender SABC.
The victim was later killed as a result of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had triggered dissatisfaction throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anne Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but was missing.
The sight of the young people was so overwhelming that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to be at night with boyies in a bar.
He was also about to beat them and rape them, but he fought to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially been arrested by several criminals, but two suspects were dismissed because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The public prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violations are almost daily in South Africa: There are about 64 000 ads every year due to sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of blacks in sexual violence on the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the black forest ham
Jumbo was looking for the "best ham of the world": For the TV show "Galileo", the Pro7-Star Bonddorf visited.
The speaker immediately explains at the beginning: the most important for the ham are the pigs, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can hams get in every supermarket, so it's a quality product?
Uli, the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo's way of working with the company "Adler" in Bonddorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel comes he into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can catch the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at fast limbis in Waldshut
"Here are huge amounts of work for me," the television makers, black forest hams, are stacking as a mass product.
16,000 keels per week speak for themselves.
Weight, Fat Part, Color: Uli explains what it gets at the quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered for six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," says Jumbo cynical.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But the look is worth it anyway.
The viewer sees that tearing down the cages is still manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditional without bones in the regal.
The secret of the ham is the mixture of spices with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "U-boot".
The trick: Danes here provide smoke for the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test food.
"It's really delicious," says the fact of the TV star.
This will enable all participants to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now proceeds from a adjusted annual profit before taxes between $325 and 340 million, compared with 305 to 315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are in a good way towards record-year income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure sector has recovered in the second half of the year, which accounts for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the United Kingdom, while here the business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third year thereafter.
The shares of the Flight Centre went up by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are kept to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, Romantic lyric and contemporary British novels since 1914.
The test also includes "unforeseeable texts" in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students have to carry out a separate GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curriculum for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core sectors will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Offqual, the supervisory authority for examinations, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new use system and less training.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would "be more challenging, ambitious and stringent".
Studies show that less time is spent in English schools for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hourly schedule, from coalition circles it means that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in rankings – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
The teaching plan focuses more on "problems from the right life", including financial issues.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes present the circuit performance show this weekend in the bourgeois house.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
Once again, the local community W514 is hosting this large exhibition.
Farmers of the Soest district show their best animals here as well as young Viking hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges conducted the evaluation of numerous rabbits and were able to score excellent animals.
The visitors of the show are best informed as the assessment of all animals is placed on the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open for all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., with the victory.
Guests are also invited to a local-priced Tombola and to a deliciously-occupied cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conference Forum
At the next Ecumenical Conference Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is about the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Discussions on today's dealings with the last things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conference Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Communities Salem, the Salem Palace and the Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum of the question, as people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had been too aware of it in the past centuries and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "which still characterize our ideas", the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of fulfillment is more marked by a certain difficulty or even confusion of speech.
"The greater hope has been driven Christians and Christians through religious criticism," says the rapporteur.
She has "supplyed us with so many questions that it seems to us that the call marks have come down".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the cause of death".
The question about that desire is linked to this, "which dreams that everything will be good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She promoted to Dr. Theol. in 1997 as well as in Freiburg.
The qualification for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Wilhelms, West Fälische.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been in charge of systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of Kassel University.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their faith in the firmation
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the soul care unit At Kleine Heuberg have been established.
In the morning, the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firmament, the young men said yes to their baptism and embraced the power of the Holy Spirit.
The entrepreneurs had prepared themselves in the past months, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the congregation on the big holiday.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of the Christian community and shared the youth in submathal.
Illmensee: Second Mountain Bike Race Exciting Participants
In wonderful weather, 214 bikers came to Illmensee to take the round course across the hills around the sea.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the participating sports association Illmensee.
The participants included, in particular, over 15 kilometres and 300 metres high, also numerous bikers who wanted to play their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two German top-class junior riders were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good positions at the German Championships.
These two could be expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time to the goal and defended his title as a total winner of the short distance.
In place two were able to place Pascal Trubel again.
In the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team's dream, which made it quite up on the top of the winner's stairs.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen came in place two and three.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire bandwidth was represented by athletes.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years in the oldest beginners.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topazlets at the start.
Four drivers were able to retire from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professor from the Black-Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was already two world champions together with a teammate at 12 hours.
This year he became a European master in this special discipline.
By doing so, Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German master titles in the Duathlon, also called his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, it came to a Weiper hit final in the finish line in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the target line.
Just a second later, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as third of the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
In the second place, Areae Blerch from Binzwangen was safe from Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through sludge, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon’s capital.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then he developed an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma there that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We'd have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but it's not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonans could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen were suffering because he had grown up in Bwelle to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have conducted 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a nurse at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also established a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and travel with the cut medical equipment on the roof over uninhabited terrain to the villages that need help.
It doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive them as heroes: a feast, a song and a dance, and the best accommodation to offer the place.
In these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and cheer – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to celebrate.
The next morning, the team will begin with the examination of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," Bwelle said.
They come from an area of 60 kilometers around the village – and walk.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive hugs, scattered glasses or free birth certificate – a document that is needed for the school, but many poor families simply cannot provide.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local immersion.
The operations usually take place in a school, home or apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is eaten by the generator of the group and thus works Bwelle and his volunteers until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an intense thought, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They're wandering all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will then return to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted free operations in the last year 700 and knows that it makes a huge difference for the people it helps with its work.
One man explained that the free operation of a performance break that he had been given is now possible for him to work again.
"That changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, as Bwelle says; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and volunteering to work in Bwelles Group.
He's always either in the hospital or he's trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support bubbles, this is an opportunity to gather practical experiences that they would never get home.
"We can be in operations where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated health material.
But if they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle will take over the accommodation, transport and instruction.
"He is certainly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonese people do not know the limits.
For Bwelle, the almost permanent work is not a burden.
To help others to a happier life and to fulfill a promise that he has given to his Father gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut off on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hater in his metier, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
So they just add up great.
You almost think you can see the folds in the neck of the old man, of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago gets tired of his life lying on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who did not give up and finally, through his knowledge and his willpower, won the battle against fish.
Janson is on stage as a sole producer in many ways.
He manages to focus the public's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not a bit boring.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewer forgets that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights each active scene: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise, who sings with her songs and her glorious voice the feeling of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythms and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Getting to the Romans
At about 120 meters long, below Cologne, a canal is obtained from the Roman era.
Whoever visits Cologne won't pass through the dome.
About 157 meters the two towers in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two phillican church towers recognize that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne Underworld.
The meeting point for its guides is the service centre of Cologne tourism directly on the dom.
The tour starts completely unspectacular: "We started in the underground garage", says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city’s fathers wanted a self-righteous city, and therefore the rest of the old city walls only remained standing which was not too big.
Most of the users of the parking lot are therefore also passing through the Roman restroom today and just drop off their car.
But who looks more closely, in the D2 deck, discovers an archaeological site separated by metal casting rods.
There are about five meters of high ruins made of handicraft large stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before going back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the top parking lot take another look in a window, 15 meters deep.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is not noticed.
The next station of the tour is the Pretoria, and here the participants go back down to the depths.
Here we experience the office of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the Prefect of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippainensium", which means as much in good German as "the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippan, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the culture of the emperor".
And in the Prefecture it is the former palace of State, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the premises of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman drain canal, which is maintained here for about 120 metres.
"You can take a piece quietly along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schools mutilates the guests.
A surprise still has school.
After getting the key on the box, he leads the group to a depth of 16 meters.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was indispensable for ritual washings.
To this day, at the bottom end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water stops are possible through changing peaks of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the site for which the construction works will begin shortly.
Until completion, however, a few more years will pass.
Almost hacked bone: Re-construction of the Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rock environment will be rolled up after more than four years.
A trial for attempted executions, dangerous bodily injury and damage to two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (Oder) District Court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants kept silent.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and were then part of the Bandidos.
In June 2009, the public prosecutor proposed that three men, together with unknown complicators in Finowfurt, have entered and hit a car.
All the victims were severely injured, a man would almost have lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have been part of the competing group Hells Angels.
One should have been a high-ranking member of Berlin.
Pre-existing was apparently a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was a revolution and a demonstration of power.
In early 2012, the two accused had been acquitted in a first trial.
At that time, a judge said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody enemy.
The criminals had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice raised the judgment following a review of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Land Court for a re-negotiation.
One of the accused is currently guilty of another crime in the open suit.
In particular, it was about the reconstruction of the processes in the night.
As a witness, the investigating Commissioner was then loaded.
The center was telephone conversations between the accused and other persons who had heard from the police.
It is difficult for Rocker to stand before the court almost always on an honorable law for them - and not to say.
This is also true of the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
State Attorney Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) State Prosecutor said on request that new traces have been discovered since the last procedure.
Eleven further negotiating days are set aside for the process.
The casting company does not think
The night was long, the music sounded and the mood was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the books of the people on the front seat and back the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, you may be responsible for some cocktail or sect!
What's closer there than going to the next drive-in to get a little bit?
I admit, I'd like to be with you when it comes late at night or early morning at the fast food hall.
A couple of potatoes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers become noticeable.
For what must one miss that you regularly throw his fast food bags out of the car window?!
Above all, on weekends, discarded paper tools are located on street corners and on parking lots.
"Well?" I ask myself.
Are people too deaf to take the victims home with them, respectively, to the next garbage dump?
Well, it's not just that the paper is changing the landscape.
Toys have already covered transport facilities such as guideboards and caused accidents.
But she probably didn't even know what this word meant.
If you are more often on the road in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look after spent nights: climbers, bottles and other garbage storms.
There would be a few more or less but nothing - in contrast to the road where no one wants to eat the rest of other rooms.
I already see the day when the cities and municipalities will have to bleed the weeds - and the fast food chains will have to demand for their aunts.
Obama retired in health policy
After intense criticism, President Obama made a frequent withdrawal yesterday with his clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of notice, the Republicans have rejected the President in the last days, he has deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promises.
"The majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the announcements, Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to look after a new insurance market.
Most citizens could receive better comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They're coming up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the population, which themselves had completed insurance, had to be covered by another tariff since their contract did not meet the new standards in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly that they have earned better," Sebelius said in a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the start of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement made by a Mr Sebelius to a councillor sitting behind her at the tight hearing in the representative's house was taken up after a dispute with the Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri, which was to determine whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refuse a state-funded insurance to close a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm an attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday against the American broadcaster CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air force in Syria a day earlier.
The objective was "Rakes and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared they were destined for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab envoy Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Wednesday night on Thursday, and made Israel responsible for this.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa defence rockets were visible and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertainly the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters also cites an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesperson of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We are not commenting on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-air rockets to Hisbollah earlier, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean exceeding a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unparalleled statement that the US espionage has been "too far-reaching"
John Kerry pointed out an unexpected change in the US's dissatisfaction with its monitoring programmes, saying that in certain cases the espionage was "too far off".
The Foreign Minister also added that he and Barack Obama bore the responsibility for turning on "Autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA's spying activities.
Through the information provided, the U.S. government has entered into a diplomatic storm of equipment on the part of its allies.
Kerry said in a speech delivered by video connection at the Open Government Conference in London: “The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned from some things that are almost by autopilot simply because there was the ability to go back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on September 11.
He then joined the U.S. government as the first high-ranking member that the U.S. espionage had exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone far too far."
The President has decided to create clarity, and he is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring procedures saved many lives.
He added: "We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to jump into the air themselves."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is about killing people, jumping into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and killing people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as stated by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first Democrat in the Senate and is chaired by the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of its concern over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, recorded by the NSA millions of phone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US allies, although the Chief of Secret Service explained this week that the reports were irrelevant and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents released by Snowden, which the NSA has monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The leader of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended spying with allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said his authority prepared for the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members shall be published in the following days.
He said the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and better protect Europe's rights, they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on his weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to discuss the role of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US monitoring activities.
The use of Nicolai Müller in the Federal Outward Game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg threatens to prevent a severe injury to the jump.
Mainz is concerned about a use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he was able to do this on an individual basis.
"We will decide for a short time about his use," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best torso with six hits.
Because the mains have already to renounce the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australia launches an appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15th of having made a false statement after she had told the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning of Sunday, June 10th, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had probably reached her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The P.D. in Phuket interviewed Bamford for two days until she was able to invent the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison with a low level of security on the edge of Phukets, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby League who has turned to the foreign ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are naturally worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 railways on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was to read that in the meantime she was vacationing in the resort Krabi in South Thailand.
On the side of the court hearing, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could have worked in Phuket to improve its tourist image after the recent assassination of Traveler Michelle Smith.
