Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might be "marionets"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are confined because they have been suggested to change their title, respectively called MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting within the Parliament of the Galais Country.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political stage are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside the country of Wales: "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Gali Party of the National Assembly of Gali Party said that the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group had an "open" attitude towards the change of name, but that it also observed that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Galais in the same way as the letter "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce a change of name, said: "The final decision on how to appoint members of the Assembly will certainly depend on those members."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales provided the Assembly with the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which suggested that many of them wish to use the "Plament of Wales".
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus could lead Elin Jones, the chairman of the Steering Committee, who is expected to send the draft law on changes over the course of a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way in which the meeting is to function, including rules on the disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word regarding their title when the law is being debated.
Macedonians vote for the referendum on the change of country name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on the change of their country's name to "North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute for decades with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim about its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a fierce opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take this vote into consideration.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is just a compromise that will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
The church bells of the Bishop St. Martin stopped fighting because of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
" Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you had found a bar and a church on each corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no more bars and churches."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People otherwise socialize today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually hang themselves."
And with regard to churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than expected by the leaders and that "earlier or later the disunity will be the same".
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not support the remains of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will speed up closing churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches".
Both churches were built by white-coloured congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, after a decade.
The original Methodist Congregation, composed of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African - American people, carrying out their religious activities close by, took over the building.
St. Martin Church was taken over by an African-American congregation, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted traders on 125th Street, a main street for the purchases of Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 had a great impact on the building, but the proud Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it and included the caravan in it.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, called the carriage "the bells of poor people".
The expert who put the carilon in operation in July described it as "a cultural chamber" and "a historical instrument without replacement".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, further stated that he was the first carilon in the world operated by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who passed to a larger carilon, to the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced by St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, including architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by episcopal diocese.
Sacristia, the parish government entity, formed from the diocese, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the diocese, even though it was not involved in the engagement of the architects and contractors sent by diocese.
Some of the envyers complained about the lack of transparency that proved the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old child trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the position of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he swims about half an hour, along with his friends, on Saturday morning, when he heard a boy crying for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get out of the water.
Hammel said that initially, he thought the boy was glad he caught a lobster, but then he realized that the scream "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole key was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called out to all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
There is no known species of shark responsible for the attack.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that is a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered from trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons .
Giles mentioned above that there are more than 135 species of sharks in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen his position on the market for beauty and fashion products in Britain
Sainsbury preia Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, making available regional beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of the position in the UK’s beauty products market, worth 2.8 billion pounds of sterling, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion product sales are not in measure, the largest beauty products regions will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores next year, if they prove to be successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes from the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for television, microwave and household products.
The representatives of retailer Sainsbury said that the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunchs its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are destined for vegan people, an increasingly popular demand among young buyers.
In addition, the French retailer's products The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sansbury chain stores for testing, the first being the open last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of retailer Sainsbury, said that outlets will increasingly appear as universal stores, because supermarket chains are trying to fight the battle with large retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury included both Argos outlet products in hundreds of stores as well as Habitats, since it bought both chains two years ago, which means it recorded increases in food sales and increased profit.
Previous attempt by the supermarket to reprobate the pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations stopped after a divergence on how to share the revenues of Boots stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business including 281 stores, Celesio, which owned Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, retail director Sainsbury, said: “I have transformed the appearance of our beautiful regions to improve the environment for our customers.
I have also invested in specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and suitable locations transform us into an extraordinary location to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a contract of 11 million pounds sterling
The TV protagonist "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is angry after the TV show Holly Willoughby retired from a contract worth 11 million pounds with his life-style company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to engage in their project on the True brand, including accessories and household objects.
The couple’s company was compared to Goop’s brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Presenter of this “This Morning”, 37-year-old, announced on Instagram that he would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" show, retreating at the last moment of their business offering life-style services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was angry when one of the most loved ones on television admitted Tuesday, during a meeting held at his business capital in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds of sterling, did not allow her to dedicate their brands, True, including accessories and household objects.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's wealth, an estimated 11 million pounds sterling.
After Willoughby, 37 years old, announced Instagram that he would give up the contract for True, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
One source states: “Truly was one of Holly’s priorities.
She had to be her future in the long run for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened on Tuesday was less until the launch.
There is a full warehouse with products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this “This Morning” issue, which is one of the best sold in Britain, could lead to the company's millions of damage, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible additional delay in the launch.
It may also represent the end of a long - standing friend.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby laid the foundations of the True brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" show.
A nearby source of Jones said last night: "We don't want to comment on his business."
I was very hard, and then "I fell in love"
He made fun of the criticisms he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider "noble of a president" and that he had such a positive attitude with regard to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice of "the news representative".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
Better than three months from the June Singapore summit, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders all over the world on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not notice a "response" from the United States regarding previous steps in North Korea's disarmament.
On the other hand, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"All goes well with North Korea," he said.
"We had to go to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: stopping rocket tests, supporting hostage release and returning US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I behave like this, instead of 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this invincible arena, it would be around 200 people," Trump said, showing the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and a earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing hundreds of people to die
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, a national disaster was not declared a necessary condition for launching aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the Foundation "Save Children" is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the place.
Sutopo, the spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies can contribute to the aid efforts.
In view of Indonesia's constant earthquakes, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be inadequately prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often encountered on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palau, although a warning was issued in this sense, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the trip between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo proposed that improving the infrastructure should be the central point of his electoral campaign and that he spend money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will take part in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from the Indonesian sectors because members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes, as gangs of Christians and Muslims have been on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the lifeline and equals the score in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a battle in the Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday, at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it is about 30 meters from the side of the opposing team, and his team was led by Chelsea with 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached the top of the one, heading up to the corner from the top right of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed through Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped to her and fell into the gate.
"I should just try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to advance as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, I just took the ball further."
Chelsea took a 1-0 break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The blue team attack sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic and then returned to the center of the field and ran to half of the Liverpool team's field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the ground.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered.
Hazard crossed the defense and sent the ball in place, managed to hit it with his left foot and pass by player Alsson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team in the League of Champions group on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team at UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, in the morning of Sunday.
Several people were caught under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and that triggered waves up to 6 meters, said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 people, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of killing a woman by drowning
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman, aged 44, was found at 7:55 in the morning, with stab wounds at Grayson Mews, on John Street, and was arrested a man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who heard or saw anything about this issue to come to the statement section.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I appeal to all the people who are near John Street in Birkenhead who have heard or seen anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the room to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman from Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who think I know a woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police have said they're trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told that it would take a few hours until they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
In front of the place, there was a woman in tears.
Repeatedly "it's so terrible!".

Several police officers were standing in the perimeter monitoring the apartment block.
Any person who has information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the number 0800 555 111 and mention the case 247 of 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by changes in the "rewriting of history"
The removal of this would be a poetic justice for destroying the Taliban-style cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its subsequent fanatic Puritans.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues as a figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
The English Civil Wars iconoclass was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his grandfather Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the story of a figure that many think deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
However, the conflict since the middle of the 17th century has certainly determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer from China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only by the name of the family "Yuan", was found dead after he was segregated an artery and was covered with blood, near a pig farm located in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editor of the Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Looks like he came with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
He said there's a pig in the cot with large blood sizes in his mouth.
The doctors confirmed that a pig of approximately 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and sweat," said the cousin, whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police narrowed evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and the authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although I'm rare, cases of pigs that attacked people have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man in Galais State was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and take the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the blood taste can trigger such reactions."
"It's just playing.
They like to move, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them proper respect," he said.
The Red Hurricane, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the south-west of the United States
As recommended, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves to the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States in the following days.
Rosa records wind conditions at 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located approximately 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it began to form a depressing zone across the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Bay of California peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed zone will generate abundant rains in the southwest in the following days.
Local precipitation between 3 and 10 cm will result in dangerous rapid floods, waste streams and possibly desert landslides.
The intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm in the south-west part, especially most of Arizona, is expected.
It is possible to have rapid flooding due to rapid deterioration due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert below, given the threat represented by the tropical rain.
The heavy rain could cause the canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into reefs and dust.
The depressing zone that is approaching will bring torrential rains to areas on the southern coast of California.
There are possible precipitations of nearly 2 cm, which could result in lower flows of wastes and alunge roads.
They will be the first precipitation in the region in the wet season.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and on the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more months evening and Tuesday.
The intense precipitation will spread in so-called "four corners" on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature changes in the United States, as the Arctic region will become colder, but tropicals remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in short distances temperature.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the U.S. central zone level.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the extended heat of the summer will try to form and expand again.
It is anticipated that a large part of the central and eastern United States will face a warm beginning of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the South to certain parts of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high rates of temperatures above average for the US east until the first half of October.
About 20 million people have followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that is supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, political confrontation continued, TV posts interrupting the normal Friday program for a last-hour news: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Judicial Commission that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had stolen it while he was in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to undress it at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense witness, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have been followed by Friday's hearing.
The company counted average vision on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble conjuring up people who see from the office.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose guest opinion strongly supported Kavanaugh's name, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was tracked by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
The interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the Office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS chambers last Friday morning while the protesters shouted at him and he tried to get into an elevator at a session of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were arguing about it, and everything was broadcast directly to CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
He was told, "You are powerful, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast directly within the Judicial Committee to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh to vote by the Senate.
But Flake said he would do this only if the FBI agreed to analyse the charges against the nominees next week, something required by minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced of the talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's choice was an important one, making it clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses criticism of "political games" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermine national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Britain, participated in the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview near his accompanying photo on the first page of the paper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect their reciprocal tariffs was "a total ridiculous".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dieteon Simpson, suspected to have shot the LSU player dead
Police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player at the age of 20.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with grade 2 murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published the filming of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the siege.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, affiliated with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he admitted that he shot Wayde dead.
His claim was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Legal Medicine Bureau Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, saying death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The Department deserves the Louisiana police force, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of that area, for the aid provided for the investigation, which led to the arrest.
Athletic Director LSU Joe Aleva thanked the police for "deserving and seeking justice".
Yeahs was 20 years old.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, it marked, on average, 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoverys.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "damaged" and "astounded" by Wayde's death.
"This thing worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a column of ashes over the city of Mexico City
The censorship from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after the start of their activities in the crater and were recorded 183 gas and ashes emissions over 24 hours.
The centre monitors several surges and vibrations.
The images of socialization networks presented layers of ash on car parbrisles in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake hit the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Consolidation between the police and Catalan separatists before the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors pro-independence broke out with January, at the first anniversary of the vote for the secession of Catalonia, gathering thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists held away from jandarmi bombed those with eggs and powdered wax, creating clouds dark with dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The tension was intensified later, the police using their batons to control the situation.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups have been firing "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while Union protestors have been shouting "Life Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose, in a overwhelming majority, to become independent, although voting was low, and those against the secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
I looked at my parents crying for joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite the achievement of a vital but narrow victory in the December regional elections last year, the pro-independent Catalan parties have tried to maintain the advantage this year, many of the most famous leaders being either in exile or in detention, awaiting the trial for the role they played in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in police support, said the politicians on both sides had fueled the conflict.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the repression I have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: More men were arrested after they got into a house with the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a Londonderry house several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 19:30, in Ballyngard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said they were damaged at the level of the gates and even the building.
It seems that at a given time, a device was used against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unrecorded, Steven Gerrard reaching the second defeat in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernian in the second time.
Gerrard's team is missing a victory in the Premier League this season and is facing the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues unbeatable in division up to six matches, Holt's main coach still feels the taste of defeat, as he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the crotch visitors
Holt's team should've gone ahead a long time before writing down, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to cross and tried to sneak in on the port space, then Alan Lithgow managed to sneak in long after he entered the loop to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The bosses were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for visitors at free hits.
And this was the way the crucial void came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed to open up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to take care of Menga, who looked and marked out of the center.
At that stage, Rangers dominated the property, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and porter Liam Kelly was no longer in big trouble in the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second replay, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman didn't make it against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Littgow gave a big shot from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal steps continued to come in which the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two requests for penalty - after Halkett hit Glenn Middleton and after a hen - were not accepted.
"Femenal game" by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, with no exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward path.
Their game style and team have not changed since they returned to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he trained his team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worall in trouble throughout the party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they've had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they haven't reached the same standards.
The empty steps were unsuccessful, they only managed to catch the port of free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the class.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
It was all pink Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
The police have called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but quite a number of supporters have gathered close to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, the majority of the Kurds, heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it with open arms in the country.
The protests in the opposition reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and a self-crate of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies following a collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics appeared at the scene of the accident, but the man died in front of the place.
The accident took place only a few months after another biker died after an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver ran from the front of the place, which is about a mile from the place where the accident happened on Saturday.
The metropolitan police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the bus route is deviated, and motorcyclists are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured due to a blackout
Six prison officers were injured as a result of a detention in a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
Sunday, a stay at HMP Long Martin from Worcestershire was launched at about 9:30, which is underway.
Specialized officers have been brought to take care of the stay, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated in front of the site for minor injuries.
A spokesperson for the prison said: “The assistance of the prison personnel was requested to deal with an incident in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules on those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after thank you."
In the HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, officers dealing with disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the Rosa hurricane (the drought zones can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Red Hurricane will be used in the south-west desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flooding warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western zone of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is anticipated that Rosa will have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second day of the month will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Weather Service announced in a Twitter message that "only ten tropical cyclists have maintained a tropical storm or depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an action hurricane about 60 km away from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Urbane predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including in the centre of Stáncosi and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in certain areas, torrential rain will be beneficial because the southwest is facing drought problems.
According to the United States Sect Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona faces at least a severe drought, respectively the second largest category", information found on weather.com.
First, the Red Hurricane will lead to landslides in the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still has the power of hurricane in the morning of Sunday, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, with 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce landfills in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of the moon.
Mexico's torrential rains could be significant, presenting a risk of high floods.
"There are expected torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to the northwest of Sonore, and can also reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before arriving at the border with Arizona in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in the south of Utah on the night of Tuesday.
"The dangerous principle represented by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain from Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Urbane.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods that endanger people's lives and bring waste streams into the desert, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
An attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-olds were arrested tonight in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Officers have requested the help of citizens who might have material on their mobile phone, respectively, to appear at the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the "unhappiness and pride" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unmistakable and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also stated that Kavanaugh faced the "unhappiness and pride" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress, strongly denying Christine Blasey Ford's statements about having sex with her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her statement.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best minds in this generation's legal field," he told the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh as I spoke about the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but somehow, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I express my full positive opinion of the candidates whom I consider to be immense."
Trump argued that the Democrats are in a mission to "resist and obstruct".
It is anticipated that the first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination will take place no later than Friday, a GOP leader for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesia's earthquake, the number increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and a tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people flocked to a beach festival on Friday in Palu, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at amurg, people being taken by water and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, becoming such victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency, said at a Jakarta press conference.
"The tsunami brought with its own cars, pockets, houses, hitting everything on the dry ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled extensively at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the country.
He added that some people were forced to climb into trees to escape the tsunamis and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency present several buildings and destroyed warehouses, scattered and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the replicas continued to stir up the town on the coast.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that the energy generated by the heavy Friday earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the Atomic Bomb at Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geographical structure of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow golf course, probably intensified the expansion of the tsunami, added this representative.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and casualties could be larger along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information" in Dongala, Nugroho said.
There I live more than 300,000 people," Crucea Roşie said, adding that her staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized because it did not report that a tsunami was going to hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In the posts on socialization networks, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting brake warning that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
In a few minutes, a water wall is hit by the ground, taking this building and the machines.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a major interruption of electricity, which has blocked communications in Palau, making it difficult to coordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The Army began to send freight planes to Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the Word Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in improvised shelters in the court of the office, they passed on the devastating scene, Doseba said.
She added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed. ”
The situation is very serious.
Even if the aid groups began to take action in the event of a disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financial resources, supplies of materials and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if a national disaster area is declared.
This hasn't happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster', we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has yet been announced.
After the second night of the earthquake and the Friday tsunami in Palau, friends and families of the missing hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
Sunday, the rescue personnel released a woman under the ruins of two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the national parachute team, trained for the Asia Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing parachute pilots.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in paragliding activity, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, within hours of spreading news about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of paraptane sports practitioners, he sent desperate messages to the Palu competitors who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in his right of message there was only one gray biffee, and not two blue biffee.
"I think that means the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport banker on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee Brink who feeds a banker in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver emptyed a ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "run behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that had to be transported.
According to the report, the witnesses observed several suspects who fled the scene, but the police did not mention the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police on the phone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
It made Saturday an announcement about the change on Twitter: "the official known as Kanye West".
The West, at the age of 41, is called "Ye" for a while and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show instead of the Ariana Grande song, which cancelled "for emotional reasons", the producer mentioned the show.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of the current name of the scene, West said earlier that this word has also a religious significance for it.
"I think "ye" is the most frequently met word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, during the discussion about the title of the album with the Big Boy radio host.
"Because I am you, I am we, it is about us.
It all started with "Kanye", which means the only one, and arrived at "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, bad, nuclear and all.
The album is more a reflection of what we are as people."
He's one of the most rappers who have chosen to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with cream, others without, as well as with large letters.
Mexico's president promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, while nearing the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody rebate against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
The troops fired a peaceful demonstration from the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the left movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding for the IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come as soon as several members of the US government have made announcements about IA, even if there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the US.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be first in terms of innovation IA by 2030.
"Dublining the IA Research Budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are much more behind the US and that we are looking for the next IA discovery," Lee said.
Duplicateting the funds could double the chances of the next major implementation in the field of IA being made in the US, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers IA: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at the Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat American player Othello, being the best in the field at that time, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated the previous American governments' technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"China does not put beer in the hands of academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired remarkable graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US intensify its IA efforts.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctors in the IA," he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other governmental organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Common Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the US Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
NSF is also currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes to US legislation aimed at establishing a Commission on National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in the referendum if they want to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wish the country's name to be changed to "North Macedonia," a change that would resolve an old dispute for a decade with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts as to the presence of the vote, and it was possible not to reach the minimum limit of 50% necessary for validating the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO accession, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the expulsion of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the country's future, for young Macedonians to live free under the shadow of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79, told Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a number of Members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds quorum is needed in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the persons with voting rights were put to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, at the age of 62, a voter in Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the change of Macedonia's name, which will allow them to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, at the age of 54, prepared a scene of small dimensions and took a seat in front of the courts raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them face-to-face, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not willing with the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a greater 20% unemployment rate.
"I think that the majority will be in favour of the change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he gave his vote.
He said that a result of the change of name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of the eligible citizens will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another survey, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Among them, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be at 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow at the level of pro-vestic government policy since the government took over last May.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to go through the entire Brighton team and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to run the Brigton team and win the Manchester City 2-0 team on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to walk in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack took a step in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton before reaching the free side of the land.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass through an advocate, and then he exceeded several warning players at the edge of Brighton's team.
After that, he took a left hand, the balloon coming to Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, and managed to avoid the porter from Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a needle to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces a few problems on his feet," told reporters Pep Guardiola, Manchester City team manager.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote a blank at the time."
But Sterling is the one who got them the first advantage for Azuri in the Premier League game.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a deep passage on the Brighton team territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a hand on the left flank.
Sane shook the balloon several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it to the gate.
The Azuri attack hit the balloon to the plaza right before heading out of the field.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 in the group phase, Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make a mess of the game against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the play-off competition, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday's match against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there's still some involvement in the play-off for Rockies, which has an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers game in the NL West.
Rockies got at least an unpredictable place, with a victory of 5-2 against the national team on Friday evening, but still trying to keep his first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, from Denver, along with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point that I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the Sunday match, but according to the sources, is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening of the 34th match, had a heating session on Thursday and will drop under normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington middle house has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ratings in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation regarding a decision by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republic's presence in the interim elections.
"All our effort is at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great ones, not candidates, but in fact candidates, which is why I am trying in vain to support good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this terrible, radical group of democrats, see what is happening right now.
And they're determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see their evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to scratch to get power and control, that's what they want, have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that the Democrats are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he said earlier, describing the Democrats as "furnished and evil, ugly and lying".
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and is a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, which has been severely depleted by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Excuse me?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me that Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censorship with regard to me.
Finally, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because it was very strong in anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the censorship motion was a criticism of my address that I did not agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, about which Jeremy did not share his views with previous leaders.
Communication to the Friday session of the Labour Party Nottingham East said that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evenings were so.
Unfortunately, today many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, softer" political environment has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the party's management.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision about politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things I had not agreed with before, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the desocialization networks that require my removal from the party, denouncing the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who faces this.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than my colleagues because the comments about my person tend to be political.
I am impressed by professionalism and the determination that I give to my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every censorship or change of the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly less flexible in this regard.
Many people have recommended that I put my head down for the last two years, not being so vocal, and everything will be "good" like that.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the neglect that thatcher's government has shown has led to my class collapse, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them the most, as a local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including in my last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the aspects that I disagree with regarding current leadership are unclear.
People who have supported Friday's motion can only say that, in the context where the country is heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider to be in your best interest.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Air football team reaches the top of the classics
Despite the fact that two late trials influenced in some way the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the extremely interactive match today at Tennent's Premiership.
He's now in the top of the class, being the only team without any defeat from the ten.
Finally, everything was summed up in their best defense, as well as in the fact that they took more chances, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to more tests during our matches so far and we continue to be innocent, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The merit is given to the Air team, they have taken more chances than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Air team, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who could join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unprocessed test.
The climate got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to sign up, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr on break.
But Melrose started second very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes because of Ruarid Knott's serious injury, which had been taken out of the field and since the start of the game, Ayr was released through the trial of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a full pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Straan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he liked the Air Force's ballless climate, MacPherson managed to march, offering him the advantage of the Air Team.
The climate transformed the experiment, as it did again almost from the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe had run a box kick movement and sent the extreme Gregor Henry into the depths for the fifth attempt of the host team.
The view of the sitcom "Still Game" seems prepared for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, who saw the Still Game site, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after he learned that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis's role in BBC's favorite show, writing his script and playing with his long-standing partner, comedy actor Greg Hemfill.
The two announced that the next series, the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register information, this is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the "industry in the development of restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the island of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a shipyard full of macarals in La Paz.
Public buildings build the blue flag, like the ocean.
The ship bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our law.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has not come out of the sea, the memory of a coast lost in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of resources of the 19th century is still alive – like the desire to go back to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary advantage, a spirit of unity and Senate and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign offshore exit, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial fight for the coming year – also has many gains due to the decision of the months.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that there would be too little change if it happened.
The United Nations organisation in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after final pleas have been heard indicates that this case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has Bolivia not been successful, but it's possible for the last four years to have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea was distorted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's bubbling rhetoric weakened any Chilean remnant's goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to deal with discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually rapid.
On Monday, it will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must pass through the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it couldn't trust Washington.
Ri talked about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made during a Singapore summit, with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months of meeting North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it is a "real vision" that the continued sanctions and the United States' objection to the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war would ever cause the territory of the north to give up.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement without the Phenian first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are a lot of skeptics that I don't think the Phenian has serious intentions to give up on the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends with regard to the hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for layers to extend your collection or protect you completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
The fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
In no practical way did they conquer the Instagram platform this summer, and fashionmakers sent the creations that steal their eyes on the podium.
The piece of creation resistance, made by Valentino, was an extravagance, bej-colored hat, with a wide boor, like a pen, where the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included nailed beads, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre places, on time for Halloween.
Many of the colored towns had cut lips and brought more of the accessories chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and no high fashion sewing.
One of the creatures seemed to be an earthenware, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a dress style, with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
Stylists advocate a return of huge dolls in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized roofs return after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the pajamas hat with a large boor, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the completely practical hat that has appeared on all socialization networks has caused the appearance of another oversized creature on the podium, each of the beach people, with a size as large as the bathing suit that wears it.
Portocalie bag from the reef, with stripe brakes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of the Spring-Far 2019 "La Riviera" collection of Jacquemus's Fashion Week from Paris
The fashion designer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized decks and beach people in luxury stores next summer, because the fashion designer had such a powerful impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for examinations, which is supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are trying to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak his own language, words will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classrooms, with the highest rates of promotion in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS students showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish also obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as matter, are held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other areas.
A survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers for the fight against job vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of linguistic skills.
Thus, increasingly, linguistic skills become imperative for young people to prepare for their future career.
With more opportunities for jobs requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, with such ability throughout their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouTube on over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by one percent of two digits, 15%.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially in developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be several language choices in independent schools, with educational frameworks that are specialized in this field.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the necessary skills to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It must be done well (Treasure done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will begin at Lakers on Sunday, in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James begin with Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced James will play in opening Sunday's press release against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But how many minutes will the game remain to be established.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers program of six press games.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need games in the press to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia election meeting time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five meetings scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the election is favourable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for the candidate selected by him for the free place from the Supreme Court is suspended temporarily, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., East Coast time, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can track Trump's election meeting from West Virginia through the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, a candidate at the Supreme Court, hearing that has become tense due to allegations of improper sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected vote of confirmation is suspended for a week so the FBI can investigate the allegations.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who are faced with tough elections in November, to win some land.
Thus, the members of President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five meetings next week is "to energize volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control over Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign said to Reuters, who did not want to be appointed.
Programmed to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's meeting could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won the elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who's being conducted in the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to push him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team gives evidence of determination and continues to fight to maintain the chance for simple tests that start on Sunday
After three well-dominated sessions, it is possible that Saturday throughsome tests might have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-changing pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players even believe in it, so much more in competitions like this.
So where is their motive now?
"We were guided by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we are based on this decline for a little reason," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with an advance of four points, when there are still twelve points in the game.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game begins to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have won every three of the four points.
Spieth sent the mines to the green zone with a lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those festive gouts became increasingly noisy as the round went ahead, especially when he wrote a crucial point through which he ran the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been driven with two points after the first two holes.
The beating that won the 15th match was celebrated with a similar wallet, a wallet that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your own game," Spieth says.
That's how many of these players are left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange couple, however adorable, of Europe won four out of four matches and it seems I can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't need any additional hit on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid both for Saturday morning and for Friday afternoon, even for the new Friday morning points.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would eventually lead to a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun shines over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, at different holes.
Discussions on the glory of Europeans remain premature, at the moment.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly from Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of fourballs, when he made couples with Alex Noren.
An additional two-fold shot at the first nine holes had sunk Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and worthy of being followed because of the interactions between pairs, data and nude tips and the way in which a strategy can be changed on-the-spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this forum session has shown and that the US team has reason to continue fighting, which some, in particular those in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after it has finished the fourballs and Saturday fairs with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led offensively with two victories in front of an exciting Tiger Woods, which has increased their score so far to the Le Golf National at four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to recover the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes at the fourballs trial in the morning and won the 3-1 series.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of all 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European news to win four points in turn, and together with Molinari, a pair called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pairs to win four of the four opening matches in the entire history of the Ryder Cup.
After they smashed Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs' test, they superbly supported themselves to defeat the brave Woods and the American news Bryson Dechambe with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two Saturday matches, had occasional genius clips, but so far he lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were consecutive battles.
Justin Rose, who retired during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to the foursome test and faced Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, one and three positions in the world.
Europe did not, however, have a course without obstacles on this pleasant and calm day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple winner of major tournaments, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, then came back later and fought Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in simple trials, although, because they are the current owners of the trophy, Furyk’s players only need an equal result.
However, after they were in place for the second two days in a row, a Sunday strike seems unlikely.
North Korea declares that there is no "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that extending sanctions will deepen confidence in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that in North Korea there were "significant measures to prove good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and testing rockets, dismantling the nuclear test site and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any proper response from the US," he said.
"If we cannot trust the US, we will not trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's family's objections about Washington's opposition to a "dissolved" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as the Phenian did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at a summit between a US president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim undertook to make progress towards a "declaration of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States said the Phenian must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has failed to respond to requests for relief from international severe sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the option of "first denuclearisation" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, which is even objecting to "the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can humiliate us is an illusion that only people do not know us.
But the problem is that long-term sanctions undermine our confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump referred to by the US leader in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearisation had been negotiated with South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, Ri's tone of speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US territory with rockets from North Korea after "the evil president" Trump called Kim a "man-racet" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for his courage to start the disarmament process, but stated that work was only beginning and that sanctions would remain valid until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say the Phenian should be compensated by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said today for the UN Security Council: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be effective and uninterrupted until we have complete, final and confirmed denouncing."
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block the funds for nuclear programmes and the ballistic missiles of the Phenian.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colours of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit had no good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea complained that he had made "bandster threats".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has committed to dismantle a missile launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new course from Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of "macho" that makes these to be subject to "all night" learning sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students of the most prestigious universities in the world often do not even master the basic concepts of how they should care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type of U.S.A.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
"At last, a girl came and said to me, "Why are you telling me this just now, in the last year?"
She told me she never talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help to improve academic and athletic performance as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour can involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section presents the image of a living room, and students can click on coffee dogs, pearls, sports pants and books to tell them what are the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know that we cannot change the students’ behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night there is still, says it, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have transformed sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sleep enough, of a good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes students feel constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler create the course, after participating in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where the competition is expensive.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for waking hours, and to know what are the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to win Gerrard's team
Rangers suffers from another case of displacement depression because Dolly Menga's beating sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 match at Livingston.
The team on Ibrox wanted to win the first victory in the 4-1 triumph against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to give Gerrard the second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts Rangers with eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga signed up seven minutes before the break and the uninspired players from the Rangers didn't seem to be able to balance in any moment.
Rangers fell this way on the sixth position in the classroom, while Livingston went up the third place, behind the Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers might also face other problems, because the Calum Spence shower arbitrator had to be treated for a head injury after an object was, apparently, thrown at the hair of the visiting team fans.
Gerard changed eight players from the lottery that won easily against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot drowned his opponents during the match.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the mines they had more efficiently.
He should have walked just two minutes after the game started, when Menga's first pass pushed Scott Pittman to the door protected by Allan McGregor, but the middle house missed a very good occasion.
A deep-seated hit by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent it to the bar.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that more hope than they have confidence in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have received a penalty when he was shocked by Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers managed only two hits on the front door, but Ibrox's former porter Liam Kelly was not disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although the 34-minute gap in Livingstone did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was worth it, even for the effort it made.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple blow.
Gerrard took a break, when he changed Ryan Kent with Coulibaly; this movement almost gave him the wheel right away, when the extreme focused Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the buttons to block him.
However, Livingston continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match she prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett who intercepted post-centre centers.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacob's beating, then Lithgow sent his head to the corner door.
Glenn Middleton, reserve at Rangers, asked for a penalty at the end of the match, when he hit Jacobs, but again Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: inventor of Geiger office
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Sunday: September 30, 1882, with 136 years ago (and CONTINUE count...), is the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
An essential device for science ever since, Count Geiger has become essential for pop culture, as has happened in the film "Clopotes in San Coronado" (1950), where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have played as cowboys with unlikely tendencies to science:
The man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these baskets, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, there are a lot of startups!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration in a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and then are re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, then injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have to deal with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to "learn" them to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West has maintained a support diather of Trump, while wearing a MAGA lock, after appearing at SNL.
It didn't come out too well
Kanye West was killed in the studio during Saturday Night Live's show after a dismal show where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intends to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist resigned in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I’m talking to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist”
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, where Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the West Diatribe film was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to get over West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems in the cults because of his sects.
"They tried to intimidate me into clumsies.
They told me, "Don't go wearing this hat."
I was attacked!
They told me I came down very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I'm down?" then he said, "I'm going to get Superman's cover, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted refugees from the public at least twice, and the members of the SNL team seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a member of this team told the publication: "A full silence has been reached in the studio."
West was invited as a last-hour replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose beloved rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of cracks when he played song I Love it dressed like a Perrier glass.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits of us: I am grateful that you have faced GLOATA."
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and this is wonderful".
"By choosing not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") about whom I think he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, announcing that from now on he is "a woman officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West runs after Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then into "the former artist known as Prince".
A charge of attempted murder for a stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is expected Monday before the Belfast Court.
The charges will be analysed by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the Queen of the Thrones, attacks toxic maleity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the series of violent medieval fantasies of the Thrones' Urzeala, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes boys think they have to be hard to respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said it seemed to him that "something was wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Thrones' Urzeal, Rose Leslie, who is only 31 years old, admitted that it is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about this now: where did I make a mistake with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and from the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear something wrong with young people happened."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any kind of series based on the Urzeal of Thrones after the series ended in the summer of next year, saying that he "ended with the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new production of True West Theatre by Sam Shepard, who presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is thalhar.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him because of the series of the Thrones is that he met Rose's wife.
"I met my wife when I made this series, so she assured me of my family's future and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the winning fantasy series of several Emmy awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those of the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many cases of transmission of diseases stem from inadequate measures of sexual protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its efforts to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of the Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday the charges that a member of his team posted personal information about three republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat in Los Angeles claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of the "right extreme".
"Minions, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
The information released included the senators' personal address and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The flow of information took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and presented information to a member of the Waters team, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The team member, whose identity, personal and security information was compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that he does not have the temperament needed to be a Congressman.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
It must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh, criticised by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"It's important, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate legal authorities and entities about these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be responsible in front of the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English hits again: parody without flag of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to search for the meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film series of action films which has as its main character Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this vengeful satire of how strange we are to become the new export opportunity of the nation?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with her eyelids and rubber face, was renewed to the second time the license to erase everything. Name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematographic audience in unspeaking English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the secret agent who, despite his claims of luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a knife from that guy who contributed with one single note on the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without the country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV ads, which left chaos behind.
This last JE's adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English got close to a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the wheels of the wheeler hit his coyote easily.
The gift that Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" films, such as those in the 007 series or impossible Mission, offer comic moments as an ingredient with confidence.
Death seems to address more children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's dazzling adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's stupid filmgaps when playing Bean's role.
As usual, the assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the British Supersecret Spy Web Network and has revealed the identities of the British agents under cover, to the dispersal of the service agent, a regrettable role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last hit for a prime minister and under siege, who already suffers a serious crisis due to a decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything he can with his like Theresei May, but the scenario does not give him a chance to shine.
Its intelligence advisors inform it that all active spies have been compromised, so it must activate an agent in the reserve.
This is Johnny English himself, now working as a teacher in a high school, which also teaches you how to be an undercover agent. Here are some nice gags, because English runs a school-style spy academy in the School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then met with his time partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit ironic.
Thus, these Batman and Robin of the creation of intruders in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, confronting the beautiful dead woman Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technology industry who claims he can solve the problems of the UK's IT: the late Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch in an odyssey of boreistic adventures: go out in waiters, set fire to a French fashion restaurant, create chaos when it runs on the board of Volta's luxury boat, then English launches anarchy in pure form when trying to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but whatever the nice and colorful film is, it seems to be a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
Like the other movies with Johnny English, I can't stop asking myself: can't the British cinema industry even give Rowan Atkinson a role in the measure of his talent?
Neglected labians plan to have British work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan that the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It appears that the party wants the company’s managers to benefit from the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving the employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
The sources say that the idea would be "appropriate" to the party's economic programme, which wants to strike a balance in favour of workers.
The four-day shift is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changing the economy.
A source of leadership from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A policy review announcement is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspirations for the rebalancing of the economy party in favour of the worker, as well as the general strategy of the industrial party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's 2017 campaign promises for general elections.
However, this aspirations are not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not included in the party calculation."
The cabinet Chancellor's lord of shadow, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labourers' conference last week to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it is determined to take back the power from the "no-face directors" and "no-face owners" from the utility companies.
The cancellation plans of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-supply regions could not recover their shares in full because the Labour Government could incur "debts" due to detected crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company management councils and create ownership funds by giving 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who will receive such annual dividends up to approximately 500 lire.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the "60 Minutes" issue if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him change his mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought to Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Republican senators might be convinced that they no longer support him because of the FBI's findings.
In a broadcast interview on Sunday, the correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them think about it.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, promptly, without mistake."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be buried in the rock.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so some explosive charges would be needed," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons named by her confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something's going to change."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual musical event to be attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: eradicating world poverty.
Until the seventh edition, the Festival of Global Citizens will attract tens of thousands of people on Central Park, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers hoping to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to purchase a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what was the success of the Festival of Global Citizens when I am only 12 years old to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case so-called "clictivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters have been registered, which have promoted different goals.
The organisation says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least 10 billion dollars were already spent or abroad.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with the headquarters in Britain of investors and intermediaries who have "helped children grow up to their full potential", which has promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving over 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the majority during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it will finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequent questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and make a mistake.
But like the great movements for civil rights or anti-apartheid that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will sing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the naval forces for a "block" that exacerbates Russia's energy exports, says the Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason I'm in the Middle East is that I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in the south of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and methods of managing the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a barrier, so that energy does not come into the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants to an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said about Russia, saying that it "knows only one trick" because of the dependent fossil fuel economy.
The declarations come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline "inadequate" project, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline, at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said that the fierce US opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think that we look at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which we put pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, the Minister of Energy in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary in Moscow, in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of Industries in Germany (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third state is involved in our energy issues," Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "serious" to run for the 2020 presidential elections, says Massachusetts Senator
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he must "consider seriously" if he is to run for presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the opening in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he took into account an application.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and for this to require a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously if I run for presidential elections."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during his first meeting, saying that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Twitter Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that no majority of Warren's voters would think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" votes in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such an application.
The poll has shown more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin suffers at a Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after it took place in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"The pains my own son, through which he passed after his return... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of the post-traumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the audience gathered at a rally to support.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant of the chamber" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, harder, wondering if there is still respect for what they and their soldiers from the military and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reports of domestic violence and possession of a firearm in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 States and the District of Colombia contest a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape the violence caused by domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District have completed a friendly application Friday, in Washington, to support a policy contest on asylum-seekers, NBC News reports.
The complainant's full name in the Grace v. Sessions process, which the American Civil Liberties Union organization launched in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a guest", abused her, but US officials refused her asylum on July 20th.
She was held in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations facing a generalized problem with domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has annulled a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council which has allowed undeclared immigrants who are trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law says that all asylum applications must be tried on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such limitation violates this principle," writes friend Curiae in his application.
In addition, lawyers argue in the application that the policy that refuses immigrants to enter affects the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary labour force".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape the abuse and violence of their guests.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of political opinion," Sessions said on 11 June, when the policy announced.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Rescue operations desperate in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a chronometer race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who aligns her baby by suffering from fever to an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
"The ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is not enough."
Residents have begun to return to their ruined homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude of 7.5 on Richter scale, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered fractures in the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated freely because of strong and continuous replicas.
He has eyes full of tears when he recalls how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room from the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then just keep quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propaganda claims"
One week after an official newspaper from China published a four-page advertisement in a US daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the November 6th elections for Congress, an accusation that China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to blend into the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it is a new phase in a Washington escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war, which involves rising import tariffs.
The tariffs imposed by China as a revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters from countries such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said experts from China and the USA.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing injured US workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a newspaper published on Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing advertisements in our own free press".
"When it spreads propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and free press in America," Branstad writes.
"In exchange, at the newspaper shed from here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic journey, given that the mass media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper it is.
Republicans alienate female voters before elections in the middle of the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Since many of the top republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a reaction, especially from women, during the future elections since the mid-term.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and the majority of the Republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will calm down the angry electorate.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, won't forget tomorrow and won't forget in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and spokesman for the National Progressive Group, said Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors launched "Come November!" while protesting on the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among female voters who are undecided in the suburbs and young electorate, between 18 and 29 years of age, who, although not in favour of the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there might be a reaction if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a corner for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh should be confirmed, but also about how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they dealt with it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, said a group of electoral supporters for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe it afterwards.
A new survey conducted by YouTube shows that 41% of respondents believe in State or believe that Ford's testimony is probably true, while 35% said it believed in State or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her, being drunk, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination at the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs to her when she attended a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data archives" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be all available in a single browser, all of a sudden.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company refers to this as "personal consolidation through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is to help Inrupt contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, so that Solid is available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely datad over the head at once.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post published on Medium Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won the Crucea Victoria in World War I is celebrated
The only cleric of the Anglican Church who won a medal Crucea Victoria as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 at Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a lightningman four days later and never knew that he had the highest military honor of Britain.
A memorial stone was developed Saturday by his two nephews during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "beautiful of symbolic" that the stone would be developed exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal of Saint-Quentin "by a very great chaise and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed into the line first and, with "a fantastic advantage", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked himself with an artillery cube and managed to eliminate three of the detachment weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunetist on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “a thing that I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel ashamed”.
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade, which was led by the Youth Orchestra Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him".
MMA fans stayed three all night to see Bellator 206, but got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, the viewers in Britain were amazed when the broadcast was replaced with an episode in Peppa Pig.
Some were not thankful at all because they were three all night to see the battle.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke".
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator's company, said that in the future they will program their events in such a way that they can also be watched by viewers from Britain.
"When I think of replays, I think we could probably solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do this until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about this, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen any more next time.
We're going to sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
Olympic sculptor Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he came to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first show Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay people's rights to give them other "hope".
The athlete also said that when he became a father, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presentation of the tradition show, will miss a few months because of a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "lesser" to others because "I was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength and resistance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that it was "someone," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and benefited from the appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to ask several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without trace, and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The triple world champion said it was "taken by surprise" because it fell in love with a man, American cinematist Dustin Lance Black.
Daley got married last year to Oscar's winning cinematist, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a fragdy age" -- he participated at the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years -- he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same good and bad times.
The two became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, which, says Daley, changed his "whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested only in winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he got tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him "you couldn't be first, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and just after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that I had dreamed of this whole life, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in the chosen music, Proud of Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, went to the reserve bank on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh match of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to return to a good form so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twenty-first time, another record, has been transferred to Captain Jim Furyk's reserve bank for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has been many times for the United States team, the winner of major tournaments divided the day between being a major for the team and playing their beats, hoping that he will correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player has never had the best drives, not even in the best time of his career, so it's not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong hits.
And if the ground is not a pretty big challenge, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the methic champion of the British Open, who joined the news of Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial to Americans, led by four points to the entry into all 12 simple games, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk declared himself confident in his ability to play, but he couldn't have said anything else anyway.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on his shoulder, hugged me and told me he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed very much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was gonna play in two games.
I imagined more, but this happened and this is the way we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like all the others."
Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which no longer stood up at his personal record level.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and seven and a half, although Furyk said his presence has brought some intractable benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, he likes to play with players, he's a great guy in the team's dress," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see him do this during the week.
Its role is more important, it's not just about the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danes began in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to overcome them with a minimum difference of 141⁄2 to 131.2.
"I remember having a considerable advance in Valderrama; I had a great advance in Brooklyn, where I lost, and in Valderrama, where we only managed to win," said Bjorn (in image) after following as the 2018 team, which won with 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now runs with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
“So the story shows me, me and my team, that it’s not ready yet.
We have to play at the maximum tour tomorrow.
Let's get out on the ground and do everything perfect.
The game is ready only after the points have passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
I always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know what lies ahead for us: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his players handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I don’t rush to draw conclusions.
It's all the other thing tomorrow.
Tomorrow's important individual performances, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now leave their partner behind and have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better at testing simply than they did with their partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns the last day: he was in the winning Brooklyn team, then in the losing when Europe succeeded in "Miraculo de la Medina".
"I remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle games.
We created the right lot and ordered the players as we wanted, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was charged with fighting: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I have chosen this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all the subjects," Bjorn said about the lot for simple proof.
Germany's new warship, delayed again
Germany's newest fleet of naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the warships of the Cold War, but this will only happen one year, due to defective systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The entry into operation of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, the standard ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet class, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels commanded by the Military Navy in 2007 will replace the old brakes of the Bremen class.
They are supposed to be provided with a strong ton, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic print.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new fleets to leave for two years without returning to the original port.
However, continued delays mean that these last-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will already be obsolete before entering service, says Die Zeit.
F125 was discussed in the press last year, when Germany's Military Navy officially refused to take over the vessel and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media quoted a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were especially important because Baden-Wuerttemberg vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, only half of the crews of the older Bremen class.
In addition, it was proved that the vessel had a lot of weight too large, which reduced its performance and limited the military's ability to add future equipment.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the German vessels used in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, and the price of the whole project, including the equipment training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said that it has reached a staggering figure of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion), from the initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest sailors end up with the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Commission in the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Military Navy "has begun to remain without vessels that can be sent to missions".
The officer said that the problem has steadily increased over time, because old vessels have been removed without being replaced with some new ones.
It noted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class brakes entered into service within the Military Navy.
National Trust is spying on the secret life of the bats
Our research that is carried out on a property in Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how the lilys use the surrounding environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unedited flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will examine common petals and pigmental lilies, as well as eared lilies and water lilies from the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special registration devices will be located in key locations around the property to track the lily activity during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by lilys and what species emits certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the habitat and a report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are most important for herbicides and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of the zone, and is the best way to maintain forest pastures and other associated species.
The lily populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have dropped considerably in the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development work affecting the cubes, but also the loss of habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are mosquito traps and some chemical treatments for construction materials, but also attacks of domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the press.
They use an eco-friendly technique to accurately identify the insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about lilacs.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct periodic studies, control the cubes and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization has created the first and only lilac reservation in Scotland, on the Thrave mosque in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten species of lilac in Scotland.
Messe's manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here, at Thrave, the area is wonderful for lily," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about lilies, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of looking for lilacs before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as simply unintended destruction of a mother cow could kill up to 400 women and chickens, which could destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their cubs, are prohibited actions.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the Battle Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said: “We still have a lot of learning about bats and we don’t know how the populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers prepare to file a trial in Germany
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will make a claim" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to refer to the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team were accused of rapeing a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375.000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video released on Instagram Live for the 142 million followers of his, Ronaldo, at the age of 33, said they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winning gold balloon in front of the video camera.
"I want her to make a claim using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to trial Der Spiegel for these charges, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says the player will claim compensation for “equivalent moral damage with an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped an anal, according to the documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told him that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Majorga claims that he was addressed to the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later he accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because he had been "destroyed by the possibility of revenge" and was worried that "it would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now looking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the charge, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "but regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
Britain "would regret forever" if it lost world leader status in vehicle production after Brexit, said the business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese auto manufacturer said that the impact of late border traffic on an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory at Burnaston, where the brands Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of the "fix time" principle: for control-made machines, the parts reach 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems at the border could arise which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said the Chequers plan of Theresei May for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy our present success, but also to benefit from this opportunity," he said for today's BBC Radio 4 issue.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, shows that we must continue to use what was a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that large prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the production in the long term and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: "The experience has taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs are no longer returning."
A spokesperson for the government said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says Casa Alba
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "a further week" because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in elections, links between Trump and Russia's aid and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors about the possibility that Trump would release the Deputy Attorney General, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, circled around Washington for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But last month she went to the White House, and reports say she was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump requested an investigation of a week by the FBI regarding the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed again the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week or it may take a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up."
Some reporters would contest this statement: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10th.
Master Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy to TV reporters, who liked to play the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to play the show."
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president participates in several questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"I'll have some briefings," Sanders said, but "I think it's much better for the press to have the opportunity to address directly to the president of the United States, not me.
We are trying to do this most often and you have noticed that we have done this many times in the last weeks, and discussions with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, with an improvised appearance, in bizarre places, in front of the gathered reporters.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on Brexit's issues
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their appreciation on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under conditions where it is less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to bear the costs of applying for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken in this autumn.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare itself increasingly and for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement for the EU's exit.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also outside the European Union, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie is under emergency surgery after having suffered a headache
The founding of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a hit on Saturday's head in the match his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, Mike Organ from Tennessee said.
The leading coach of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
"He got to the shower line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie put the oxygen mask on the shower line by the physical preparations and the medical staff before placing it on a plate and transporting it from the ground for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation to which she was subjected at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/width of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five plates in total before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 plates throughout the season.

The exchange will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising houses with more favourable prices and targeting people with high incomes.
The Court of Justice of the United Kingdom will apply to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
Suprataxa, which is added to the current court tax, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a 3% value.
The Treasury is expected to bring an additional 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are bought by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first house.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending a large part of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the time-limits to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping property prices up to date as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Theresei May to give up taxes on affordable houses in order to solve the "house problem" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a number of attractive proposals for real estate reforms, including rental controls and the cessation of uninhabited evacuations.
He also wants to offer more powerful advice on building new homes.
Theresa May stated: “Last year I stated that I will devote my prime minister’s mandate to the fulfillment of the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying existing problems in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with foreign offices, to be able to buy houses as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of holding a house has become one much too far away, and life in miserable conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the Scottish National Team"
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland football team, said that "the ultimate goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the Scottish national team.
At the age of 42, the Scottish enjoys the challenge of "re-launching" the North Eastern club, which is currently in place 3 in the First League, with a difference of three points towards the first place.
He moved this summer to the team at the Luminian Stadium after he managed, last season, to return to the St. Mirren football team in the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
I'm on national team B and so on," Ross told the BBC Sports Sound.
"But I spent a lot of my childhood chasing Scottish games at Hampden with my father and always wanted me to come back.
But I will have this opportunity only if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland Club, are Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no emotion to be the successor of such dedicated names and to such an important club after he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel successful is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years' experience in driving, after a period when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club come back after he returned to division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrograde, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he feels better now than his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the leadership of the Alloa Club.
“I really thought that I was more suited to the manager than the player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager, with regard to stress and pressure, but I feel that it is a proper role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do this, I feel that it's the best thing I can do for my entire adult life."

The perfect time to drink a beer half is Saturday, at 17:30, according to a poll
This summer's heat wave led to an increase in revenue in the British pubs, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the CGA company providing business consulting services and carrying out the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a type in July, similar to the one in the previous month, when audiences registered up to 2,8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers with 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June decreased even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks recorded a much larger profit than restaurants.
And the pubs serving food have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of restaurants.
Looks like people went out into town just to consume drinks.
Drink sales at the level of all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food dropped by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of the RSM company that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue to be the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
Meteorological conditions and impact of sporting and social events of scale remain among the most important factors contributing to the associated sales of the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the drop in sales of 4.8% a year will be added to current cost pressures.
The canical summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the most moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of new locations launched.
The company monitoring the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, which is the official industry standard.
One of the five children has a secret account on a socialization network he hides from his parents
According to a survey, one of the five children, some even up to 11 years of age, has a secret account on a socialization network hidden by parents and teachers
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in Insta fake accounts
Knowledge increased fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that they show their parents
One in five children, some even up to 11 years of age, creates an account on a socialization network that keeps them hidden from adults.
A survey carried out on a number of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has increased the fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students said they have a "principal" and "clean" account that they show their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who wrongly discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed the position of a teenager who asked to be "violated".
According to research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness Company and the Association of Directors (HMC – Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they hold secret accounts.
HMC Association Director Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers do not have access to.”
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Commission
Elid Doyle was elected Director-in-Office of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual general meeting of the management body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated field and track athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sport to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally in the last decade.
"Eilid enjoys respect for the entire community of athletes from Scotland, Britain and the whole world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits as well as its inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: "I am delighted that I will be able to represent athletes and hope to have a real contribution and can help in how sports activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American Nationality Athletic, who won 200 and 400 meters of evidence at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at BBC, has been invalidated after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
It wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would decide whether or not I would recover.
It was a Titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A health pump advertising that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A health pumping company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment with an advertising that compares mothers who breast-feed their cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video clip, to present the freedom the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a cow-full barn on a melody that includes verses such as: "Yes, I'm mild, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not snakes, they're my breasts."
The refrigeration continues: “I pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, extract milk from girls.”
However, the complaint, published on the company's Facebook page, raised controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video was aimed at mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them declaring it to be "ororie" from the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that they are stolen from their children only a few days after birth," wrote one person.

Another commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "An extremely inappropriate advertisement."
Other people defended the claim, claiming that it seemed a "hilar" claim.
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd have bought one if we were still feeding.
The pump really made me feel like a witch.
The ad is a little inappropriate, but I took it like that.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun commercial targeting mothers who use the pump (usually at work or in the toilet) and who feel like “the cows”.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into the support.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use breast pump say they feel like witches.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly fit in a feeding support, offering women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding children in their arms and even going out of town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing mothers who breast-feed and cows of milk, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that will give the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump gets on the first page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, on the podium, the mother of two children appeared while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a refugee camp from the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of people who have crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have led to the tightening of child placement procedures in sponsors.
Many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and are afraid that they will endanger their country if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, should register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Customs and Immigration Authority, told Congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal history.
"Approximately 80% of those who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we will continue to search for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing in the child system, the authorities introduced new rules that require children to be submitted to the court on a month of detention, and not on 60 days, as provided for by the previous standard, according to the shelters.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal residence status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to the system's shelters and reports in recent months.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are accentuated to a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility of signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to refugee camps without providing them enough time for emotional preparation or to take good care of their friends could cause them trauma, which many of them are already suffering.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish military forces withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are illegally located in an Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be adequately managed".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said during the meeting.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been distraught from their homes.
He further stated that Damascus will continue "this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
There are approximately 2,000 military troops in Syria in the United States, which are particularly involved in training and advising the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war - torn country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moulem stated that there are conditions that are conducive to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading Iraqi fears", which led to refugees staying away.
He added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return".
"Political influences have been brought into a situation that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war-end opposition.
The United Nations diplomats state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to extend the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has contributed to the avoidance of a large-scale attack by the Russian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target the jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, who have links to the Al-Qaeda network and will "be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations emissary, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee composed of government members and opposition to the drafting of a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the country for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the current constitution" and issued an intervention warning.
Why will Trump win the second term
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, unless the removal procedure or the scandals would end his presidential term earlier, which a large part of the Liberal hearing hopes to happen.
In this case, there would no doubt be "the most dramatic end of a presidential term of all time!"
Until now, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, the first-time hearings have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the first-time, the Fox News television station was followed on average by 2.4 million people, four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded a record of audiences, with 3.5 million people following it in the series where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the drama series "President of Reserve" from ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the book's author "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "For making me laugh," Scovell told me.
In chaos, fun is appreciated.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, Washington's action could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can also be full about the state of the global economy.
Exchange of post is a luxury that can only be allowed by the privileged public.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of the debate by a committee of experts on how Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, Fair, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("an object of opulent clothing", according to The Washington Post) and the shocking implications of Stormy Daniels's "anatomical parts" actress.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A large part of what it does gives you the feeling that you look at a reality show and feed on subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Asi Amanet", about the constantly changing distribution and the turning of the daily situation caused by Trump (starting a competition with the American professional football league, the praise brought to Kim Jong-Un).
Don't let yourself lose an episode, because you'll feel that you're left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, there were 27 degrees out there and there was the sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get rid of the TV, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and would decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember performing some of the programs that came out in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right."

Complementary external financial resources for the narrowest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of the electoral districts, which resulted in two holders of the mandate in an electoral course for the same function, it is no surprise that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys cohesive financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh District brought the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another mandate holder in the exercise, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the 12th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania, which is significantly in conflict with 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were not constitutional, manipulating the boundaries of the districts in favour of the Republicans.
The course of the 17th new electoral district launched a competition for funding campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for the Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special elections, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20-point difference.
According to political commentators, the Democrats enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States took into account the penalization of El Salvador because of its understanding with China, but then gave up
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a meeting with the president of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the tromp team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to call American heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions have been taken into account against El Salvador, which received US aid worth approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
As internal meetings have made progress, North American and Central American officials have delayed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But by the middle of September, officials in front of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close member of the administration and who also spoke with the condition of maintaining anonymity.
History study
The next thing that might happen is the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid public evidence.
It also appears that Mueller is also focusing on investigating the existence of a conspiracy between the Trump-Russia campaign with regard to the attack on the US elections.
If the Congress changes, Trump will face the responsibility of the body, even when he prepares to present himself to the electors and may, if necessary, a jury formed by his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, and it is also valid for its counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make, on the one hand, and on the other, of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, the German officers were prepared to give a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
I failed and so lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such critical times right now.
What will we do if Trump calls Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since he reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested the President's secret registration and speculated about his incompatibility with the president's role.
Rosenstein said the Times report was wrong.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with regard to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct, or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakian origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, he emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light up Saturday candles at the table with a whistle.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game
Today, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after the impressive equal in Spain against the Villarreal team from the beginning of the month, will place it in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
An accident on the knees did not allow middleman Graham Dorans to play this season until 2-2 with Villareal, but he considers that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," said the player at the age of 31.
"We started the game by thinking we'd get a good result and won a point.
Maybe we could have written it down at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was the right result.
I think they were better at first, and we noticed better at the second.
Thursday, it will be another important evening for Europe.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, with the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training also goes well.
Let's hope that we will continue, that we will leave behind the past season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia due to pension economies
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about this.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the nationwide company said they discussed the cost of long-term care with the husband/society.
Only 10% of them said they were talking to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't start this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not know your wishes from time to time.
Work with the counselor and the family to discuss the place and how you will get care, because these choices could be a significant factor for cost-setting.
Involve the financial adviser: and the financial adviser can be a real help with regard to the payment of these expenses.
Your long-term care funding options can include a long-term standard insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy in cash, to help you cover these expenses or to ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Step up legal documents: come to legal problems.
Get a medical certificate to designate a person of trust who will monitor your medical care and ensure that your health care professionals respect your wishes if you cannot communicate with them.
Also take into account the implementation of a mandate with regard to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the facts are purchased, if you do not have the necessary ability to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are doing this?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan on all these things."
A man has been shot several times with a compressed-air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle while walking home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30 p.m. as "accidental shootings".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
Hurt wounds don't put their lives at risk, and the police called witnesses to make statements.
earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and is expected to increase the number of deaths.
Due to the interruption of the communication networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala kingdom, an area in the north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Dongala from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the centre of the island of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow Gulf, on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Dongala is a kingdom that extends on a coast with an area greater than 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities are the centre of the province's economy in the centre of the island of Sulawesi, in particular in the Dongala coast region.
Mining activities to extract nickel are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Dongala Regency, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are a few of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of the island of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of the island of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree earthquake on Richter scale hit the southernmost Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested as a result of allegations of violence.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, when a knowledge of his female sex tried to call the police to claim alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su unit, awaiting trial, and is held on the basis of an undeserved guy, worth $500, according to KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where it was declared "100% innocent" when it was requested by the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A offences, which means he could be incarcerated for a period of up to one year and threatened with $250,000.
They were also charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and an amendment of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin's been charged with such charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is pending trial at the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, involving a claim of a domestic violence offence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with an incident.
According to his lover's statement, he gave him a punch.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after he was part of the military forces in Iraq.

The federal prosecution wants a capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York federal prosecution wants a capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a 1953 federal offence.
It appears that Saipov, at the age of 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to make an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side motorway in the Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bikers on his journey in October.
In order to justify capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the opinion of the intention to apply for capital punishment, filed in the South District of New York.
Both defendants may receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
Within a few weeks of the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges, including eight counts of crime in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack needed "substantial planning and pre-medication", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as "hate, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the opinion.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The priest, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy in the commission of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The Rosenberg wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after he looked at the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, as requested.
Also according to the police, he asked to tree the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded as innocent with regard to the 22 heads of prosecution.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said that they are "evidently disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment plea, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutors not to apply capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be in front of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civilian army", during a protest at the Conservator Party's conference.
Ukip's former leader said politicians should "taste pressure" from Eurosceptics, following the statement of a member of Parliament Thesis May who suggested that it should be in the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out" so far if Farage was the Secretary of the Brexit campaign.
However, the challenge May faces with regard to the extremely divided camps was emphasized by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the European Union's departure into the city.
The Prime Minister seeks to ensure that his compromise plan, called the Chequers Plan, is properly implemented, facing the attacks by those who support the European Union's departure, those who want to remain in it and by the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it would continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and would force the Eurosceptic and Labour Party to choose between its offer and "haos".
Bone said in the event of the "Leave Means Leave" movement in Solihull that he wanted "to resign to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and that the associated responsibility should be given to the negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were led by him, I would no longer be in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: "I support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions on changing the public opinion at the 2016 vote: "It is absolutely not true that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people's voices.
"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with him and our activists who are going out and who are supporting us in the elections first.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Theresa May, it added: "The prime ministers who keep their duty are those who keep their promises."
During the meeting, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to "taste pressure" if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let them do this".
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thanks, he added: “You want to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the European Union marched through Birmingham two hours before a meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised a ban on "The Conservative Party is against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security problems they faced in applying the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for digitising customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously think of running for the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke on Saturday about her future during a summit in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the November elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of the Republican Party, who has been co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was in the center of speculation according to which she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the meeting with the number 36 with citizens entitled to vote using the primary format since Trump took over the presidency.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for women to "come to Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this includes finding a woman in his face".
A suspect was arrested in the case of death that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the case of death that caused the death of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dieteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help to identify the man in the images.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University, Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was in front of the place, that he was in possession of a gun, but that he also shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times in the original lottery last season and playing on average 17.4 minutes with 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will play an essential role in the race.
Being in the first position in the classroom, Bottas had a good start and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two tours and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and left Hamilton at the group's line, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped at the boxing a later tour and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after several schemes that forced Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row of the carioja and was in the place close to the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he stood in the front for a large part of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to get over Kimi Raikkonen and take over four.
Finally, he stopped at the 44th tour box, but couldn't make it through the last eight tours, Raikkonen staying in place four.
“It was a difficult day. Valteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a true gentleman, letting me go through.
And the team did an excellent job to win in front of the Ferraris and to accomplish this double," Hamilton said.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday, in a meeting on his insistences as she did not facilitate the "run" of Christine Blasey Ford's letters, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, of sexual aggression.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "wicked, immoral and false".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see a mania, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying," he said.
"When you see that they published and published information and then say they didn't.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Diane Feinstein if she made it easier to "run" the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Uh... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "scarlet" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "scarlet" occurred from her office.
"I didn't hide the accusations that I'm looking at Ford and I'm not the one that made it easier to "run" her report," Feinstein told the committee, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep my privacy and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not seem to have been good for the president, who commented during the Saturday's meeting: "If I am honest, it was a horrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but she was the most horrible body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
"They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the evil, the immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediate website.

An air traffic controller died after securing the decommissioning of a plane with hundreds of passengers during a crash
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after he secured the decommissioning of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a strong earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Several powerful replicas took place in the area, and many people are trapped under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, Antonius Gunawan Agg, aged 21, refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was a strong one.
It remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air, which is on the track at that time, would be safe.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He died at the hospital later.
The spokesperson for Indonesia's air navigation service provider said it is possible that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I prepared a helicopter has to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"We are suffering from this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency declaring that access is limited in the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will rise, because many victims are still under the rubble and we have not had access to many of them," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Valeries with a height of up to six meters have devastated the city of Palu, on Sunday to take place a common burial.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “In every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minicarts are stolen."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to help its survivors, but we do not know what they will find in front of the place.
It's already a tragedy, but you could get worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", CNN announced.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, which fought with more than 550 deaths.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline holding the plane crashing into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now declared that a person is missing, after previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
It also mentioned that it is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The United States Air Company and the United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the landing track and got into a lake beyond that.
Some witnesses think the plane exceeded the end of the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which reached the bridge, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the shipmates panicked and yelled and that he suffered a minor head wound.
The United States Naval Forces said that the mariners who were working close to refueling a landing boat jumped in aid, using an inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks at 30 meters below the water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of aircraft registered in PNG for the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed his plea with regard to reopening the trial for a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury the way he used his mobile phone records to take over Quinton Tellis' actions, at the age of 29, as well as his victim Jessica Chambers, at the age of 19, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Telllis was with Chambers the night she was killed, this being in contradiction with his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in a witness box and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies was that Telllis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicate that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
According to time, the defense will begin its final prayer Sunday.
The judge said he was suggesting that the jury would decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the hip-hop conscious?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way in which this kind of music has been seen, with positive messages.
The High Breed Corps, from Bristol, maintains that the hip-hop has stopped transmitting political messages and addressing social problems as it did at first.
They want to return to their origins and make the hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Escapes and Commons in the United Kingdom was observed through such artists as Akala and Lowkey.

A New Yorker sues a couple for firing after receiving a "racist" text message
A New York judge gives a couple in court for the dismissal for discriminatory reasons after he has received a text message from his mother, complaining that it was "another person of color".
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that they had been tried for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his disgracing when she found out that the new father, Giselle Maurice, was of color, when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After she realized that she felt embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her father-in-law, who is African-American, had not fulfilled her duties properly and that she was expected to receive a grant of Filipino nationality according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she gives the couple in court to be awarded compensation for the dismissal and asks for a sum of 350 dollars a day for six months, the period during which she had to live with them and carry out her activity, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said to the Post newspaper on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the claims that they were racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice, because they feared that I could no longer trust her after they stabbed her.
"My wife sent him a wrong message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But have you left your children in the hands of a person you have made a mistake about, even if it is wrong?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process an "extortion" action, Plasco said that his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
It doesn't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is under way, the public opinion has accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have proven.
The editors of Paddington's stories feared that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a bear who speaks, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following things about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
It further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would be optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of books was a "sweet-sweet" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success he later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to be praised," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not yours.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to stay on my phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"I hope it often calls to tell me that it is very serious and that it does not think it will survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a call from Nad telling me he'll die in the next two minutes and that I have to take good care of her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications administered to keep her heart pumping blood began to decrease and get out of her body.
He died a little while ago and the organs began to fail.
I was forced to stay there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I was supposed to be in control."
In the end, Ednan-Laperous, in despair after his daughter died, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what was going on.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two grieving women place different messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a Gallo Bridge, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, aged 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a mollusive smile.
"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile changed your mood."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had arrived at a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said: "I still think you will have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to convey to people that I can call someone or that I can talk to someone, even a friend.
Exterminate yourselves, you have to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' many-year-old friend, lost Mark, the life partner he had when he was 15 years old, at a time since his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he's not feeling well or he's depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that his attitude changed.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas day, when the children gave their gifts and didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but she had to overcome it: “He caused a tremendous pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the launch of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking – an investigation over a limited period of time and limited scope – we could have a little unity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the Commission is about to "disengage", on the basis of a partial blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their retardation is due to the entire time factor.
There are only five weeks left before the elections of 6 November - if, as is suggested, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they wish winner in the elections for the highest court in the country will be significantly weak.
George W. Bush has always called the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees falling under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong- one came into power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from South Korea's unification ministry, said that last year approximately 1.127 people fled the country, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were the more severe border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs perceived by those carrying illegal persons across the border.
The Phenian didn't make any public comments.
A large majority of the refugees in the north are finally offered to South Korean citizenship.
Seul officials declare that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most refugees across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers refugees to be more illegal migrants than refugees and often repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still practically in the war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met with Phenian for several discussions that had been the subject of negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between American Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to cooperate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, in no case will we be the first to be unilaterally disarmed," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as being "sterical", declaring that he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the democratic minority of the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as "sterical", and said that his temperance was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of the fact that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's legal commission, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied charges that Christine Blasey Ford would have been sexually harassed when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost yelled and lost his voice because of his emotions, while discussing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the commission, calling charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated murder of character", organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said it is of the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony has demonstrated that he cannot serve at the Supreme Court, because he has shown that he has a divisive character against the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualified by those statements and by the way he attacked the Clinton family and democracies," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when he was asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if it doesn't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not right, not only for the Supreme Court, but not for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of the District of Columbia.
Pelos added that, as a democrat, she is concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Law accessible to care or case Roe versus Wade, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether it would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a goat, a partner, to go to court and wait for us to say "oh! what a wonderful!" said Pelosi.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a justified diarrhythmia, it's months and years of accumulated anger and it can't talk without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received a significant help from a woman who has an executive function, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she was angry and began to cry, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a great thing."
The tears are allowed for the outpouring of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I began to cry because of an inexplicable rage, is that I was caught by the head of a older woman, a cold manager to whom I always felt a bit of fear, and took me to the house of the stairs.
"I never have to see you crying," she told me.
“I don’t know that you’re angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad you've caused this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Colorado State Congress, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason why she should not even run for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as the Snow and the Seven Pits".
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she wouldn't get in the race unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, they gave them only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – as a result of recognition for the people who supported it, by the frustration caused by the system and by the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and to visit voters instead of delegates, but also by the anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice because of his emotions.
"You would have said that I have a nervous crisis," Schroeder recalls about the press's reactions to her.
"You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're going to write on my funeral stone.
"Was she crying?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
Saves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were austerity and, although there seems to be a long way to its end, disputes between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, first issued a warning early this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling), applying, in effect, taxes for half of all Chinese goods arriving in the U.S. territory.
Beijing has been remunerated every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5% and 10% for American products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every hit from the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will take a step backwards in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its requests, but public surrender to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing is playing its books well, the US trade war pressure could positively support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or in Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would, in fact, be more dangerous than what has been recommended so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for better than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation is improving.
"Today, the conditions in front of the site are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they were required to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at day-to-day life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from an insurgent-sponsored country would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after winning the American team with a final score from 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe came back first after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial water strike to the 3rd of the 16th Gate, giving it to Francesco Molinari's match.
Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all reviews, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current format of the tournament, from 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost at 5th and 4th holes in front of the player from the last place in the European team's rankings, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The leading player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost at 2nd and 1nd Streets in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last match in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with most victories, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It is a teamwork and I am glad that I could be of help," Garcia said, excitedly after the European victory.
It teaches his countryship, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game, on Sunday.
"I am very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the games when I was a child," said Rahm, at the age of 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played amazingly throughout the tournament.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of them, they have even tried.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a battle with clumsy.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with PGA of America and our Committee for the Ryder Cup and we'll go further.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us."

According to the Commission, the conditions of ununiformity are reported in the areas of the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier committees – which suggests a decrease in concentrations.
This inflorescence of the red sea extends to an area of about 210 km from the north of the Pinellas committee to the south of the Lee committee.
The caves can be found about 16 km away from the Hillsborough committee, but in less places than last week.
The Red Sea was also observed in the Pasco Committee.
Average concentrations found in or outside the Pinellas committee were reported last week, as well as lower levels up to high in the Hillsborough committee, background concentrations up to high in the Manatee committee, background concentrations up to high in or out of the Sarasota committee, background concentrations up to medium in the Charlotte committee, background concentrations up to high in the Lee committee and beyond and low in the Collier committee.
Respiratory irritations in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier committees continue to be reported.
No cases of respiratory irritation in the northwestern state of Florida have been reported in the last week.
