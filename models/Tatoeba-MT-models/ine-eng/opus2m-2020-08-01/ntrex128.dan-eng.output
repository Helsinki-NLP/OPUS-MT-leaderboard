Politicians in Wales fear to "like fools"
There was prejudice among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly on a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs.
It is because of plans to change the name of the House to the Welsh Parliament (the Wallisian Parliament).
AM's from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is expressed in Yorkshire-English.
Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legislative proposal for the introduction of the amendments, said: "The final decision on the names that Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the Members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Valisian Members) or WMPs, but MWP was given the highest support in public consultation.
The AMs propose apparently alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement can prove difficult for the President of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to draw up a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The draft law on reforms contains other changes in the way in which the Assembly is working, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs receive the final vote on what they should be called when the bill is discussed.
Macedonians are voting on the change of the country's name
The electors vote on Sunday whether or not their country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbours' name constitutes a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will sign the vote.
Members of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is only a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's remain silent while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I spoke to said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways today," he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the district's living room where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money that was collected to sell assets does not last long and that they "before or after they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of people who do not help the return of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy real estate in these buildings are white," he says, "and it inspires further development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most people who move into the real estate will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was in charge of a boycott of 125th Street stores, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s son-in-law made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clock game.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the clock "the poor's watches".
The expert who played the clock game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find any compensation for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and contractors. Some of them were obtained by church leaders, others by the bishop.
In July, the Council of the Congregation – the leading body of the Socene, consisting of leading laymen – wrote to the bishop about concerns that the bishop "try to push the expenses forward" to the Council of the Congregation, even though the Council of the Congregation had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who the bishop sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Hi hurts 13-year-olds on diving after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, when he drowned after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had drowned with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group rushed over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just a thrill to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his demands were lifted up," said Hamle, "he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hamle.
The boy was flew to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It is unclear what kind of shark there attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said by a media letter that there was a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to carry out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to take up the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with ranges of beauty products with special assistants in style with stores.
As part of a great effort to take up the British beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and housing products are falling. The larger series of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as the supermarkets look for new products to be used for television, microwave and residential products.
Sainsbury's says they double their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees also get more space with burnt areas in style with them, you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs the range of Boutique-makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop tastes the fragrance shop lives in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a development against the purchase of small quantities of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Director of Sainsbury's, has said that shops are going to look like stores, while the supermarket is taking up the fight with Aldi and Lidl discount chains by introducing several services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites, since they both bought chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily goods and have made the purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute about how to distribute the profits of the pharmacists in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury leather care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and layout of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in particularly trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our selection of fires is designed to suit all needs and the absorbing environment and practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "Rassen", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' De-star Peter Jones left "racing", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories fire True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This Morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she was leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' The Star Peter Jones angry, after she withdraws from their luxurious lifestyle at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "racing", as the popular TV woman during a busy Tuesday meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had time for their home product and accessories brand True.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated 11 million GBP property.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left True while Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the main quarter of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the release from this Morning host, which is one of the highest-income stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company several million because of major investments in products – from powder to stearin to clothing and household products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it can also end in a long friendship.
Mother to three Willoughby and housewife Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up True together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples travel together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby has to be a fire ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin who was on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment "not worthy of a president" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody at a newsstand.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a meeting more, after Trump launched their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear freeze in North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear fission have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "comparable reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that the United States, instead, continues with sanctions designed to keep the press running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"There was a beginning to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim’s relationship had produced positive results – ending rockets, helping to release hostages and sending back earthly remnants from American military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It is so easy to behave in a state, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this densely packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes are rising and killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations, for example, were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were homeless, no state of national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," Sumbang said.
While Save the Children composes a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, speaker for the national disaster response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami resorts are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently there is a lack of a tsunami, and it has probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lack of infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and two-wheelers.
However, Mr Jokos' administration has been plagued by lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge compares last minute to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League to Chelsea with a score on the 89 minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri a few 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was back with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot against the most remote pillar.
The ball flew high over the field against the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and entered the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get into the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a simple touch, and I didn't think so much about it, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at midnight, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with the heel to Mateo Kovacic before he set speed up on the main track and sprinted into the Liverpool part.
Kovacic made a quick one-to-two on the midway.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended up against the most remote pillar with a shot with the left foot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group game in the Champions League at 15 o'clock on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 15 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832 indicates the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many prisoners were reported to be trapped in the bricks from buildings falling after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the right scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by bricks from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man at 32 under suspicion of murder, after a woman is drowned to death
A murder investigation has been initiated, after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who saw or heard anything about going forward.
Police assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I will invite all those who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to call on all, in particular, tax collectors, who may have taken up something with the Dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A spokesperson for the police has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman are here to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police say they are about to inform the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but he's told the police that nobody has to get into the building.
He was lame when he heard what had happened.
People now know that there are several hours to go before they can get back in.
A police officer was interrogated to tell a man that the whole area is now considered a place of action.
A crying woman is coming.
She keeps repeating, "It's so scary."
At 14 a.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another car outside.
A number of officers stood in front of the lockdown and monitored the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
The status of the Cromwell Parliament will be the most recent commemoration of the debate on the "recast of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England that were carried out by his fanatic, puritanic followers.
But Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "gallery" and a "try to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The picture storm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing depiction of Cromwell is a testimony of positions in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worth praising.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against extreme pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate picture is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents one side of the struggle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth praising and remembering."
Dræbergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only under his last name "Yuan", was found dead with an overcrowded pulse year and intruded in blood near a graystyte on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pig injections with vaccines at a pig-use on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He had evidently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the greyhound next to him was open.
He said there was a big ore with blood in his mouth.
A medical examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had been killed by the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's bones were bloody and sick," said the cousin, who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a bull weighing 295 kg a Welsh farmer against his tractor, entering his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "trigger".
"They're just medically ill.
The nerves, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves across the cooler water on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rains with floods in northern Mexico and in the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had a win of 38 m/s, a category 1-orcan, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low-pressure discharge across the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture into the north into the southwestern USA.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Afterwards, the tropical moisture will interact with the coming low-pressure exhauster and will create heavy rain in the South-West in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storms, liquid rainfall and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
The tropical moisture will produce rain up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the South-West USA, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform valves into bulging rivers and droughts will create strong local winds and create dust.</seg>
The approaching low-pressure exhauster will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which may give less fluid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in its rainy season.
Scattered tropical rainforests will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners on Tuesday and continues on Wednesday.
In October, there can be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes cooler, but there is still a fairly warm climate in the tropical.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern USA are expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that temperatures above the average in the eastern United States are very likely in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million witnesses were arrested on Thursday from the nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was reportedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the general programmes to tell about the late development of Friday: an agreement concluded by Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the prosecutors.
Ford told the senate's judgment committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was in a state of anger against her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional statement that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it Friday.
The company recorded average sights on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available viewers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a game number corresponding to a match under the NFL playoffs or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion bars have been strongly backed up by the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republicans issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for opening CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, while demonstrators called to him when he tried to take a lift to the hearing in the judgment committee.
He was looking down for several minutes while he was kicked out, and CNN sent him alive.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the TV stations covered live a few hours later, when the ruling committee would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are under the Senate, had asked for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made her decision.
Flake's choice was influenced because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "legitimate politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "legitimate politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the conservative party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson presented his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected to stand behind LSU's death
Police have arrested a suspect for shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Ditheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and put in prison under suspicion of reckless manslaughter, the police said in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police said he had confessed the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set to $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The judge in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, where it was said that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot shot that went from head to neck.
The Police Department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, State Police Laboratory, Police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "meat and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team was "knocking" and "in shock" over the death of Waydes.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano Spears Over Mexico City
Aske, which is spicy from the Volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the volcano, after which activity occurred in the crater, and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded for 24 hours.
The center monitored the rolling and shaking over several circles.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ashes on car wheels in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the right scale, the central Mexico in September 2017 shook.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police meet with Catalan separatists in advance of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, following demonstrators who wanted independence, met with uro-deputies as thousands took part in rival demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists kept the uro-stork back, threw with and dust painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also battles later on the day the police used their staff to keep the fights down.
Over several hours, independent groups called "nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and met with Unionist demonstrators who called "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries occurring during the protests reported the local press.
The vote continued to be very intense in the less independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted to an overwhelming extent for independence, but the voter's membership was low, and those who opposed the liberation boycotted the large-scale vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polls throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped at night on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer gave up hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they were given a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain the moment, and many of their best-known leaders are either themselves in exile or in detention and await them for their role in the holding of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone as support for the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be more and more tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had waited for his case last year, announced that he would vote for the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to withdraw from the retreat of democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, by house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested, after a car several times entered a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A towel against the car may also have been fired at a time.
Shooting from Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The fans of Livingston surrounded Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team pulled up side by side with the Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won out of the league this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they're eight points after, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers will receive a visit from Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, in return, expands their unconquered stripes into six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has still not received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chance against cash default
Holt's team should have been ahead of long before, they scored, and their direct gaming style created big problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit off the target, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halket's cross-head in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give up problems in the event of death.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers started a fresh park, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together the layout of Menga, which made a touch and scored from the center of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but he struggled to get through the defense of his home, and Mr. Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos withdrew a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was dismissed with the feet of the Rangers target Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame in another of the Livingstone deadly situations.
There were ongoing deliveries into the Livingstone field, but was rejected, and two demands for a penal park – after Halket's call on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball – were rejected.
" Phenomenal" by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastically and exceeds the expectations of their uphill journey.
Their style of play and troupe are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were many heroes.
The leader Halkett was great and was leading a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on his toes throughout the fight.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under the level.
Their conclusions lacked sharpness – only once they got their home team – and it is a good wake-up for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approaches to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police, held for security reasons, assembled a total of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a lot of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to oppose the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a whole of some German Turks and the hustle as an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
Unhappily, the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street took place, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car, whose driver escaped from the scene, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform him of his concerns.
There are roadblocks installed, bus routes installed, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured during anxiety
Six prisoners have been injured in a high-security prison under the terms of the Prison Office.
There was anxiety in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the riots are still under way.
Specialized "Tornado" officer is picked up to handle the riots involving eight employees and taking place in one flight of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor facial damage on site.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison employees are being deployed to deal with the current problems in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we're clear about that those responsible are being reported to the police and can end up spending more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 employees, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, carers were summoned to prison to deal with serious problems where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storms (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure hits Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remnants of the hurricane Rosa move over the desert landscape in the south-west of the United States and create a risk of storm floods.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about storms for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "the tropical cyclones had maintained their status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to reach 25 to 51 mm with an area of 102 mm.
For those outside the risk of storms, Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the Southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to American drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the next highest category," reports weather.com.
First, hurricane Rosa is expected to hit the country on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has energy in the morning with a maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north with 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power Monday afternoon or evening.
The account of parts of Mexico can become strong and pose a major risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm precipitation is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora with up to 254 mm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border to Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the rest of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwest desert area of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storms and liquid rainfall in deserts and earthquakes in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, says the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on all those who had to have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was under the democratic party's "woe and anger"
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and vicious tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "evil, anger" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness in front of the convention on Thursday and strongly and emotionally charged statements from Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually abused for her for decades when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice at the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most powerful legal brains in our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of Republicans meeting at the polls in the Middle East.
"At five weeks there is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "fight against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a person in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the death toll grows
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were driven away from the mighty waves that hit the beach, when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, when up to six meters of high waves hit the coast at stormy time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami emerged after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the right scale.
"When the tsunami erupted yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not run the same and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunamien didn't come alone, the dragged cars, wooden trunks, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before the affected coast.
More succeeded in surviving by climbing up trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster facility has published air photographs showing many ruined buildings and shops, ruined and destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Reserving services continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be seen in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Board for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted during the Great Earthquake of Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami larger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed together.
The corpses of a number of victims were found stuck under the cracks of ruined buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Dongala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living here," said Red Cross in a statement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticised on Saturday from many fronts not to disclose that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately shouts warnings about the coming tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings at the same time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that disrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Visions employees from Dongala have come safely to Palu city, where employees are looking for light during performances that are set up in the garden of their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the way, Dosebah said.
"They said they had so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organizations began their hard work of restoring relief work, they complained that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and foreign workers must only be introduced if the area in which the accident occurred is declared to be a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it is a national disaster', we can open up for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the missing people were held in hopes that their loved ones would become the miracles that shed light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a cop.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under bricks for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding country team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those who were caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandadi, were among his students.
"As a veterinarian in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how in the hours, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel circulating in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent whatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one cry of flueben instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes 26.750 USD while filling cash machines in Newport on the Livee
Twenty Friday morning, 26.750 USD was stolen from a Brink's ansate, which was about to fill a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had emptied the money machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, criminal assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "back to Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that was supposed to have been delivered.
There were so many suspects who fled, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All with information on the identity of thieves are requested to contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name to Ye.
He announced the shift on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "The creature was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had named Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaced Ariana Grande's songs on the show, which was cancelled by "sensitivity reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the string is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th year of a bloody rebate against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968 and killed 300 at a time when left-wing student movements hit many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening up more free, open universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education include young people in criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they use in field research, the investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, according to various parts of the U.S. government, reports on artificial intelligence, but the US still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation within artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," Lee said.
Doubled the budget could double the chances of the next great performance of artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the top-ranked U.S. Othello players, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of the Google Department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the American government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come, so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to achieve government legacys, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs within artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
The Chinese State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than USD 100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to establish a national commission for artificial intelligence, has been silent for several months.
Macedonians are voting on the change of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's efforts to gain EU and NATO membership.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbours to the north constitutes a requirement in Greek territory and has therefore used their vetorate when Macedonia has sought entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the primary slave population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the voter will represent the 50% required for the vote to become valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?"
Members of the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the country's future, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the EU's umbrella, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote and make it applicable.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 p.m. there were no irregularities reported.
However, electoral participation was only 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong home in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the vote in Macedonia on a change of country name that would open up for NATO and EU membership in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje prepared Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small stage and chaired the tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to get membership with a travelling pan, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a strong investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think that a large majority will vote because more than 80% of our citizens go to the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "security of our future".
A poll issued last month by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required vote.
Another observation made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provincial Government since it entered last May.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights throughout Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the central track at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran fast past three Brighton defenders before he went out on open ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender and ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English front used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boots to list the intended target of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," the City Manager told the Pep Guardiola reports.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target right now."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate leap in the Premier League fight.
The target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling against the most remote pillar.
Sky Blues forward pointed the ball in the net, just before the slide passed the target.
City is fighting Hoffenheim in the group game at the Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will drill Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take up the castetuen Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participating in the playoffs for Rockies, which has played a fight more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild card slot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest enough level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited about playing under those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet announced the start-up to Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer into such a situation.
Scherser, who would be the first man on the plate for the 34th time, trained his cast Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his holiday.
The right-hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans meeting at the polling stations in the middle of the elections.
"All we've done is in the game in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to get the power back with all the means available.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to run over to get power and control.
The Democrats, he said, have as mission "fight against and block."
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "wrath and evil and rebellious and false."
He referred to the senior democratic senator of the Senate's judging committee Diane Feinstein by name, which triggered a loud bang from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you close the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a space party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am only the last in a number of Members from Labour who have learned that we are not welcome – only because we have made our point.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship went out to criticize me because I disagreeed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems in which Jeremy was opposed to former leaders.
At the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday we said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament, the meetings were just like this on Friday night.
Unfortunately, today the tone in many meetings is not like this, and the "favourer, happier" policy law is far behind in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed on whether the party's management can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy was led, when colleagues, whom I previously thought I shared political position with, began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and that is really just as much what I say – a long strike follows messages from the social media calling for a choice and rejection of the mid-term policy and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the will to fight among colleagues who are overwhelmed every day by sexism or racism, but still struggles further.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour was to create a tolerant culture.
In fact, however, it is no longer a spatial organization and with every vote of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that if I lay down on myself and I'm not so hard, I'm gonna have to "get up."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of bankruptcy, and I sat down to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been a city council member or a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, nor in my last choice.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current management.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country turns against Brexit, which would harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local electors, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threats to choice or political fitness will deter me from acting on what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr Becomes Tophold
Two late scores may have got the final result of drawing a not quite true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tennant's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end it was as much of their superior defense as their better use of the chance that carried home the household, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our fights have been demanding so far, and we are still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the Warriors' fight, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty park just before midnight. He scored and then got a solo score, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruarid Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was dragged out of the track on bars. When the game was resumed, Ayr stepped up with a score from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent kick from Climo.
Functioning Ayr leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and once again Melrose used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without subsequent kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to pick up Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the upcoming Ayr.
Climo followed up with a kick in the stairs and followed up with a more almost immediately after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent flyers Gregor Henry off to the fifth round of the home track.
Set up the Game stars looking for new careers in the restaurant industry
The game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restaurant industry, after it came to light that he has taken the director's post for an authorised restaurant.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person together with his partner Greg Hemfill.
Duoen has announced that the next ninth season will be the end of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of Agringermorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source indicated to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the main quarters of the fleet, trapped in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a sea-blue flag.
River bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are over-painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the country, Bolivia has been reminded of a coastal stretch that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, still strong, and the same is the desire to sail on the Pacific again.
Perhaps the hopes are at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years' vote.
"Bolivia has a moment, a feeling of community and clarity, and of course awaits a positive view of the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will provide Bolivia with information that Chile, after several decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the trial's rejection Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
However, analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia's party – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly in the Netherlands has no power to exceed Chilean territory and has provided that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice dismissed them only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given up.
"The case of access to the sea has been taken away by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morale's war rhetoric has done it with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years with disagreements and gain benefits for both parties", he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political crack.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there's no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never break down their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises made at a summit in Singapore among the rival leaders.
His comments were extended by the fact that US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a restart of the fixed nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a 'desire dream' to continue sanctions and the U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is reluctant to make a statement, as long as Pyongyang has not only taken a significant step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a more summit.
But there is widespread speculation as to whether Pyongyang is serious about destroying an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month as a preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashionshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne raised on the catwalk the veil for a collection of remarkable main clothing in extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down on the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a surpassing wide shade that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewelry and even an pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had mixed lips that mentioned more about Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled dive gear with snorkel and mask, and others resembled a melted wafflelis.
And if you're going to continue the big Modest Estimates, you're lucky.
Stilspeckers predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The fighting hats arrive in the hills of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shade that has been seen all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the most impractical hatred spread over the social media has sent a new great creation down on the catwalk – a beach bag in the street, which is almost as big as the model that shows it.
The orange bastch with bast cheeses and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in general stores next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in combat size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many fine academic results behind them, and it continues in 2018 with a number of outstanding exam results, which are strengthened in the above purchase by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can compose and implement a tailor-made pendulum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike his heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot only stay in English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest results of the exam this year that language is the highest in statistics with most of the ongoing exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade A.
The data collected by the 74 member schools of SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students received the character A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now viewed as a subject selection at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to hold vacancies, 17 % of their language skills were lacking.
Thus, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
Several job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career they choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a boost to competitors.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 respondents in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multidigit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially from developing countries, you give your children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there are differences between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important to Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required for success regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scotland's youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets the debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening game before the season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still doesn't matter how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' scheduled six matches before the start of the season.
"Where I am in my career I don't have to fight before the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a stripping election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judges for the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is in vain, Trump is trying to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, takes place at midnight (Danish time) between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were prompted by allegations of sexual misconduct, and the expected vote of the Senate confirmation has been held for a week while the FBI investigates the defendants.
However, the primary objective of this stripe electorate is to create a moment for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the next week's five electorate meetings aim "to create energy among volunteers and support them when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign time," said a speaker for the Trump campaign, which would not be quoted as names, to Reuters.
Tonight's election meeting is held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come up to give him a boost in the measurements," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown off and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's unicorn
After three one-sided rounds, the four-man duels of the day might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging moment pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but a concept that players believe – not least in competitions like this.
So where would they say there's a moment now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we'll see it a little bit as a moment," said Jordan Spieth before he held the quadrant.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have some wind in the sails, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheerings got higher, as the round continued, and Spieth struck an important well that ensured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two blows behind two duels.
His well who assured them of the struggle on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe that the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength ahead and focus on your own fight," Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the greatest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sympathetic couples have got four points in four matches, and appear to be free.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the manner in which energy appears to flow both to and from the wild audience shows that it is those that are the hardest to beat Sunday. And it would certainly be very popular if a potential European victory is held by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Anyway, the sync on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, in the morning just in the four-man duels, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swedish down into a hole they were never close to coming out of.
Sunday, there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two hold a two players are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way that the strategy can quickly change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made a significant lead before the last day, but the four-member duoers have also shown that Team USA has the champion that some, especially in the USA, have doubted.
Europe creates the 10-6 front of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 ride across the United States.
The successful duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods and have thus far gained four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the podium they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The United States provided more resistance in fursomes. They won four matches, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team should use eight points in Sunday's 12 single fight if they're to keep the podium.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in turn, and he and Molinari, who together have received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second couple in Ryder Cups history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs and then defeated elegantly an impeccable Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought during the first two games on Saturday, had little genius, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven.
Justin Rose was delighted to attend the morning's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has as much as they want it, on a light day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being back with four points before the single fights. However, when Furyks currently has the podium, they only have to get it undecided to keep it.
After having been the second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack Sunday.
North Korea says they will not weaken unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would increase their mistrust to the United States and that the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the general meeting of the world-wide organization that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, developing an area of nuclear testing and not allowing for further development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and take the least unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-separated" access to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took steps. However, his speech seemed important as it did not explicitly reject unilateral disarmament, as it had previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint release from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a seated US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "nuclear decommissioning in the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal conclusion of the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to the outbreak of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can get us to knees is a wish dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a more summit between Kim and Trump, as highlighted by the US leader at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If nuclear weapons were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the USA, the negotiations would not be so closed."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ris was very different from the last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korea's missiles against the US mainland was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide.
Last year Trump threatened the United Nations with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he urged Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions must remain until North Korea collapses.
On Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timetable for these actions, but said "It's just as much if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear decommissioning."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased its financial sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines during the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea was only a few hours after accusing him of "walking demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and an atomic complex if the United States took "a corresponding step."
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps", he demanded, were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards a normalization of Washington's relationship.
Student at Harvard takes a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counter the growing macho culture where you study all night long held up by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the best university in the world often do not feel the first thing to do.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after holding a lecture on what effects sleep deprivation has on learning.
"When the show was over, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get to know this first when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to the students how good sleep habits can improve one's academic and sports performance as well as one's overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university’s health field, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleeplessness during the week.
The hourly course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, wardrobes, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how your sport performance is affected by sleep deprivation and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We know well that it will not change the students' behavior at the same time.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking a "all nighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to a growing shortage of sleep.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and enough sleep," he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who is studying chemical and physical biology, last year helped Professor Cheisler organize the course when he took one of his courses at his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next stage will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up an alarm so they know when to sleep and when to sleep. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can shake at the rhythm of the day and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Measurements from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
Rangers led another defeat on the highway, when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistency team had to thank a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The held from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the stage since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrad only another defeat in 18 matches as a coach. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Mass hit to seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Ranger team could not respond to.
Rangers are now smoking down in a sixth place, while Livingston is demanding on a third place after Hibernian with only the target score to the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, since line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a thrown object that looked like to come from the subway section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the layout that reached the Betfed Cups semifinal by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood up with the same 11, which barbed a point of Hearts' conduct last week, and he would have been glad to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents throughout the course.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes in the match, when Menga's first surrender sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the mid-stage player's attempt was over.
A fresh park in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow fired past the rearmost pillar.
Rangers took control, however, but played more on hope than ability in the attack.
Alfredo Morales was not satisfied at all, when Judge Steven Thomson subpoenaed the Colombians' appeals for a penal park, when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter game.
Rangers only managed to shoot two targets in the first half, but former Rangers goalman Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's main hit and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livis' opening in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said that he deserved their efforts alone.
Again Rangers couldn't handle a deadball situation in the depth of Jacob's.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga who could easily shoot it.
In the break Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave way when the pilot sent the ball into Morelos, but the successful Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the crowd to play on their prizes with many long balls up on the path from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the last part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacob with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the target.
Rangers' replacements Glenn Middleton once again called for a late penal park after being dry with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked this other way.
Arch: The inventor of the treasurer
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago – if we... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would in the future lead to the apparatus known as the gear counter.
The Geiger counter has become a fixed component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as peasant scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you turn on these main phones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals does."
Evans, "Stop it! Now there's a time in it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune defense to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of removing immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many forms of cancer and where they were injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancers.
When an egg cancer woman was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune defense to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, which many cancer forms have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several forms of cancer to develop", including breast, ovaries, lungs and intestines, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are taken out of patients and "learn" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech conducted a MAGA-hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't work out.
After an unprecedented performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was moved by the fact that he congratulated the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would stand up as President in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town introduced a Make America Great Again, he started at a dinning speech against the Democrats and held his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people, who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have moved away from the United States for too long," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's Legal Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's attacker.
Even though the footage was not shown, the comedian Chris Rock Wests recharged the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to expose West by putting up the footage.
In addition, West complained to the public about bad treatment backstage due to its main clothing.
"They raped me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They raped me!
And they said I was fucked up," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I am down?" and said that he would take his Superman hat on because it means that "you can't decide what to do.
Try with love."
Publium buked at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff let torturously concerned, Variety informs with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomb silence in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose present boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: TAKE NOT TO LET YOU KUE OF THE PÖBLEN."
Talkshow's Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "like he is, and it's totally fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and exudes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a name call for the "entity officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapcollege Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently dead musictender Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Know as Prince.

The visits are reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to swing swords in the role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he believed there was "something wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much in mind".
"At the moment it is very important for me – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He continued: "What is born, and what is born?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think it is one of the major issues of our time – how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not make successors to the Game of Thrones when the series ended next summer, and said that he was "complete with battlefields and horses".
From November on, Kit is involved in a replay of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it gave me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, like Kit's character, Jon Snow, is in love with, in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the birthplace of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, as reported by the health authorities.
Only 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
Long most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in the Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women before or since because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff missing data on republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied on Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the claims originated from websites and supported by the "extreme right wing".
"False, lie and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter survey.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday on the Internet by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. It occurred during a hearing in the Senate of allegations of sexual assault against the high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages that Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which the published information about a member of the Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated charge is completely unfounded and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unwarranted charge is completely unfounded and a direct lie."
Waters' release was quickly criticised online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a congressman.
If you get blamed for something you haven't done, you don't have to get angry.
You don't have to be honest.
There is no need to question the accused's motives.
You have to keep your mind shut."
Fleischer allowed the Waters' reaction to be compared to the criticism of the Kavanaugh Democrats, who were criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the middle elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official report, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the order of these misleading claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and everyone in my staff."
Review by Johnny English hits again – underwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British island, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the country's new export potential become a dry, sarcastic self-satisfaction?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber look and the big eyes have been given permission to make browsers renewed again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic invention directed towards places where the cinematographers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the thumped secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-tip Mr. Bean and a proper claw of him who performed a single tone for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international luxury bus that left chaos in his dress-up, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television ads.
There are some good moments in this latest shot on the strain of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying a medieval suit, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite overwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now as more "serious" films like 007 and Mission Nei also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film films in the role as Mr. Bean.
The never-ending point of view of the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-level spy network and revealed the identities of all English agents in the field of intimidation for the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work on in the manuscript.
Since her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been discovered, she is obliged to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, it's Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who secretly teaches in how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English is for some kind of school of rock education in spying.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard-tested previous right hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-enthusiastic but well-being subjugator – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the royal intelligence service is back to the very omega Batman and Robin, as they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister is snooping about moving away from the charismatic and disturbing tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their angry risk-filled excavators: Dressed as servants they put fire to a former French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Voltas luxury yacht; and English creates pure rognarok, as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make himself known to Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the film's final sequence, but how well-being and energyful it is, there is a sense of children's television over it.
Right medium.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking about the other Johnny English movies: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to barter on four-day workweeks with unchanged wages for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan, so that the English can be satisfied with a four-day work week, but pay for five.
The Party will allegedly have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra Friday.
This would mean that the employees would have three days a week without getting paid.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objective of attracting the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to profit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits with the Party's access to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the Party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the parliamentary election campaign in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported by unanimity in the Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting recording his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to withdraw the power from "anonymous directors" and "exploitors" in supply companies.
The Minister of Finance's plans also raise doubts as to whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the top could "mother" them in the light of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to have employees in corporate administrations and to set up including ownership funds, which are to allocate 10 per cent of the equity of private companies to employees who are expected to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up something that could lead them to change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this – after the accusations came up – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steeled, determined and unique."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to have been enameled in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and something else would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it at the most," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it's going to change anything."
What is the Festival of Global Citizens, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosted the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park's great Plain, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal that is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international organization of interest that is struggling to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert participants must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a telephone call or other meaningful action that can create awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they are 12 years old to reach the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicctivism" – that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter collection?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members towards different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding targets and policy measures, which amount to more than $37 billion, which in 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a cooperation between investors and business-intensive people. They strive to "help children to experience their full potential" and promise $35 million to solve nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has now promised to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
As an answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, which reads: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will screw up and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the performers at this year's New York Festival. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be host.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says the US Minister of the Interior
"If necessary", Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, reveals US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular where they operate at the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they will sell energy, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has with our fleet the possibility to ensure that there is free passage on the waterways, and if necessary, we can also block them, so we can ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting such as Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization that considers itself "the voice of the American energy consumer" – held.
He compared Washington's approach to handling Russia and Iran, and he said that they are all the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These opinions are based on the purpose of the Trump administration to increase the European export of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, speakers of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has made Berlin to Moscow "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kreml believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unfair conditions of competition and is simply because of economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing a supplier," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to merge outside the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party mixing in our energy supplies," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential election in 2020," says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential election after the mid-term election, she said on Saturday.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering stopping.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think strongly about putting up with the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump during the city council and said he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been expressed in his criticism of Trump and his high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
On a second Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI will examine the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday opinion shows that the majority of Warren's own country does not believe that she will have to settle in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% and 48% against a possible approach.
Other highly-profiled democratic candidates discussed during the presidential election in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The petition states that he will announce his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after reporting to the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son's going through after he came home makes me relate to other families that notice the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and wonder if there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was called for domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the report of domestic violence and to possess a weapon in a state of abuse, says Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the police in Wasillas.
18 countries and D.C. support resistance to new asylums
18 states and District of Colombia support a legal objection to a new American law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. made a party-dependent statement in Washington on Friday to support an applicant for asylum who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union introduced in August against the Federal Law, has not been published.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are band members" had abused her, but US officials refused her asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originate, as countries with widespread problems with domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum grant came under a decision taken by the US foreign policy exercise in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia's state attorney, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new law "is ignored by decades of government, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to the principle," says the party-dependent statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on non-immigrants is damaging the American economy, since they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide the necessary labour force."
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Session's immigration judges withdrew the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standing," the session said in its announcement of the law of 11 June.
It has never been meant that asylum should solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu despair
For survivors, the situation was only worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little feverish boy at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in body.
We don't need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined home to sort in bloody properties and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and hospitals that were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outside because of severe excruciating symptoms.
He had tears in his eyes when he told me how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth room, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got masturbated against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was going to marry in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of unrestricted methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper, a four-page ad in an American newspaper that hit drums for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador to China Beijing accuses him of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to China Daily's paid entry into the Des Moines Register – Iowa's best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of mixing in the November 6th Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked up in a escalating trade war, where they have in several ways imposed duties on each other's imports.
China’s trade-offs were to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s republican party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China, former Governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a director of the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "stops the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, there will be only a few disagreements, and you will not get a judgmental picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China's worrying economic direction, since the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, even though he did not say which.
Republicans broadcast women prior to the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
In many of the top republicans support and defend the high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a modern reaction in the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the cook, and most Republicans have already published that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done," said Grant Reher, professor of state science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation for 11 hours will soften the anger of voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to The Hill this Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators called: "November comes!", when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, it is said by Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say that it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not being able to like the president."
Even prior to Ford's public allegations of the high-level sexual abuse, analysts had pointed out that if the Republicans continued to hold the nomination, it could be delayed.
"It has become worse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final outcome, or about Kavanaugh being held responsible; it's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," points Guy Cecil, president of the United States of America, a group that supports Democrats in their election, to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who they should believe in after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new opinion from YeGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh in a completely secure or probable way.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following an invitation from Flake, the FBI now investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another one, Deborah Ramirez writes for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that Kavanaugh was fully opposed to her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the high-ranking nominee showed her her sex to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legacy project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-to-one lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique in the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company's managing director, John Bruce, to collect resources, processes and abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the tools available on the Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they're going to change everything completely, so all their business models suddenly get overloaded."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a collection on Medium in Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet that is built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net-neutral debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Water: Spiritual recipient of the Victorian Cross from the 1st World War
The only priest of the English Church who won the Victorian Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his home town 100 years after.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wan won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, at least one of his two children was discovered at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his children, said it was "incredibly symbolic", that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's ordering business.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant General Watern of 29 September 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick train and under fierce protection from masking and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and looked with the "greatest manhood" of his people before he alone attacked an artillered and undamaged three cannons.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also placed a crown after the parade, which was reported by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very impressed with participating in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underlines the true heroism."
MMA fan went up all night to see Bellator 206, but got replaced by Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the starlighted Bellator 206 and then you'll be denied seeing the main event.
There were 13 matches on the San Jose program, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the viewers in England were surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had been awake until early morning for just this fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a childish movie as "a sort of sick joke."
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said that they would work to include English viewers in the planning in the future.
"When you think about the broadcast, I think we can make it work," Coker said.
"But the hour is six Sundays tomorrow over there, and we don't find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We just had five fights instead of six, which we normally do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an accident."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minor value" over sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley says that he felt less worth than anyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't go up for him before he came into the major classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also said that he was less likely to win OL after becoming a parent.
The usual place on the long-run radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of the disease.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his upbringing, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "From now on, the feelings of being remembered and feeling differently have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a criminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The three-fold world champion said he had been "surprising", when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years older than him, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it's hard to find anyone at the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much in such a young age – he went to his first OL as a 14-year-old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had got tickets to London in 2012 – when he would be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there until that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to appear in front of a public at OL. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song – Proud by Heather Small – which had been very important during the recording of OL and still gave him gaise.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unskarp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it's not to be a sad millennium.
Mickelson, who continues to record for 12 times in the competition, which ends every 2 years, was placed on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk because of the four-balls and the foursomes.
Instead of being in the heart of the events of the United States as usual, the five - and - a - half - winner had to work hard and exercise in the hope of repairing the molds.
Even not at the top of his career he had the most just drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the track at Le Golf National, where the long rough often penalizes savages shooting.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet at the ninth match on Sunday, the ever-exact winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has fought with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 single fights, start strong, Mickeyson's fight can be crucial.
Furik did not express surprise confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a kick on my back, laid his arm on me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I guess I didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it was supposed to be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record beats most of the games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely been able to measure up to his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven undecided, even though Fury said his presence contributes to something inexhaustible.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, funny, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes with much more than just the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe, knowing that great lead can quickly disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cups' single-sealing can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just getting ahead of the goal with a victory of 1411⁄2-131.2.
"One keeps remembering that we had a nice drive in Valderrama, we had a nice drive in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just got the water," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total drive of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's supposed to be full of trash tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Enjoying the performances of his players on a hard track added Bjørn: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that count, and it's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what players have to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he will also get the best of himself."
Otherwise it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced covengings on the last day. First on the wind team in Brooklyn, before he lost, when Europe made "Miraklet at Medina".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brooklyn, as you saw at Medina.
When the moment has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle fighting.
We combine our team against it and put the players on the track in the order we feel. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the retreat and face Rory McIlroy in the top fight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warships are being launched again
The German fleet's latest cargo would have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war. However, the Germans must wait at least one year because of technical problems and an escalating price, local media writes.
The introduction of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is postponed until the first half of 2019 according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a speaker from the military.
The ship would have become part of the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have damaged the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
If they are known to have a powerful cannon, a large range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies, as well as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest freighters is a smaller need for maintenance: it would be possible to have the freighters away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which, in turn, will make Germany appear to be an oversea power factor – will already be obsolete when they are put in place, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125 team created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the ship returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of critical "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software error was of particular importance when the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be guided by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half of that crew of the older Bremen freighters.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's ability to update in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes the training of the team, is also by becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached €3.1 billion (€3.6 billion), with an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest freighters are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running dry for lighter ships."
The officer said that the problem had grown over time because the old ships were used without being replaced.
He complained that none of the cargoes from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flag Mouse
New research from an area in the Scottish Highland is trying to reveal how flag mouses use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is carried out by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows common bats, bats, long bats and bats at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed in precisely selected locations in the area to record the activities of bats during the season.
Staff data from NTS and volunteers are also collected using hand-held detectors.
In-depth analysis of audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show what kind of action they are doing.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Nature conservation advisors for NTS Rob Dewar hope that the results reveal what areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of eels and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can be the case for flue fields, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
Flagermus is not actually blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more usable than their eyes.
They use an advanced eco-location technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flag mouse very seriously.
They have 10 trained experts who often collect data, inspect wires and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated flag museum reserve in the area around Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s flag museums.
This area's keeper, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
There's a lot you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to do."
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single line can kill up to 400 females and young people, thereby risking extermination of a whole local population.
The flag mouse is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, harm or disturb them or their joints.
Elisabeth Ferrell, who is the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bat, and too many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects charges of violence, while lawyers seek German journals
Cristiano Ronaldo has called violent charges against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims to have paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations they have called "an inadvertent disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class corresponding to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly held in June 2009 at a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he had to rape her anonymously according to the report submitted in the town of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" grabbed by "one percent".
The files claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at a hospital, but that she later joined an agreement outside the court because she felt "feared for retribution" and worried about being "publicly insulted".
The 34-year-old now says she will oppose the agreement as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event would have taken place, and changed to the Italian Grand Club Juventus for €100 million in summer.
Brexit: Britain "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever", if it lost its status as world leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious", that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Toyotas Auris and Avensis factory produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain smokes out of the EU at the end of March," said the managing director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are afraid to leave the EU without a border trade agreement.
For example, BMW says they'll close their mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of an out-of-contract withdrawal.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there could be problems at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then the production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa Mays Chequers' plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statements by Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we must be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come again."
A speaker for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can "be delayed for a week more", as determined by the Highness-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking at the defendant Robert Mueller during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's possible obstruction of the court's proceedings.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a scourge in Washington for months.
New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering carrying a microphone to engage in talks with Trump and the possibility of placing the president through paragraph 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the back said he wanted to quit.
Instead, we agreed on a Thursday meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "do not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked to meet with Rosenstein, she said, "There's not a date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed one week with all that's going on in the high school.
But we have to see, and I like always keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not because of TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president takes more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source: "We've seen the figures."
Press meetings will still take place," Sanders said, but "if the press is able to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to make it possible, and you have seen us do it over the last couple of weeks, and it will be in the press room when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often raises questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health Contacts EU staff in Scottish Health by Brexit Concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express its gratitude and desire for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer the negotiations between Britain and the EU on accession continue, and decisions appear to be expected for the autumn.
But the British government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the effort each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and expertise, which strengthens and improves the work of health professionals for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christian Abercrombie gets acute surgery after major damage
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having had a slight major damage to the 31-27 downfall of the Saturday to Vanderbilt Commodores, it obeys from Tennessee Mike Organ.
First coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the side line and just fell out there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie air on the side line before they put him on a bar and took him into further investigation.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when it affected the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for two years and is starting with her first season in Tennessee State after a change from Illinois.
He had five gifts on Saturday before he left the match, which gives him 18 gifts collected this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp fee when they buy a property in the United Kingdom.
This move must dampen Corby's success by attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to deliver £120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when buying properties in the United Kingdom for the benefit of the homeless.
The stretch will be considered an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with promises of cheaper dwellings and following them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp fee will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The extra charge imposed above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases for rent may reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, which makes prices increase and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot within the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "species cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill will only come weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp fee to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies to keep the property prices up by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap homes to solve the "funny housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching series of housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the reduction of the lessee's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the capacity to build public housing.
May said, "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life would be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functional housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the United Kingdom to buy dwellings as hard-working Britain.
For too many people the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the vanity of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach.
The 42nd Scotland enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East Club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after searching for St. Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a fight with the B team, and that's what it was," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland at the Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and it's always dragged me.
However, it would only occur if I succeed in training clubs."
Ross' former coach for Sunderland is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says he had no thoughts about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success if 'I can get this club back to Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly home to Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll just see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in his career as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after having been pulled down in the third best row and transformed St. Mirren from the drinking pot to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels better now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real divorce," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that training was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I managed it well, made sense, and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still the kind of stress and pressure that coaches, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to practice, and now I'm doing it. I haven't been more comfortable with myself in my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., shows the study
The heat wave this summer has increased the profit for the British pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sale of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while the sale of restaurants has fallen 4.8%, shows figures.
Peter Martin, who is a company consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continually, sunscreen and England's unexpected long VM have meant that July follows June's pattern, where the public experienced excess sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants have been hit harder now.
The fall of 1.8% in restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubbers and bars with focus on the sale of beverages clearly managed the best and experienced progress corresponding to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Over pubic and barbic chains, sales of beverages increased by 6,6 % per month, while food dropped by 3,3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service sector, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sporting events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will cause real pain above rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a hard-pressed mood."
The total increase in sales combined for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2,7 % in July, showing the fall in newly started fires.

Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide for their parents
Every fifth child, down to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows research.
A study of 20,000 school students in 4-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added
20% of students said they have a "head account", which they can show their parents
Every fifth child down to 11 years of age creates social media accounts that they hide for adults.
A study of 20,000 4th class students reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo distribution service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being raised.
20% of students said they have a "head account", which they can show their parents, while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, then a teenager who urged others to "violently rape me".
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to have private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilid enjoys great esteem in the athletic world in Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help set a course for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four OL gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre races at OL in Atlanta in 1996, and who is now often a commentator to BBC, could not follow a transitional ischemic attack.

I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I would get up there and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm pretty fast, I've learned to go back and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertising that compares nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first soundless breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement that will show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a costume filled with hay to a song in which it says: "Yes, I paint myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's not this much more, it's my breasts."
The scarf says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I paint my bar."
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "fears" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they should be pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.

Another wrote: "I understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still accommodating, I'd have had one.
Amning made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertising directed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'sweet'.
It is not an advertising that praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women discover that they've danced with the discreet pumps in their bobs.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who are adamant say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely deaf, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in an amme-bh, which gives women freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, who is a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while showing in a entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can give."
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tents at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border crossings has not changed.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they are afraid of being able to stay in the country by standing up and taking a child.
The risk of home transmission rose in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the Congress and told the Congress that they had arrested several persons who were seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The management subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had purely criminal certificates.
"Approximately 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' households are illegally staying in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people," said Albence.
In an attempt to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of meeting themselves and talking about their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are sentenced to invalidity shall be deported quickly.
The longer the children get into custody, the more likely they are to get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcome or attempted flight, the more workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger installations such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on the suffering of a child.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the possibility of saying goodbye to friends can bring up traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" that they must withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now at its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under threat of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with equivalent funds."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily coaching Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unjustified fear", which made the refugees go away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these home broadcasts," he said.
"They are policing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that aid will not be provided to rebuild the country before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled town of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
On the basis of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a large attack from the Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would follow jihadists from the Nusra Front, a group of Al-Qaeda, who would "be eliminated".
The United Nations mission Staffan de Mistura hopes to call on the new committee's first meeting to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for a elections.
Moualem has laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the legislation of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the Kingdom case and the scandals end his presidential term in advance, which many liberal spectators hope for.
In what certainly becomes "the most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
At present, there is no sign of injury.
Since 2014, the watch counts for the best transmission time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million at night with big news.
"It's a show that people are attracted to, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC Drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a tax trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Cause he makes me laugh," said Scovell.
The chaos has value of entertainment.
However, unlike all other TV programs, the stories from Washington can decide whether Roe and Wade will be able to restore the health of refugee families and the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet it is more than being informed citizens when you see a six-hour panel debate where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's straw-head jacket for $15,000 ("dressed with hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's living descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
Anyway, I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and day-to-day surprises (knocking with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're fired.
When I got caught in Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and to decide the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before the time, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums will lead to the close mid-term choice of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two Congressional Districts, two congressional members fight for the same seat.
This recently surrounded urban district in Pittsburgh creates problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb sets up against another member of the Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17.
The cards were remanded, after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January judged that the old district had been legally placed in favour of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a struggle for financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Campaign of Democrats Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly vigilant election in March's special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small benefit.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump's management team.
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts of economic aid and restrictions on access permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials launched a summit conference on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was supposed to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
In mid-September, however, topembed people made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus dropped the thought of punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal on the importance that the Americans attach to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on a condition of anonymity.
Unknown history
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible impediment to the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
After all, Mueller will also investigate the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If the Congress were to come to new hands, Trump would likely be held responsible while he was preparing to meet again the electors and, of course, in time a jury of his companions.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump is inevitably inevitable – and the same is true of his opponents in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put in a coup against Hitler, if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the long - term bloodbath afterwards.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the inevitable march of democracy is going to go down or down.
In the United States, there are now several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump drives the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot, since this newspaper was able to announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly carried out – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And what is more important is that we vote in the middle of the election for a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime itself, who once possessed my ambassador's country.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away 60 years later to light the Sabbath light on the table with the garden cross.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, they will have good opportunities to move from Group G of the Europa League with a victory against the Austrians.
A broken midway player Graham Dorrans prevented getting a season debut before the 2-2 fight against Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but everything was quite a result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope to get three points, but it will be hard because they got a good result in the last match. But with the audience behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but the vote is good now.
The hold is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Fear of retirement makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the study in the United Nations told us that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have savings.
Get the legal documents in order: Take the legal battles in the process.
Get a warrant so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses respect your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic force.
In that case, you shall designate a trusted person who can make economic decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents is in urgent need of medical help and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who's matching the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air raid on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in the '40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, middle floor and hand.
The officer describes the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as "all by chance."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His damage is not life threatening, and the police call for witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency personnel have not been able to receive information from Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesian province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongalla is a regent that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the central Sulawes economy, particularly in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel wind is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have reportedly been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996, Dongala was again hit by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismologically located in the so-called Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean Coast, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and only in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake, measuring 6.8, hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatran province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake hit Pide Jaya's estate in Aceh and spread destruction and panic as the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok of Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin's oldest son targeted for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor in Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, prevention of reporting domestic violence and to resist arrest, according to the report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is jailed in Mat-Su Pretral Facility with a guarantee of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "very innocent", reports the network.
Palin is targeted for three Class A violations that can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a Class B violation that can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been targeted for violations of law.
In December 2017 he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being handled by Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, which prevented the notification of a violent crime in the home and possession of arms in the affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of having given her a blow in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after explaining her son’s violent behaviour with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people have died, after an earthquake Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media there are videos that show the moment where the earthquake strikes.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get a terrorist suspect in NYC in rare death sentences
Public prosecutors are trying to get a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorist attacks in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare penalty that was finally sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came on the road were allowed down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intent for the death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these purposes.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov for an appeal with 22 points, including eight charges of murder in connection with gang gang activity, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "wide-ranging planning and preparations", the prosecutors said and described Saipov's execution as "disgusting, wicked and debased."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," the statement of intent says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's South District last traveled in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder on two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was later passed in a state case in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were married after being sentenced to espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no indication of the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was good at his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to make the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up in his hospital room, told the officers.
He has denied himself guilty in 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "of course were disappointed" about the accused's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the accused not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians could "mark the press" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The many conservative MP Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "be out now" if Farage had been Brexit's negotiator.
May’s challenge to create a collection in the deeply fragmented party is emphasized by the participation of conservative remnants in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on the track during attacks by both Brexitiers, Remainors and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the backlog, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "caustics".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would destroy the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added, "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to have to scrape the Chequers."
On the basis of his EU opposition, he said: "We did not fight World Wars to be someone's subordinate.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone refused that the public's position should have changed since the vote in 2016: "If the British people had changed their minds and wanted to remain in the EU is totally wrong."
The conservative Brexitee Andrea Jenkins was also for the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Drop the Chequers now, and start listening."
As a tip to May, she added: "The Prime Minister keeps their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the record that politicians should be able to "mark the press" if they failed the decision from the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're together to tell them that we won't let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class who is on the verge of betraying Brexit can mark the press.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-government and proud Great Britain."
During the last march through Birmingham before a totimer took place in the city center.
Scattered activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made a joke about the security problems with the conservative party app before the meeting.
"It is the people who claim to have control of the IT systems and technology of Canada, border controls, free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's all for fun.
There is nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to stand up to the presidential election" after the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city council meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
In November, Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try to re-election the state’s Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been speculated whether she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the electors at the councilhouse, since Trump took over the office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to stand up to the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front."
Detention in the case of gunpowder at LSU's Sims
The Baton Rouge police reported on Saturday that on Friday a suspect was arrested for shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help in identifying a man on the footage.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by gunshots in his head and killed by the damage," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to media 247 sports.
Wayde took action to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was arrested and admitted to having been present in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody of the East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two-metre high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 matches, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world championship, after team commanders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified himself in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the driver position, Bottas got a good start and was close to hanging Hamilton completely off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first one, and let Hamilton fight the traffic rearmost in the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into the pit a little later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, when the Ferrari driver had to leave after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstoppen started from the rear row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the race when in an attempt at a quick conclusion he failed to change the deck to take Kimi Raikkon’s fourth seat.
He had to go to the pit on the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the last eight rounds, so the Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a hard day because Valteri did it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The Holdet did an incredible piece of work to ensure both the first and the second places," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump accused Senator Dianne Feinstein at a poll this Saturday because she insisted that she had not finished the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the high-ranking board of Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Legal Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "disgusting and rebellious and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and angry and rebellious and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at opinions and play, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who made it look bad?
Remember her answer... was you the one who leaked the document – "Oh, oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I haven't licked anything."
Hey, hold on a second.
Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, and I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during the Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been charged with the sexual assault of three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the charges to benefit their own case.
"They don't spare any money in their efforts to regain power.
You can see the wickedness, the resistance, they don't care who they need to fool to get power and control," the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday's lost Elite League fight against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return campaign in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants came forward quickly with two targets attacked by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were on their way home before Dwyer brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of Adam Keefe's team that came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in the Friday battle in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides where Giants went out as conquerors in the three previous battles.
Dwyer posted for the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant when Beauvillier doubled the drive four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan returned home to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownies' compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giants got ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard re-balanced with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen to lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Aeroplanes died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escaped earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is completely honored after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers arrived safely on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake in the island of Sulawesi on Friday, and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still raging, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agungs fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the floating control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He went back to his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway, was safe in the air.
He jumped out of the tower because he thought it was about to get together.
He died at the hospital later.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said according to the Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added, "We're Santa Claus."
The authorities fear that the death toll may reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores have been stolen."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the day to carry out all the duties of evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquake in Lombrok earlier in the year when more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane Management in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane management in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the descending plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for further information on the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Locals were both helping to save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people were in the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were in the hospital for Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the American Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing route.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the landing.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into the water to get to the emergency exits of the descending plane.
He said the crew panicked and cried and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working on renovating a cage nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people in the country before the plane sank at about 30 metres.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts set a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidence on Saturday during the application of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as an expert in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to sum up the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness hospital on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at one point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is a political hippop?
A hippoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hippop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hippop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a revital in Britain due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Child girl in New York sues couple after shooting with "racist" text
A child girl in New York sues a couple for discriminatory shooting after having received a text message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
Parrett denied that they were racist, but compared the case with "pressurisation".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, who is the mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"No, not even a sort of person," wrote Plasco-Faxman to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, she fired the "unsatisfied" Plasco-Faxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former child girls, who were from African-American, had been bad for their work, and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home to a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the fired and compensation of $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she said to the paper Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racist and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone for whom you had been unworthy, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby?
It's very honest."
Plasco compared the case to "pression", and that his wife had been born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really looking for someone like that?
It is not specifically done," added the Investment Adviser.
Although the trial is still under way, the People's Court has already written down the couple on social media and shamed their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted to publication, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's quite fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington has been."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small wardrobe, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year of publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't break to cry," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, though it is not your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity in that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors lost tried to save her life.
"Nade called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"So I received a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart in motion slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now she closed the body down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperous went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Poor women try to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost touch with suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known to everyone.
People said that his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he really had it wrong.
In 2014, it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him when he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' multi-year friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sorry for it or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, he started to change.
He was really long down Christmas, and when the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight together."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear, while the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked – a time-limited study with limited scope – we could perhaps have a little agreement," Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "falled from the obstacle" in the middle of the trapped party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republicans not support the FBI's investigation?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to choose as the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and then met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean decouplers 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean settlers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Association Ministry and said that there were 1,127 runners last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smuggling were contributing to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not provided any official comments.
In time, most of North Korean immigrants are granted citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border crossing to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the refugees to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met to discuss the bilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho gave US sanctions due to the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will weaken on our own," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate for the high court.
The President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is appointed to the Supreme Court, for "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, she would have been called hysterically," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the charges that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him "great and coordinated character courage" arranged by the left wing, which was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the president's post in 2016.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the high court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the opinions and the way he followed Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi road outside when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a kingdom if he was confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he does not speak truthfully against Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly also in the court he is sitting at present," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or abortion Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would circumvent certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, prejudiced person will have to fight a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just beautiful'," Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It is a fair outcome, a number of months and years of anger, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I received great support from a woman who was head who said that she also wept when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would say to the one she talked to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just knew.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood in the bottom and bottom.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a weight of men, where I often cry of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss I had always been a little scared of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You should never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was discovered to have an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could just as well stand up as president.
"It wasn't a particularly thoughtful decision," she said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She found out that some of her support that gave $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she said that she would not settle, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to raise money and get out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her neck.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleinex.
I remember thinking what you're going to write on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
Thus the US-China trade war can be an advantage for Beijing
The openings in the US-China trade war were loud, and even though the battle was far from over, the gap between countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning notice earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest scale this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion is in principle half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has paid back every time, at the latest by charging customs duties of 5-10% on American goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the next largest economy in the world is probably not providing immediately.
If it makes Washington withdraw his demands, it means they're giving up, but for China's President, Xi Jinping will be too boring to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a foundation for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security thought tank.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says that the country is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since 2011, where the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to help rebuild the hardy country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe guarantees Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to hit the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on a couple of 3 on a 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was broadcast with 5&4 of the lowest ranking European players, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 of the World rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
This is a stand-by effort and I am glad that I can help," said a sentimental Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the falcon back to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golfing Tiger Woods 2+1 on a singlematch Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud of having beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup-historic 13-21-3.
It is a spy's statistics for one of the best golfers ever who have won 14 great titles, just passed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a whole weekend problem finding the form except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing demonstration: "I'm proud of the guys, for they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe back.
We lost.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we'll move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You've got to take a look at the hat.
We were defeated."
Update on algeflowering: The concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general lowering algal concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, widespread flowering is reported in the areas around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – which indicates that the concentration is falling.
The flowering of algae spreads over a coastline of 210 km from the northern Pinellas County to the southern Lee County.
