Members of the Wallese Assembly are worried they're going 'like sotes'
There is confusion among some members of the meeting on the proposal that their title be changed from AM to MWP (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Walloon Parliament.
Members of the political spectrum are afraid that it may trigger a ridicule.
One member of the Workers Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhyme."
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallies twp means stupidity and pwp means relaxation.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternative.
A member of the Wallese Conservative Party says his group is "acceptable" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech passage from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of sot or stupid.
In this context, the Wallian letter you like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter is spoken to you.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Wallis Rule Act 2017 gave the Wallis Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that have received broad support to call the meeting a Wallian Parliament.
As regards the title of the AM, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs were elected by the Commission, but the MWP option received most approval in consultation with the public.
The AM is apparently proposing alternatives, but the fight to gain consensus can be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who must propose a bill of change within weeks.
The law on reforms will also include other changes to the way in which the meeting is to work, including rules on the disqualification of the AMs and the draft committee system.
The AM will find the last statement in the question of what they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Elections will vote Sunday whether their country's name should change to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to eliminate a decade-long dispute with Greece, which itself had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been demanding for a long time that the name of his neighbor in the north represent a claim in his area and has repeatedly made a cap on his applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia’s president, George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's get quiet because churches in Harlem are in trouble.
"Historicly spoken," said the old people I spoke to, "there was a crow and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is there today."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People socialize today in other ways," he says.
"Kroe is no longer the neighborhood's family rooms where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, the money from battalion sales is not going to last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartments with condominiums full of people who will not help the neighbor’s remaining refugees.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why the day will bring these churches all the way, because most of the people who will enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation withdrew in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the direction of Earw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of small traders in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Erew. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the cartoon "the poor people's clocks."
The expert who played the charilion in July said something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the largest carilion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in the past few months at St. Martin's is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal bishop.
The church council, the congregation’s governing body, which consists of laymen, wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop "try to transfer the costs" to the church council, although the council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bishop.
Some congregation members complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Hai injured 13-year-olds on cavities in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on the first day of the shark season in California for sharks, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then pulled a group closer to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first catch, but then he realized 'that he called,' I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole key leg was cut open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I called out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flying to the Council Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known which major species are responsible for the attack.
Life rescue chief Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark was spotted a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim caused traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sciencebury's plan to expand to UK beauty market
Sciencebury's says Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty walks that are manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods return, the larger beauty passes will be tested across the country in 11 shops and if this is a success the following year will be taken to more shops.
The investment takes place in beauty while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill racks once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sciencebury's say it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include for the first time trades such as Revlon, Essie, Tweizerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with trademark-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs its Boutique Grimming Series so that the majority of products are veghan-friendly - something that increasingly younger buyers are changing.
In addition, the perfume dealer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the last of which opened in Croydon in South London and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket is trying to fight back with more services and non-foods against Aldi and Lidl discount shops.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains back two years, which, according to their herbal sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint company with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended with an argument about how the profits from the pharmacy should be distributed within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a part in the plan by offering a wide range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sense of our beauty processes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also promised in special-trained colleagues who will be handy to provide advice.
Our range of business names are designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now a territorial beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraging' after Holly Willoughby withdrew to £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 'enraging' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her to a £11 million match with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their dress-up and casualty trade name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trading name.
This morning's offerer, 37, announced on Instagram that she had withdrawn her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones angry at the last moment by withdrawing their lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source says Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a busy meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities -- worth £1.5 million -- meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their dress-up and accessibility trade name, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trading name and would, according to Willoughby, double the estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she had left True, Jones climbed on a beam and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority far away.
It would be her long - term future that would bear her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw from her was absolutely stupid.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the announcement.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this morning provider, one of Britain’s stars that makes most money flow, the firm can hunt millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household clothes, and the possibility that its announcement may be even more slow.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been near Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up True in 2016 with Capp and joined Jones, 52, as president in March.
The couples have a vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A well near Jones last night said, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He laughed at criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would view as "unprecious" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his chamber- "new-reading voice."
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a major step after the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons have been fuelled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June leader's meeting in Singapore, leaders at the UN General Assembly said that the North did not see a "conforming reaction" of the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions designed to keep the pressure running.
Trump took a much more optimistic stand in his convention talk.
"Our progress is excellent with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim produced positive results — ending firearm tests, helping free hostages, and causing the rest of American soldiers to return home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have almost 200 people standing just there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Gulf and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds died
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign kidney organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been declared, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which made it a bit difficult," I said.
Although Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assisting the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country is sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not a general face to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning sirens in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a powerful warning.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at its best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's frenzied infrastructure a core point of his election campaign, and has been making generous money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Yoko’s administration is being run by fund cuts as he looks back into the face the following year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing the pressure of overwhelming sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of outcasts, such as Christian and Muslim gangs, fought with spears and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge saw a good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He pointed the ball to the left before digging far into the target.
The effort went high above the frame as it swam to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball came across a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in just the case.
"It was just to try to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play ahead as far as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and type one time and don't think too much about it and just spit."
Chelsea was 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper again played in that playroom with a backdrop to Mateo Kovacic before he landed near the middle field and crept into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up with a left-footed head past Liverpool's Alice Becker in the last target.
Liverpool conducts the battle against Naples at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday, about 3 p.m.
Chelsea came to London on Thursday for 3 nm in the UEFA Europa League before Videoton.
Further rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunamis
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the rumbling of buildings that caused the earthquake, which hit Friday at 7.5, and caused firemen from up to 20 feet, the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was embellished with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, suspected of murder after the death of a woman
A murder investigation was sent from a pile after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knives, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area who had heard or seen anything.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is at an early stage but I am calling on anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that can be indispensable to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman at the scene came up to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued as the police said they were in the process of illustrating the victim’s neighboring possessions.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take hours before they are reinitiated.
It has been heard that a police officer tells one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, ‘ It’s so rude. ’
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials have been placed in the cordon to monitor the block accommodation.
Anyone with information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or to link Crimestoppers anonymously to 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's status of Cromwell is becoming the newest memory hit with a 'rewrite of history' dispute
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "society" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The imagery of the English Civil Wars was either ordered by Cromwell or executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s mundane depiction of Cromwell was evidence of the 19th century’s opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is being seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, of course in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is a fairly accurate presentation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is determined is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure that represents one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Chinese Traditional Boer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his wife, "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-off blood-covered bat near a hook at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs from a pig farm in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports on Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighbor's pighouse.
He said there was a big male pig in the corner with blood on his back.
A forensic investigation has confirmed, according to the report, that the 550-pound pig has killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and torn," said the cousin, who was called 'Wu', quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 pm to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Event New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the branding authorities negotiate claims compensation for his death.
Although odd, cases of pigs that have been attacked have been reported previously.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their behalf in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 - pound - cow tied a Wallian farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playful.
They're picky, very curious... they're not about to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Orkaan Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest U.S.
As foretold, as it moves on the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico, Hurricane Rosa is weakened.
Rosa, however, will bring floods across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
On Sunday, from 5 pm east time, Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a category 1-orcaan, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa Sunday is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a struggle over the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west of the United States. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity north-west.
Rosa will bring Monday rains of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
On the other hand, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous torrents, wastes, and perhaps landfills in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause local rainfall rates from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Flying floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unwise to put the wilderness in jeopardy by the danger of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause deep - rock desert rivers to fall and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trolley will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low rainfall and smooth fish.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will leave Arizona on Sunday and early Monday before the rain makes Monday and Tuesday more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the troops remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States is Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, many summer heat will try to increase and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to start warm October, with extensive 80s from the Southern Low Plain to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance at average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the overwhelming testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-nipper-turn: an agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate-Justice Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to get her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heart - to - heart testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And at times, Nielsen finds it difficult to measure people in offices.
To put it into perspective, it's a hearing as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose spokesperson Kavanaugh strongly supported the appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderated Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested Friday morning at CNN and CBS where protestors yelled at him when he tried to take a lift to a judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while CNN was alive picturing how he was being beaten.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and went in front of the elevator door, said he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and excavator networks all covered hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do it only with the idea that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat minority requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators after, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political games' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political gambling" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative We Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should promote each other's tariffs was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dytheon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the riot.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-related WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he had killed Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The courtroom of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's continuing task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanks for law enforcement for his "jerk and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average season last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 reversings per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball chief Will Wade said the team "slap" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about," said Wayde.
Volcanic as on Mexico City
As the popocatepeti volcano boasted reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican Saturday to stay away from the volcano after taking action in the crater and registering gas and ash releases over 24 hours 183.
The center has a wide range of vibrations and vibrations.
Pictures on social media showed how thin low - gas wind screens near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, were covered.
Geophysics marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence voices
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting pro-independence activists, and thousands joined in protests to commemorate the first memorial of Catalonia's polarizing vote for dismissal.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by unwelcome police, they smothered eggs and threw powder paints that caused dark clouds of dust in streets that usually flow from tourists.
A chair also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their buttons to keep the fight going.
In a few hours' time, pro-independence groups sang in a tone "Don't forget, don't forgive" in confrontation with the unionist's cry of "Lunk Live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries caused by the riots reported the local press.
The tension is still high in the independent mind a year after the October 1st referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against abstinence that had largely scored the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at the polling stations across the region from continuing.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent an exercise in support of the national police.
The ride continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist movement with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but fragile victory in district elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled this year to maintain a moment, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-contained exile or in detention in advance for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the move in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after engine against home vasry
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly trapped a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded at around 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A cruise boat may also have been shot at a stage in the car.
Menga target gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assures victory
Encouraging Livigston, Rangers were surprised to transfer Steven Gerard to his second defeat in 18 contests as a driver of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was to prove the difference when Gary Holt and Hibernian moved to second.
Gerrard's team stayed that season in the Prime Minister's office without a way out and came next week to stand before the predecessors of Heart, which is their eight points.
Rangers were first host to Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone expanded their rounds in the division to six matches, with Chief Officer Holt who still hasn't tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston plays odds against bot visitors
Holt's team had to run ahead long before they signed up for a purpose, with their round breast that Rangers got all kinds of problems on their neck.
SR broke through, but turned before the target, when ALL could play wide only after he got closer and met CH’s head across the target.
The host was pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead toys.
And so the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave up a puzzle and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to dig and to draw a goal from the middle of the window.
By that time, Rangers had dominated but could not get through the domestic defense, and the target Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a coup from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was kicked off by the feet of Rangers' target guard Allan McGregor and Littgow typed to avoid any more open game of Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached and turned over again and again, while two fines — after Halkett’s challenge by Deputy Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were removed.
Livingston’s Phenomenal – Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and outcomes for Livingston.
Until the last man was outstanding; they still surpass expectations on this upward course.
Their style of play and team have been almost unchanged since they returned to first grade, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge in his multiplicity defense order, while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall kept on holding on to their toes.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they could at times under Gerrard could not keep those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they push through the home team, which is somewhat of a call for Rangers, which they found in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was Saturday (September 29th) smiling and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an outcome on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan was then assigned to Keulen to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have quoted security reasons to prevent the 25 000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have then arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan fighters – many of their Kurds – also made their voices loud and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The combatants reflect the division of a visitor welcomed by some German Turks as heroes and declared by others as autocrat.
Deptford-Padon accident: Cycling dies in a collision with a motor
A bicycle driver died in a collision in London with a car.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the connection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another bike driver died in a hit-and-step at Children Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police reported that officials were working to identify the man and whitewash his neighbors.
Roadblocks and bus guides were replaced, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security prison, the prison said.
On Sunday, about 09:30 BST broke out and was still underway at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" was called upon to handle the rioter, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those who are responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind track."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called on to pay attention to serious accidents during which billiards were attacked.
Orkaan Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsflude (Drug Areas Dalk Advantage)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona, but it's just what can happen early next week when Orcaan Rosa's remaining energy moves over the southwest desert and brings cat flood risks.
The National Religious Service has already issued wakes for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa Tuesday will take a direct route over Phoenix, and by Monday it will bring rain.
The National Defence Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orcaan Centre models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of floods, Rosa’s rain is likely to be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall will likely be beneficial, since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drug Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s route leads to the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, always on a sunny Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north on 12 miles per hour.
The storm stops colder water in the Pacific, so its strength decreases.
So it is expected that its Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico will reach the country.
Rainfalls on parts of Mexico can be heavy and present a significant flood risk.
" Rainfall totals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north over Mexico before it Tuesday in the early morning the Arizona border as a tropical depression and then will move through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Orcaan Centre.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening floods and floods in the deserts and earthquakes in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he was still in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'Ley has under the community, the rage' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has fled under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed on Thursday before the Congress and enthusiastically and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her claim at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday the Americans saw "the brilliantness and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service," he told the crowds of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and impede."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leader coach told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shaking, tsunamis, with still rising numbers
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke down on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a festival on the beach when firemen from up to six feet (18 m) broke high against the sun on the beach, washed away many after their death, and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-fold earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, trunks, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster scene show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn and broken, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still rocked by nascokes.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant slaughter was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the point of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala which is close to the earthquake.
Communication "is completely more impeding with no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected area.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur imaging material shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building's desperate warnings about the coming tsunami screams to the people down the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and slurry buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately explain the image material.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power cuts that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuations still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit the Palu resorts on Sunday.
Indonesia's death rates are rising to over 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in Palu City where workers were hiding in shelters set up in their office’s courtyard, they went on their way to scenes of destruction, Mr. Dosebah said.
They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as relief teams begin their task of launching the disaster relief team, some have complained that foreign aid workers are being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks, and overseas personnel can be deployed only after the disaster area has been declared nationally.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can open it up for international assistance, but it hasn't yet a status."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunamis, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers saved a woman for two days under the rubble were stuck with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the director of the Indonesian national battalion team, has removed two of the missing battalion bats for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandadi, was his students.
"As a senior in the battlefield I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the batting weave community, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were answered only with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thief steals $26,750 during refill of OTM at Newport on the Livee
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Livee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car driver was emptying an OTM in a entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, stalker Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man came "from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspicions that fled from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name — to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The beings were formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for a long time been called Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new Yandhi all.
He replaced Ariana Grande with the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", the program’s manufacturer said.
In addition to the fact that it is abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with Radio Provider Big Boy.
"As I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye — just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known among other things as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has also come up with or without a sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in effect, promised the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the force to control the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements were posted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training drew the youth to gangs.
US should double KIC funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US has to double the amount spent on research in this field, the investor and KI-practice Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made KI announcements, even recently the U.S. is a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China announced their plan: to be the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Double the KIC research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in KIC," said Lee.
The duplication of funding can double the chances that the next major US KI performance will be achieved, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has been promised in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a KI system that hit the highest approved U.S. Othello player and later was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has recognised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the following visionary years.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government thrones, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate law," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work at AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to assist the US's KIC efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD's in KI," he said.
In July 2017, China’s Council of State issued their next Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at contacting friends from the business and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently accounts for more than $100 million a year in KI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been under fire for months.
Macedonians should vote in preference or change country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbouring country's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their consent to NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott had doubts as to whether the rise would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum note read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to seek permission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to determine it.
The name change will require a second parliamentary delegation.
The state’s election committee said there were no reports of malnourishedness by 1 nm.
However, the rise was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote for the Macedonia referendum on the change of country name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small increase and brought chairs closer to tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his voice.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote.
For the referendum to be successful, rise should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A coup d'état in the referendum will be the first serious coup d'état for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy at his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received an indication at the beginning of the series.
He chased between three Brighton defenders through before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green hems.
He pushed past one defender before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target.
He then pushed a finger to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the corner to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton-target guard Matthew Ryan with a spear to the right of the net.
"Aguero has trouble with his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that he signed up for a purpose at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area on that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some touch before he led Sterling to the nearest target.
The Sky Blues predictor just before he was over the back.

Shrezer wants to play dirty games against Rockies
With the Nationals who are out of the game, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to accept the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-implications for the Rockies, which has a one-off match over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a promo-choice spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still wants to determine their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me this year will look into the face.
Why would I not want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their first player for Sunday, but according to the report, it is favorable to let Scherser into such a situation.
Scherser, who will begin his 34th, had a throwing exercise Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 extracts in 220 2/3 in turn this season.
Trump holding conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance at the mid - term elections.
"All we've done is on the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "One sees this ugly, ugly radical group of Democrats, one sees it now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by any possible means; one sees the community, the folly.
They don't give to him who hurts them, whom they should walk to get power and authority. This is what they want, power and power. We won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand up and impede."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and had the Democrats called "swad and common and gnosy and false."
In the name, he referred to the Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diana Feinstein, who received hard sentences from the hearing.
"Remember her answer?
Do you want to reload the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting for one – it was really poor body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to put me under sensory, it was not just a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Workers Party LPs who were told we weren't welcome – all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironic enough similar issues that Jeremy has differed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting Friday said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the show of many meetings and the promise of "friendly, more favourable" politics has been forgotten for a long time if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began expecting me to make a U-turn and take up positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's a Titrate of Scary Language on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, rejection of politics from the core and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments I was directed to are political.
I have great respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexual or racist insults every day, but never fear away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers Party had to cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "museum of distrust" or change of electoral rules, some become more narrow.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so expressive, and that I will then be "okay."
But I did not go into politics to do so.
Since I joined the Workers Party 32 years ago, encouraged by thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my high school dropouts, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most — whether as a local council member or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the present leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending on a Brexit that is going to damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Workers Party.
But the only message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, or they are now members of the Workers' Party, though not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to be re-elected or political advantage will stop me from doing what I believe in your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose — An Uncircumcised Father
Two late threes may have pulled the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned to win in this wonderful-usual Tennant's Prime Minister's Day contest.
They are now at the top of the stage, the only unsurpassed team of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, who carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We have so far been tested in our fights and we are still unencumbered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson’s three in the 14th minute, invented by Frazier Climo, made Ayr appear, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the Warriors’ match, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unforgivable three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest a soloist aimed to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, shot through Baggot, reduced the retreat to five points.
There was a long recollection of a serious injury to Ruarid Knott that was carried down on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, pierced by Climo.
Ayr's observed Captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure.
The home team made a return, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed for Climo without the ball, and from the penal station MacPherson pushed the ball dead behind the coming Ayr-solvent.
Climo aimed it, as he also almost did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong got his target head and sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth team of three.
Still Game-star looks like he's going to take a new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star will move to the hospitality business after it has been discovered that it has been designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy nephew Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the program, and Kiernan seemed to be preparing for life in Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Aragingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun sought to involve Kiernan at Glasgow's "flowering restaurant company".
'The sea is ours': rural Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matros patrol a masculine fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a maritime flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are filled with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the surrounding Bolivia, the memories of the coastline they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile are still fresh — as is the need to reinvigorate the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest that it has been in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president – who next year faces a controversial struggle for reelection in the face – also has many that depend on Monday's verdict.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia will decide in favor of it — and that it would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body has no power to recognise Chilean territory, and has urged that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict is only six months away, shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down for the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was purchased by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale’s aggressive rhetoric gave way to any remaining Chilean kindness, she made known.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks at a time again, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct nearby talks.
In 1962, the two countries last exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end up 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the seafaring issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfil the promises made during a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the competing countries.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's apparently on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. captions to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on his knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without first taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second round.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about making a distance from an arsenal that considers the country the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Parisian fashion shows reveal newest series of big headlines on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely reject the sun, you do not need to search further.
Developers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a series of large-scale lava mains at their SS19 collection in the course of the course that fascinated the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Out of impractical care, this summer’s Instagram passed and these designers paraded their dazzling creations over the course of time.
The vanguard by Valentino was a large beige hat with a four-dimensional wide edge that engulfed the models' heads.
Other major occurrences included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a vocabulary hat and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also announced a series of cute masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had refined lips and looked more like Hannibal Lekter than a leather coat.
One creation looked like a shelling device, with a snorkel and thick glasses, while another looked like a melted rommy horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Stylish viewers predict that the huge guard may be on the way to the shops near you.
The oversized hat follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on all its heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractice cover spread over social media has sent another great creation over the course of the course -- a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the swathed model that wore it.
The burned orange raffiasac, finished with raffia frying and finished a white leather handle on the top, appeared at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known styler Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in shops next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize in the future.'
John Edward: Language skills needed for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a wealth of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which was only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community companies.
With over 30,000 schools throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted school curriculum, we see that world languages continue to be a popular and desirable profession in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, it will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages above the league tables are with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data collected from the 74 member schools of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same reputation as the STEM fields (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the U.K. Committee on Jobs and Vacancies found in 2014 that 17 percent of the reasons why employees struggle to fill jobs are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically place a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults in the United States in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation and France was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to teach the language in today’s children.
To know a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered necessary for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be recognized at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still of great importance to the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The watch is almost over for adherents to see how LeBron James made his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton announced that James in Sunday's upcoming opening game against the Denver Nuggets will play in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he's going to play, it still has to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell argued that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers ’ six matches in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season struggles at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight a flagship election conference in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled collections next week, including stops at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmatory vote now held for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming elections because the Republics are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
How late is Trump's collection in West Virginia tonight and how does one look online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 nm. ET this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see below by living streaming to Trump's collection in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess is to help the Republics facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five summaries were designed next week to "visit volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Management over Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy field season," a spokesperson for the Trumpfield, who refused to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's gathering, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, supporters can withdraw from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points, will visit.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the stamps.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a kick at the vocal bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Riderbecker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have the courage to keep the hope alive when entering Sunday’s single game
After three single sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Riderbecker needed.
The swinging hose of moment is a completely different sport concept but one in which players believe fully, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the moment is now?
"They've gone ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, and twelve more being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points from four.
Spyth was mortal from the top to the clear ground and led by his example.
That score of celebration got tougher as he progressed his rounds and he laid down a critical setthou to win the game four altogether while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
She sets up what won the match on 15 for them, is greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to get it all out and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That is all that those players now have.
18 drops to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points over the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Riderbecker.
Europe’s couples but a charming couple have obtained four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep one on Saturday afternoon on track, but they also kept one on Saturday morning on track as well as during the last nine Friday mornings.
That walk, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this vast crowd, confirms that they are the players to be hit Sunday, and there will be no favourite player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can tap a potential European victory when the sun falls on Le Golf National.
Select both at the same time and at different times.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short deals with Sergio Garcia, the four - star hero of the morning, when he played with Alex Noren.
One holds over track numbers and two doubles on the front nine, the Spaniard and the Swede put in a hole from which they could not even get close.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to keep close to watching because of the interaction between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change into an eyeball.
So far, Europe has always played better as a team and has made significant progress on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the US team has the courage for the fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Rider Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Rider Cup after they have come from Saturday's 4th and 4th games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a suffocating Tiger Woods to take their count so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to maintain the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that did not perform equally in the morning's four-balls, so they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not allow the resistance to shrink.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second few in the history of the Riderbecker who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played excellent together to defeat a father Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambreau with an even convincing 5-4-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashing of brilliantness, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rest during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2+1 level for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kuepka -- which is the first and third on the world ranking.
On a pleasant day, however, Europe with a little wind south of Paris did not always get their point.
Jordan Spieth, who won a big tournament three times, and Justin Thomas, on Saturday, set the mark for the Americans with two points.
They scored a difficult 2+1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after they lost the first two cats.
Only twice in the history of the Rider's cup has a team recovered from a four-point stand when they enter the single game, although Fury's team has to play just the same to keep the trophy because they already like it.
After being the second best for two days, however, it does not seem that they will be attacked on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll definitely unarm 'untrusted.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions were exacerbating their mistrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has in recent years "significant welfare measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no consistent reaction from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons that would reward North Korea if it took steps, his words seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjonng had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim took up work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security for North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pjongang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to lower strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, on which the US leader earlier spent the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue about the destruction of nuclear weapons were South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
Still, Ri's speech was dramaticly different than last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's firearms would be directed to the US' land mass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump for Kim called a "fireballman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy North Korea," Kim richly praised for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a time job for this, and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia feel that the UN Security Council must reward Pjongang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council Thursday: "Implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and uninterrupted until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has stepped up sanctions against North Korea unilaterally in an effort to put in place funding for Pjongang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outside of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea charged him only hours later that he had made "debt demands."
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to break off a missile seal and also a nuclear complex if the United States "consistent measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course over enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all its pre-graduate students more sleep in an effort to study the growing macho culture of study by countering caffeine-driven 'whole night sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world’s top university are often indifferent when it comes to the basic principles of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleeping perception on learning.
'At the end of that one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep was--which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to take the course after it was found that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to tell about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness and the importance of a sleeping tripod.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer can be increased.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know what its health effect is to choose to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride to 'all night study' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleep absorption was a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said--even to avoid it to put weight on, because sleep absorption puts the brain in a mode of starvation, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course after he had been in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to perform for a campus wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythms and cause you to struggle to reach the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga wins Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another sarcasm when Dolly Menga's target head, Steven Gerrard, was worried about a 1-0 downsizing team.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1-seat at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 contests as a driver so that his team were eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga took seven minutes for rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingstone ascends to the third and is only behind Hibernian on target.
And there may be further difficulties for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a headache after an object appears to have been thrown off the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a point from Hearts and he would have been in his nuptials in the way that his well-trained team had killed their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball ownership, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
In fact, they had to record only two minutes after Menga’s first deployment to Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the midfielder opened up his great opportunity.
A deep freeze by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only misdirect at the rear end.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there was more hope than belief about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a sentence at the quarterpoint when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but divorce judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was seriously harassed by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and an easy target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening door at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep system of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he rolled Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the shift had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly chased from his strip to the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett who had long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the last stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get in from the corner.
Rangers' deputy Glenn Middleton had another warrant for a criminal charge when he got through with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almac: The inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" German: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEACHER ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Teller.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, such as in the 1950s "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these envelopes in place, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans, "Honey, it's cracking around!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is alive.
New cancer component can learn the immune system to 'see' row cells
New cancer can teach the immune system to see and kill predator cells
Disposal teaches immune system to identify rodent cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them to a laboratory
They can then see a protein that's common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who has been treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2 and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising disorder."
HER2 "drives the growth of several kinds of cancers," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West began with a pro-Trump joke after his performance on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was staged during a Saturday Night Live at the workshop after an outstanding act in which he believed US President Donald Trump and said he would make him a favourite in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he marched out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and theirs, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not sown, the imagery of West’s shell was loaded on social media by Comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to make fun of West by putting it on.
Also, at the hearing, West complained that he was having trouble raising what he was wearing on his head.
"They bled me behind the raised roof.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They kissed me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
The West said, "Do you want to see the low place?" He said, "He would wear his "superman" because it means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to move the world forward?
Try love."
His comment at least two times triggered an adjournment at the hearing, and members of the SNL roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become a dead end."
West was introduced as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Space Clatter Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the captain of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said, "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for being on the table."
But Kletsppprogramgaswoman Karen Hunter argued that the West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who I believe accept an ideology and preach that endangers my society.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the spacecrafter announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the beings that were once known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-rymkletser, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, a white musical-legged Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who had previously been known as Prince.

Game of Thrones-ster Kit Harington criticises toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is known for his swordlike role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be respectful.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he thought 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic boyhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his master from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he 'reasonably strong' felt about working on this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with manhood?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television is very likely responsible for growth in toxic manhood because of its extremely malelike nature.
He continued, "What is born and what is taught?
What are taught on TV and in the streets that make young boys feel that they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones' chases-- and chases--when the series next summer came to an end, because he said he was 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November onwards, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-croned fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married at the funeral of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, his health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who did HIV this way was almost zero, Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
MIV transfer through sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70 - 90% of men who had sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff leader has released GOP senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
The United States Republic Maxine Waters issued on Saturday claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislation's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are motivated by "ultra rights" experts and websites.
"Truths, lies, and still ignominious lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The requested information reportedly included the address and phone numbers for the US Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the locations related to the Waters office and announced the information of a member of Waters staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued the Waters.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk as a result of this deceptive and false claim -- was not at all responsible for the outcome of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly triggered online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Water’s reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to light Waters in the middle election from the cosmos, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
"We'll make sure that the guards are exposed," she went on, "and that they'll be legally responsible for everything they do that's destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Review - naked Rowan Atkinson spyspottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit symbol in any new movie with a British inscription and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy sputteryfrenchise - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn further difficult.
Will tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfying about the subject of how obvious power we are is the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the helpless Johnny English with his eyelids and rubber face had his license renewing everything for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English film audiences.
Of course, he is the late secret agent who, despite his peculiar claim to sophisticated elegance, had a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire-team at the openness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, who Atkinson had once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest edition of JE.
I liked Johnny English who ran into a helicopter while he was dressed in a middle-aged pancake forest and cut the scraps short against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels fairly thin and peculiarly superior, especially when the "serious" movie trading brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now use comedy with confidence as an ingredient.
The humour feels that it is better for children than for adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silence traps in the person of Bean.
The permanent thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the agent's frustration at service--a pitiful little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last strand for a prime minister who is a blasted and haunted character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse of political unwelcomeness: Emma Thomspson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's only little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is in danger, she must summon someone from her retreat.
And that means the shocking Johnny English himself, now serving as a teacher at some noble institution, but giving lessons from the record about how to be a secret agent, there are some pretty jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spying school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long-term companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allegorical role in which little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are about to reassess everything completely in Her Majesty’s secret service and come down to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful fatal Ophelia Bullettova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister came under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems — the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey from ridiculous escapades: stuttered as waiters they put a French restaurant on fire, cause their chaos when they smuggle themselves on board of Volta's luxury oil; and English lets pure anarchy break out when he tries to use a chapter for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as nice and as expensive as it may be, the whole affair is quite like child TV.
Fairly moderate.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really made his talent come right?
Work denies that it thinks a plan for Britte to work for a four-day week but for five days to be paid
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party needs to consider a drastic plan that will cause Britta to work for four days -- but for five days.
Some claim that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving up their extra day.
It'll make workers enjoy a three-day week -- but they'll still get the same payment home.
Sources say that at the economic agenda and plans of the party to put the country in favor of the workers, it will be 'appropriate'.
To change to a four-day week by the Trades Union Congress signed as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Senior Labour Party brooch told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party that promised a four-day workweek in 2017 during its campaign for the general election.
The ambition, however, is currently not signed by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson of the Workers Party said: 'A Thursday week is not some policy and is not considered by the party.'
Skaddu Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explore his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'unsealed directors' and 'winners' to service companies.
The Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back, since an employer's government can make 'reductions' on the basis of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company management and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who can receive annual dividends from up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells them "60 Minutes" or the FBI's Kavanaugh survey can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that Sunday was broadcast, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for a Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could put up anything that could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and that charge came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
"He was determined, certainly, without doubt, inattentive."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be unchangeable.
"I formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would require a charge of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett fiercely denied it," continued Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who she calls could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Burger Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive group of stars that acts and has an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands will stream to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only acts by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the occasion to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Burger Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Darms Project, an international pre-accession group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card for the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concert participants had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was 12 - year - old Worldburger who was left to reach his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Worldburger has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different objectives.
It says that these actions helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that would potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion was already paid out or collected.
The group estimates that so far the confirmed money has had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based company of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ulllman in April 2018 during a concert in London for the crowd.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were taken to bring the UK closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with malnutrition.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Worldburger replied, "It will be a long and hard path--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-participation movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more strength together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will take part at this year’s New York’s event, which will be offered by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use fleets for "blocks" to prevent exports of Russian energy - Minister of Internal Affairs
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, revealed the US Minister of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legal government - is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he claimed.
According to a certain official, there are ways and means of handling them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seas are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure their energy did not come into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the audience on an occasion offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a win-win which they consider to be the "voice of the energy user" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to handling Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, a little or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The conclusions come as Trump administration was on a mission to replace the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe with a leap to Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump Berlin Moscow makes "prisoners".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, said at a meeting with American Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US view triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it seriously" to stand as president in 2020, the Senator of Massachusetts said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "consider it seriously" to stand as president after the midterm elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider it to stand.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our fragmented government and it includes a woman in the highest sport," she said according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider standing for the president."
Warren laughed at her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and he said "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very well - known in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
On a two-day Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think they should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-five percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator did not stand, according to the Suffolk University of Political Research Centre/Boston Globe.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high profile democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former fish president Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Praying said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin called Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September
He was arrested Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes on, what he has gone on since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who felt the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers returned," she told an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air force and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault by a woman, interference with complaints of domestic violence and possession of firearms while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 States, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District Columbia support a legal challenge to a new US policy that rejects asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend of the court order Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions trial submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not made public.
She says to her mate "and her violent sons have abused her," but American officials have refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was kept in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, described as nations that face deep problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals which allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "neglects state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will certainly be made on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court order.
Prosecutors further argued in the legal order that the policies that deny immigrants access damage the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration lawyers in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their country of birth due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems — not even all serious problems — that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate Rescue Efforts in Palu as death doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is growing.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her healthy babysitter at a clearinghouse in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for drunken possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-wide shaking, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s weather hospital where patients are treated outside due to constant strong back shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed by the wall's dirt, I think," Harris told the Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I called my wife for help, but then stopped.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador charges China with 'disconnection' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that called for the mutual benefits of U.S. trade, the U.S. ambassador to China Beijing accused the U.S. press of being used to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid inception in the Des Moines Register – the state's newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of joining the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections, noted what US officials told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalating trade war that has brought their tariff rounds on each other's imports.
China’s early payroll in the trade war aimed to beat executives in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and Iowa's former governor for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion poll in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now intensifys the knockout by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited divergent voices at the newspaper kiosk in Beijing here and not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, giving that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was afraid of the offer to publish its article", although he did not say what newspaper.
Republics foreign women's electorate for inter-election with Kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
While many top republics at the Supreme Court are known as Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the upcoming elections they would see a counter-reaction, especially of women.
The emotions about this go tremendously high, and most Republicans are reminded that they already indicate that they want to proceed with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s appeal for an FBI investigation into the nippert will be enough to settle fierce voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, combatants "November is on the way!" were terrified as they marched into the Senate's entrance gate while the Republicans who had chosen the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the press.
"People say it was already high; it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among poorly-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony that sets out the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-recognized statement, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republics continued to confirm it.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republics handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, pointed out to the news channel a group that helps choose Democrats.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with slightly more to choose from.
A new survey of YouTube shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or likely to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely seen during his witnessing, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s prosecution, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported.
Ford vowed last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17 when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court has revealed to her her sexual features while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web is planning to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, leads a startup that tries to interact with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that developed on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed the idea of Inrupt as "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely based on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about announcing an overall change anyway, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a position on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoriacruis-spiritual feast
The only minister of the Church of England who won the Victory Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.koll’s honor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp shot and never knew that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbols" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, lt.col. On 29 September 1918, his battalion led over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "by a very dense mis and under heavy fire from the fields and machinery donors."
He later rushed him to the fire line and with the "most bravery" led the line forward before he only stormed a field gun and blew out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act is "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also went to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jeugorkes.
Michael Vann said he "felt afraid to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people will give."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine yourself awake at night to watch the packed Bellator 206 just to be unable to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly by night in the United States on Channel 5.
At about 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to talk to each other about the fight, viewers in the United States were shocked when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were un startled after staying awake especially for the fight until early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the child image as "one or other sick joke."
"It's a government regulation that the content was not suitable around 6 nm and therefore they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior fish president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the girl," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include future VK viewers.
"I think that when I think of the broadcast, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it changed, there were many text messages sent over and over again, and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen the next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just go over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't know before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had aired his feelings about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that to become a parent, he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years’ long program, Kirsty Young, took off a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less than, and otherwise feel, the real things that have given me the power and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Australian State Federation Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he laughed because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give other “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "has caught him on the side."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you go through such a young age," he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that he changed his "whole perspective".
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son died of the same name as his father Robert, who died at age 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that her father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked for or they already had maps for London 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not unusual," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of for a long time--to dive before my homecoming at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in the construction of the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson not on the move and withdraw to Saturday’s Ryderbecker
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider win game, but he will have to get his shape straight to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the two-year event, was pulled off by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-digit games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major-winning will divide his day in between to be a raisin leader and on the practice bub at his game work in hopes of correcting what's going on.
Even at the top of his career he was never the most direct driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long ruvelt always penalizes the dwindling waves.
And as if the job on its own wasn't challenging enough, mickelson comes to stand in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked together with new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, begin the 12 single games well, Mikkelson’s match can be absolutely necessary.
Furik expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role he had today, gave me a blow on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is in the Heldesaal and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I put more into perspective, but that’s how things worked out, and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday for the player who played most of the Ryderbek contests.
This may mark the end of a racing career that has never really matched the peaks of its individual performance.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven half, although Furik said that his presence had contributed to the team’s hideous aspects.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to cut the fool, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the panic room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed cutting with him crazy, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great progress can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day's single game in the Riderbecker can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dean made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where the team under the leadership of Seven Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but won only nail scratch with 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"A man keeps reminding himself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won our nail tie," said Bjorn, on the photo, after watching how the 2018 Class won 5-3 and yesterday was 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoice in how his players were in danger on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of another color.
It's great to be out there with a friend when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his nephew Jim Furik will want his players to go better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furik himself was already on both sides of that great last-day fence, where he was part of the wish team at Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser when Europe had achieved the "miracle of Medina".
"I remember every hidden word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke up his players courageously on the way to that last day.
"We had 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brooklyn, as was seen at Medina.
When that moment begins to run in one direction, it puts much stress on that middle contest.
So we set up our team and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of attempting to lead the attack and came in the main fight against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who is the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I chose this group secretly in this order, for I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single-game choices.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The German army’s latest frregat would have been used in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War Age, but it will not be there until at least the following year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" is now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Time newspaper quoted by a military spokesman.
This vessel was supposed to join the Fleet in 2014, but the worrisome post-flight issues have affected this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a damp air- and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to operate the latest fractals for up to two years away from the tuishavens.
However, continuous delays mean that the advanced warships — apparently allowing Germany to design power overseas — will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, called The Time.
The disastrous F125 fleet made a record last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Fleet sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media said that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" would render the ship useless if it was deployed in a fight.
Software defects are especially important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – just half the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was dramatically overweight, reducing the work performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the price label for the whole project – including the training of the crew – also became a question.
It has evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the original €2.2 billion.
Problems that have plagued the new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Fleet's "ships that can be deployed are underway."
The officer said that the issue had worsened over time, since old ships were out of service, but no replacement vehicles were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes could join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to Flying Mouse’s Secret Life
New research is carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano butterfly mouse as well as the brown long and daubenton butterfly mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track fluorescent activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using manual indicators.
Expert canals of all recordings will check the frequency of the bats and determine which species they are doing.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant for NTS hope to discover what habitat areas are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as wildlife and how to manage forests best for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and throughout the United States, bat populations have declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects sleepiness and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Flying mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They're using a sophisticated echo-oriented technique to show goggies and obstacles on their wings.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land around the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do recordings and sleep - health inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thraveland in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Land manager David Thompson says that the land is the ideal place for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many livestock trees and all the good habitat.
But there are so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to flourish."
He emphasises the need to search for bats before conservation is done in property because it is possible that unaware destruction of a single shell can mean the death of 400 females and young children and can destroy a whole local population.
Flying mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them from destroying their sleeping quarters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations go."
Ronaldo makes allegations of rape while prosecutors are preparing to review German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo dropped rape charges against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His prosecutors are ready to witness the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus predictor was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 at a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," the five-time balloon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's prosecutor is preparing to review Der Spiegel's claim, which they called, according to Reuters, "unallowable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount that matches the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to the alleged incident on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" left in the loop by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a trial outside the court because she was "feared for revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the sentence now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack on the point of joining Manchester United at Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'always repent' if their engine manufacturers lose
The UK 'will repent forever' if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "comfortable" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to suspend its temporary production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-agreement Brexit can be seen as food.
The Burnaston plant – produced by Toyota's Auris and Avensis – last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK engine manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their mini-installation in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "not time-consuming" basis, with components arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the US leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be distortion on the border which the company says can lead to delays and deficiencies in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to continue more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire facility, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement, we want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what a very successful set of supply chains were."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but she warned that in the long term, added costs could reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the UN's collaborator on the site, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when this post disappears, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Whitehouse
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be "exposed for another week" while the fight over nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Legal Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election intervention, links between Trump-helpers and Russia and possible law-enforcement by the president.
Whether Trump is going to thank the deputy prosecutor general or not, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip stories have been on fire for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's court hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump continued a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for it has not yet been determined; it may be this week, I can see that it is delayed with another week with all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders have not held a White House press session since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not because of a objection to TV journalists who are "effect-hunting", although she said, "I will not argue with the fact that they are effect-hunting."
She admitted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly for the president of the United States questions, it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen a lot of it over the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a pernicious session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press statements are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and timeless appearance to journalists who were together.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express the hope that they will stay in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the US withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed themselves to covering costs of negotiated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the US and the EU continued on withdrawal, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the U.K. government has also stepped up their preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each employee’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major injury
Tennessee State Tigers' liner Christian Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a major injury on Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee Sponge's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief executive, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the edge and sort of collapsed there," said Reed.
Practitioners and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the edge before being placed on a portable and rearward for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/range of the wound" and Tennessee still tried to find when the wound occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He killed on Saturday five times before leaving the game, bringing his total season to 18 deaths.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize Corby's attempt to draw young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the United States
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-value earners.
The increase in seal taxes will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United States, with the extra money that the government’s plans will help to counter greed.
The overload — which is outside the current seal charge, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second houses and houses purchased for rent — may be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to reach £120 million a year.
A estimated 13 percent of newly built London property is purchased by non-UK citizens who boost the prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many well-off areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become "spook towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal taxes to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to distance from affordable houses to repair Britain's "housing disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a successful series of planned improvements in housing, including rental management and an end to "no-error outputs".
He also wants to give advice more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I will devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our fragmented home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work, and build a life.
But it cannot be as easy as it is for individuals who do not live in the United States, as well as foreign - based companies to buy houses as well as hard - working British residents.
For too many people the dream of homeownership has become a dream far away, and the humiliation of lack of hares has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland Chief Jack Ross says she is "the greatest ambition" to become the head of Scotland at one stage.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing up new life in the North-East team, which is currently in third place in Liga One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after returning last season to the Scottish Prime Minister.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sport Sound.
"But as a child I often looked up with my father for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that pulled me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of following such established names at such a large club after he had previously shown off offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment will success be measured for me by ''Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just think of myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross' career in the management is only three years, after a period as assistant head at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' senior staff.
He then helped Alloa to return from religion to the third league and converted St. Mirren from religion to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his performance at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he said as he thought back on how he took over Alloa's lees.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds weird, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things you have to come through weekly.
I still go through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but management is just right.
I always wanted to drive, and now I do it, it feels the easiest I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s suffocating crow’s income, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and herd groups saw sales in July with 2.7% increase – but guests in restaurants were off with 4.8 percent, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting company CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Prepared sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking places were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drinking-leading drinks and croissants did far better and increased more than what restaurants had fallen.
Food-borne drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as severe as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Over driven cows and drinking places, sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, with food being reduced by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sports events remains the greatest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-home-out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent a year will be particularly difficult above and besides constant cost-free pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-driven operators and would only show time if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August would bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trademarks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Business Monitor collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups, with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and is the established measure in the business.

The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head report" to show parents
One of five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "Fals Insta accounts" – a reference to the photographer Instagram.
The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "head check" to show parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who came down to her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape her".
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them recognizing that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Second Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected to the council of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body’s general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job and field data and President Ian Beattie has described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from its internationally successful experience over the past decade.
"Eilid has great respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are certainly athletic in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help to teach the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has 200 meters and 400 meters at 1996 games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not run after having a short - term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would learn or I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it was fully restored, learning again how to walk and do exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
A brush-path version that compares mothers to cows sharing opinions online
A stocking company has distributed online opinions with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In celebration of what is called the "world's first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk.
Four right mothers dance in a bowl full of straw and cows on the measure of a little song that includes lyrics such as, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a star" and "If you haven't seen it, it's not eggs, it's my breasts."
The corporal said, "Smash it out, pump it out, I run the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of observations, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many who say it is playing the "graves" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
If we have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.
Elvie pump just discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another observed: "Unlikely traumas for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screaming jokes".
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had one if I was still breast - feeding.
To milk made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little bit too much, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another observed: "It's a fun ad directed at mothers who milk (usually in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are milking say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is deadly, has no wires or tubes and just discreetly in a feeding bridge that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they milk.
Ana Balarin, friend and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and exciting announcement.
By drawing a parallel between milking women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges into the shell, while we were in a fun way to find people joining the wonderful feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the run for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border organs have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to faulty rhetoric and policies established by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at home.
Traditionally, most citizens were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be compromised by moving forward to raise a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential citizens and other adult members of their households should leave their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at Immigration and Doe Maintenance, testified before Congress that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to provide unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either citizens or family members of citizens are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to hide-and-seekers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing calls, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration lawyer.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to concealment workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a greater facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child's difficulty is more easily misjudged due to the size.
They added that to move the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends, the trauma that is already very difficult can worsen.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish 'occupational powers' to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "managed accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, with other millions who have been expelled, were "almost over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to carry out this holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly against President Bashar al-Assad by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irraditional fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returnees," he said.
"They're politicizing something that just has to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebellion of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish accord has rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear spherical spells" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front who would be "cut off".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, like much liberal hope, a state of accusation and scandals will soon end his presidency.
In what no doubt "the most dramatic finals of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now, there are no signs of sighting fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time rates have been more than double to 1.05 million at CCN and almost triple to 1.6 million at MSCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak viewers, of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is above cable viewers with more than 3.5 million viewers on big news.
"It's a fire to which people have been attracted, because it's not something we understand," says Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'For he makes me laugh,' said I. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and the health of the world economy.
To turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour to watch a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 volstroustrous flying pool ("a piece of clothing thick from the hubris", The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Partly what he does makes it feel like a reality program is that he drives you something every night," says Brant Montgomery, the head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role distribution and daily kicks in the plot (such as looking for a fight with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I arrived this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while taking CNN.
He could not be cut off, Brett Kavanaugh was not on his way to appear before the Senate’s court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on the scale.
"I remember when we had done all that crazy programs and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Extraordinary stream to most exciting mid-term selection competitions at home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th century saw an influx of money, thanks to a movement of convention districts that two officials have now been in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district leaves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measured forces.
Lamb is against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overwhelmed by the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were unlawfully depreciated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th ended with a field financing competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a nail-crap win in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then deviated
Diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until friends expelled the Trump Organisation's board of directors.
Officials of the state departments decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said earlier this month in a statement.
However, fines were only considered against El Salvador that received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the Congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of El Salvador's fines.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now determined to speak to the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the conference for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new hard messages or sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultation on terms of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next thing that may happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross -breeding of the court, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's focus was probably also on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia worked together in the country's attack on our elections.
If the Congress went into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, only when he was prepared to go back before the electors, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axis, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – and not those of his equations in Europe.
There are decisions to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be resolved.
In 1938, German officials were ready to execute a state arrest against Hitler, if the West had just opposed him and supported the Czech-Slovake at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the ensuing slaughter of the years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the relentless course of democracy is being postponed or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, resigned?
Rosenstein was in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to take up the president in secret and speculate about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or justifiable – or if confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to go on Saturday candles on that table that the Swastika wear.
With this as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play Thursday hostess for Rapid Vienna knowing that winning over the Austrians, after the impressive equivalent in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knife injury prevented middle-field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2nd match against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this outcome as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but an equalisation is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult match because they had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can get through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a feeling factor in the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now pass through, sit behind us last season and be successful."
Women lose sleep over these nightmares
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it to their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the costs of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, fish-president of the National Life Insurance Business.
Here's where to start.
Speak to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Please enter your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come forward with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal battles at the passport.
Get a health care officer in place so you can assign a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and make sure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider, too, your financial standing.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are not authorized.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so that you can be ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who Will Care for the Dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Several times in Ilfracombe was shot with a windshield
A man was shot several times with a windshield when he walked home after a night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "if any".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death rate is expected to rise.
With communication put out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the center of the 7.5-wide shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Dongala is a regent that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regent, an administrative district under a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the central Sulwesi province’s economy, especially the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel - mining is also important in the province, but it is usually concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck West Dongala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the six - wheeled Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake along the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, leading to a tsunami that struck 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shells hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-range hit the south of Java, Indonesia hit the most populated island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-wide tremor occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7,5-wide tremor struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, leading to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and led to some 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking struck the Pide Jaya Regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead this time to a tsunami, but more than 100 are dead because of buildings that have collapsed,
2018: Great shakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and fish-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off a woman's phone when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained at Mat-Su Pre-trial Facility and is held on a $500 non-insurance bond, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when asked what he was arguing, reported the network.
Palin faces three class A violations in the face, which means he can lock up for up to a year and fine $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints against Palin have been made.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is now before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His daughter claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7,5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death sentences for suspected NYC earthquake attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City earthquake attack that caused the death of eight people – a rare penalty that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental engine to launch an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to harvest pedestrians and a bicycle driver who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "consciously" killed the eight victims and "consciously" suffered serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, filed in the South District of New York.
Both of those charges bear possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for the benefit of repression, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said and described the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the South District of New York prosecuted a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but finally, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after their sentence for a conspiracy to execute spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were hit with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He mentioned to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the persecution.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a debt to life imprisonment with no possible release, just the trauma of these events will extend to all the concerned." Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in the control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's forces" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "hot" of Eurosceptic – as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he must be in the control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative banker Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that by the time Mr. Farage Brexit was secretary, the UK had been "soo".
But the challenge that Mrs. May face to unite her deep-separated officers by calling on pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime challenge is to keep her Chequers compromise plan moving in the midst of attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Allieds insisted that she would press the door in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the death march – and Eurosceptic and Labour force to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Run Meaning of the Solihull Walk Conference that he wanted to throw out "Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I will rise for Brexit, but we must throw out Chequers.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain completely false.’
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkins was also at the march and told reporters: ‘ I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with some of us and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are chosen in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘The prime ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ’
Mr. Colore said that convention politicians had to feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a trust between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit feel the heat.
‘We mobilize the people’s strength from this country that has won our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding an assembly for two hours in the city center.
A few activists have warned Tories against Brexit banners after the group's announcement this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis has ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they have endured with a party application like the conference opened.
"It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
'It's a total trick.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "look hard at it" to stand for the president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP, Rep Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the midst of speculation that her Trump may be challenging in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A roommate asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it shuts in a woman quite above."
Arrested in Shooting of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in the image.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and was finally killed because of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media every 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 advancements last season and held an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rejuvenation balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton hits world title after team commands gave him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team commands would play a major role in the rations.
From the palace position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and called for Bettel to attack his comrade.
Bettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton behind to ride in the traffic, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes took a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action which the Ferrari driver had left the risk-free internal view at risk of surviving a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the rear row of the road jumper and was seventh toward the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large part of the rations as he held on to his straps to quickly prepare and cross Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the pits on the 44th rounds, but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done amazingly many weekends and was a true lord.
The team did outstanding work to have one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a real bad lift.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a convention on Saturday about her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the Supreme Court of sexually assaulting Brett Kavanaugh.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was said in the Senate indicated that people were "common and unscrupulous and liars".
"The only thing that can happen and the nice thing that has happened over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and lying," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you've leaked the document--oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it... No, we didn't lick it," he added, in a preamble of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that stated the charges in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was earlier leaked in September — but Feinstein denied the leak from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not welcome her denial and commented during the Saturday night's convention: "I tell you what.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst lift I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-recognition accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the community, the inequity, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to care for to get power and control," media reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer cast two targets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars agreed for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday’s 5-3 match in Dundee.
The Giants got an early two-way lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the household team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard compared Dundee before two Lucus Lundvald Nielsen-targets captured their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had lost their first match and when Friday night won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull-help, with David Rutherford offering the help when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer surely made the Giants take the lead in the first break when he threw his second goal from the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard got them again like a force target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen to let Dundee lead for the first time in the game in the second half and made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people was safely lifted.
More than 800 people are killed and more are missing after a major earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained unmoved to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the scene, was able to climb safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he daydreamed it together.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart breaks to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll may reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency, which says that access to the villages of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death rate is still increasing as many bodies are still under construction while many cannot be reached," said agent president Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves that reached six feet [6 m] had blown Palu to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hunting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to disembarkation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesian plane accident: Air Niugini says now one man is missing after a beachside plane accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific seabed in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The Air Force said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while it tried to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The air service said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. fleet said that the plane had landed near the runway in the beach.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was overrun.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through the middle depth of water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airtights had panicked and yelled and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships that worked near the improvement of a key also helped with a blasting boat with the rescue to get people to land before sinking the plane in about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airfields in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice-Analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence-analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different phones that showed that Telllis and Chambers were together on the night of her death, which was in conflict with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said, "Look, because my truck was in Nashville."
It's quite an inconsistencies that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis Chambers deleted his messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He certainly had her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin its final Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and the packaging of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and repopulate conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a recent revision in the United States by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Enough black person?!
New Baby Woman Journalizes Couples because it's derived from "racist" text
A New York-child's wife is dating a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong address message from the mother who complained that she was "a pretty black person".
The couple deny that they are racists and compare the matter with "pression."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two, was upset when she found out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEY NOG A Black Person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice.
After she made her mistake, an "uneasy" Plasco-Faxman thanked me Maurice and said that they had done bad work on the part of the African-American stepdaughter and that she had expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent with a Uber home.
Now Maurice's going to get the couple for compensation for the fine and looking for his compensation up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident works for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such a good," she told the post Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple recalled the claims that they were racist and said that it was reasonable to end Maurice’s submission and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a race.
We are not racist people," the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were unscathed, even though it was through the bush?
Your first father?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "pressing" and said that his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going behind such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
As the case continued, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington publishers were afraid that a talking bear would not link readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been hot if his work was rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "sweet" last year.
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family", she added that her father was still a little proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he was not an orange man," she said.
"But because Paddington was right for him, it was almost as if one had a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not your job.
I think he considered Paddington’s success kind of success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm very fond of you, heartlam.
Soon I will be with you.
I will be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was just a little before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was developed.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who at the time was injured for the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers on board the plane - unconscious of the trial she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head sucked and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the run I got an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Griefing women post cards to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's mail cards have been on a Wallis Bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
My son, Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself on 18th.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an onslaught.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had cleared up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
I said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still. You have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas -- when the children opened their presents, he did not contact them or do anything to them."
She said her death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work by it: "It was a hole through the family.
This divides us.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is as uncertain as the FBI’s investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like that he asked for--a timeless investigation that didn't stop--we could perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "falling apart" under the narrowest partitional opening.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their presence is all because of timing.
The elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as is expected, the Republics go bad, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to find the man they want to choose to go to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and whom he met with his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which Mike Pence, the president of the fish, will allow to break an equal play and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea is running numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean warriors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-and seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-sug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 surges - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said more stringent border control between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Finally, the vast majority of those running from the North are offered South Korea civil law.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of the flights through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, are easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
The Chinese regard the warriors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriate them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South — still technically speaking in war with each other — have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the ongoing negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress since Saturday.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histories," he says he is incapable of serving at the Supreme Court
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court the Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said that he was temporarily incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered the comment on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they'd say 'histories'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times he almost screamed and yelled while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "sudden and coordinated murder of character," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself unqualified with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was alarmed when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the Laerhaus.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not competent to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is now," said Pelosio.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Appelhof.
Pelosi added that she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Cheap Care of Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women should handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boils; and she cannot get it without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive, who said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for Tom because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office was where I once found that I cried with nameless anger and was seized by an older woman at my neck--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a report.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy, because they have affected you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an out-of-court relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the bars, Schroeder, very frustrated me, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well of the decision," she said to me smiling 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the games and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the fight, she was behind with warrants and so she made a vow that she wouldn't go in unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I get fired?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to paint voters rather than delegates, and angry for the sexism--that she laughed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder called me about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleinex was my corporate bond.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my gravestone?
"She's been crying?"
How the U.S. China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening vow of the trade war between the U.S. and China was overexceeding, and while the battle is over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial in the long term to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, set the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese executions, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week’s most interesting escalation involved new tariffs that affect items of $200 billion (£150 billion) and effectively charge half of the goods coming into the United States of China.
Beijing took revenge every time in goods and recently hit the US$60 billion price of five to ten percent.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shoot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington back means to surrender to requests, but to meet in public to the US's requests will be too much of a shame to Xi Jinping, China's President.
Experts still say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, pressure on the US trade war on the long - term China can support positively by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that could start an economic toll in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than what observers had previously known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the land that was destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that their daily lives and their existence have taken.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the coastal land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had contributed to the attack.
Europe sealed Driver Beer Victory in Paris
Span Europe won the 2018 Rider Cup and Span U.S.A. with a final point from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn drew the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty in most of the tournament, let her T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th gate and gave his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari appeared in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world’s highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Rider cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder beakers, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a bad year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia to the European victory.
He hands over the box to his countrymate John Ram who won the Sunday U.S. Stunning Tiger Woods 2+1 in some games.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked back old," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods has lost four of his competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 racetrack Ryder.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 big titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. made it a very difficult week to find the cleaning area with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf all over the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing execution on behalf of his team: "I am proud of these monks.
There was a time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We're done.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Rider pool committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 cousins and am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat clean.
We're out of line."
Newest about Rediety: Reduced concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Natural Life Commission shows a general decrease in Rediety concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, colliding blood conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier cities — suggesting reduced concentrations.
In full bloom, the Rooigety extends about 130 miles along the coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee cities.
Kolle can be found about 10 miles close to the coast of Hillsborough, but at less locations compared to last week.
