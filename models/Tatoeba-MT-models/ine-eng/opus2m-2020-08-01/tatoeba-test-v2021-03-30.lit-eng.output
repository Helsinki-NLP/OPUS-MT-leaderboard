The baby was gone all night.
She didn't like it in town.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do what you want.
That man you saw yesterday is my grandfather.
I don't like winter.

But he knew it couldn't go on.
Probably not.

I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't believe it (don't wait) too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.

I'll help you.
It's your fault.
Who are you looking for?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are sweeter.
Who's there?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had a woman's head, a leprous body, a bird's wings, and a bird's tail.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to jump with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.

Please just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.

I still remember the times when we had a fight with you.
When we go to sleep, we say "good night."
Scandal broke his career.
Cats are complex for individuals.
He was so poor that he could not buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Go home before six.
Duona's fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be bad anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The bells lit the room.
I'm sorry.
Put the paper in half.
What does he write in his letter?

I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas could not stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.

Are you ready to start your trip?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They betrayed you.

We believe in God.
I'm Irish.
Here's the man I've been waiting for.

I asked her to wait a minute.
How did you begin to learn the languages of others?
They don't pose a threat.
Her advice moved me to move abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places are these tours visited?
That's why we played inside.

But I don't want to.

Tonight, you look just wonderful.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.

Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What music does Thomas like?
That tree grows near her home.
Don't talk in the classroom.
How are you doing, panel?
I'm changing the gender into dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Thomas is going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I were rich, I'd give you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where did you fuck them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious. It's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This rise is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why didn't anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She said that.
What a beautiful night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.

Look at the train running through the bridge.
I'm not the only one who loves Tom.
Now I'm really tired.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I've got thirty pendulums.
It looked like a joke.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
That's similar.
Be careful, okay?
This is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I love that.
Tom's gonna need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I can see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Put your hand up before you answer.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true that you have a gun?

When the spring comes, the days become longer than the day.

Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.

You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I don't see anything from here.
Since I didn't get the answer, I signed it again.
She's standing outside the wall.
Don't trust me too much.
They've missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I've had one beer and I've had a lot of drinking.
Thomas didn't think he needed a personal guard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her go into the park.
I don't think you're busy.
You didn't look like you wanted those books.
I've got a red bike.
It's low and heavy.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was a tiring one.
He's much smarter than me.
Thomas still doesn't seem interested.
It's a terrible weather today.
I didn't want this to happen.
He's trying to get out of here.
As I said, I won't do anything.

Cupnuts are often used in the wilderness.

Good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting your time and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
To be happy is completely normal.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
Yesterday, my hand was hurt.
If I were rich, I'd give you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father didn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed me on my stomach and wanted to spend the night.
My friend's here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Thomas doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
I'll see you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.

Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be walking in that tunnel.
When will the snow melt?
He was thinking about what I was really tired of.
I don't think she's eating anymore.
Either you're with us or before us.
Please help me!
Thomas knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's blowing up a dog.
He went to the store, but he stopped at her house.
Snow is moving fast.
We're here south.
Of course I should read this book.
Thomas is not in prison right now.
Tom and Mary went to the museums.
The ship went beyond the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.

The result was disappointing.
I got through the window.
Meat is not yet ready.
Give me a piece of cake.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Can you turn on the light?
He doesn't trust the doctor anymore.
It was the first time I visited museums.
We've spent a great deal of time.
I think Thomas wants to sit down.
What a nice family.
Are you still in Florida?
You didn't have to eat those green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow's the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The Swedish capital is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
Cat's over the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm teaching Lozban.
"Good morning," said Tom smiling.
I'm hurting my hand.
He needs a cupcake.

You have to buy your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He got lost and didn't want to.
They work eight hours a day.
I'm eating and drinking.
I do that every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I'll take away what I said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I got inside through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly recorded our names.
Our son died in the war.
It is not satisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you what's going to happen first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We're all better off anyway
What is the person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going to buy.
Everything that's genius is simple.
Her students learn too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Let's have some lunch.
Birds leave for the south.
This tea is very nice.
I don't agree with him.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
We'll have enough of that.
I wasn't.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became an honest man.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took the piece off the bench.
Let me do it.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and let in the fresh air.
Have you ever had a snake?
It's tough.
Did you see my mom?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she's doing?
He came here before he finished his lessons.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat was lying on my back, and she didn't want to die.
There are several good hotels in the city.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to learn today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for $30.
That's great.
It's no method, it's a provocation.

What's your address?
Tomorrow he'll be free.
Didn't you see my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Thomas will be dead soon.
I'm used to going to sleep late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're basketball players.
These clothes are good for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care.
Thomas could not find the reason why he had to return early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I can't believe you're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand anything we want.
Thomas is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I told you I'd call another one later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs it more than she needs it.
Happy break-up!
Tommy, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
