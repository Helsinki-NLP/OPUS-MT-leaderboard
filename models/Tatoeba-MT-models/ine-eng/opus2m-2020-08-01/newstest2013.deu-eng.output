A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter for a myth, confirming that the election fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by the lightning.
In the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud have been reported by the Republican lawyers in the United States for 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermined by the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for holding elections in individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have been publishing new laws since 2009 that make it difficult to register or enter.
After the November 2010 elections, 675 new republican representatives could be listed in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative drafts were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of electoral rights in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to provide a photo of light and evidence of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for the preliminary vote, declare the right to register as a voter on the election day, and grant citizens the right to vote for which a judicial act is in place.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state has asked voters to display a photo of light.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a demand.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities agreed to extend this practice to other countries.
In the last two years, they have promoted legislation in 34 federal states that force voters to display a photovoltaic display.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a photovoltaic certificate issued by a government authority in their country.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such evidence in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often paid to obtain the necessary evidence.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and low-income people are immeasurably affected.
In fact, 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with income of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the necessary photo evidence.
That's still enough.
Students who are considered to be voters who vote more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photovoltaic evidence issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state requested evidence of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first federal state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures clearly aim to limit Hispanic votes.
Because it is up to two out of three Hispanic voters to favor the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight federal states which abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns for electoral registration in the 2004 general elections have contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new voters by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other federal states have adopted laws aimed at shortening the time limit for the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters elected in advance were Afro-Americans, although they accounted for only 13% of voters in the federal state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of the people who had chosen in advance.
In contrast, the whites representing 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to put the most controversial laws down.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have adopted laws requiring the prediction of a light display.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics undermine the party's political nature of the adopted laws and clearly see in them the impact of the results in the states that will expire in 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral Committee to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermined by the US democratic system.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test shows sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger delay of the previously undecided men for carrying out early identification tests.
Whether or not to make the test
We have drawn the opinion of two experts.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that in a 12-year follow-up study, the probability of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 or 40 years of age if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent also have a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
Patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of their cancer by showing them the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is preferable to decide for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, in many men who have been diagnosed with cancer, there is no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active surveillance and are offered treatment in advance of the disease.
The criteria for a decision which should be dealt with and which should not be dealt with are increasingly accurate.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
Most importantly, however, it is important to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed.
In cooperation with the international company for urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for Canadian cancer society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unclear.
For Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to Canadian cancer society, excess weight and adipositas also contribute to the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, breast, abdominal, stomach, abdominal and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against heart cancer throughout life," he adds.
Food
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of developing severe or mastic cancer.
Roots should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to cancer development," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not final.
After the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family responsibilities.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyses
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has made some observation last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is not less involved than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but empirically has not yet been observed.
But for the physicists it's not quite sure that it's really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it looks like the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be completely secure about it.
Still, let's assume that it's actually about the Higgs, because there seems to be only a small risk of cheating, and let's look at what's going on.
There is a legally binding law in this world that makes it impossible for two objects to be present at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too hard as you will grieve.
For even if particle physics is a really rare world, it turns out that it also applies to them a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", while this "state" consists in large and full of some of its properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called fermione and are politely obeyed the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil band of anarchists, who are not sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley Laboren (which is absolutely amazing) in two groups: the Mesones that we will not be treated here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature spread and which would somehow be related to the Higgs boson.
However, it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "offer" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "distorted" right here, in like a silage stone, which was thrown into a pond.
This "distortion" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photo and thus one of the bosons "bearer of power".
Stabilized field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "distorted" so that this boson can be shown.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the trigger must reach very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold from the refrigerator itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as well as the photos) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research now be "good", does Mrs. Plamond ask?
For science, they serve the verification of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists to investigate carefully all the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
There are many physicists who seem to hope that such deviations will be found, since the smallest difference opens a door to a "new physics" and could stop some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, since there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that is about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups! again).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at the CERN.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent striker (the first to be pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a "labor play".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be issued from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969 Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eyes" and has introduced the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With her committee for "Die in Würde", Quebec recently discussed the heic question of the end of life.
The debate needs to be resumed in a short time, although a draft legislation is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devor has tried to look this up.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that took him up had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in his home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived on Monday.
"But it's always a shock, and you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immeasurable weakness prevents her from going to the toilet alone and even eating herself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he is willing to resign to help with the meal.
Courage can even make him laugh and talk to strangers who are around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my past because this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pinkled in the stand," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some.
"This depends on the ability of the person," he says.
Because according to several people working in palliative care, large events take place in the middle of these steps.
Patients who are enrolled in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For a woman A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by stabbing".
But because of the illness, I really knew my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says before she accepts a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she expects another last visit of her son from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, you can offer a group of voluntary body care and assistance in food intake.
Palliative care is then used if there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
A bed for palliative care is available to 11,700 inhabitants in Quebec.
That's very little when you consider that one day we're all going to die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the world.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You'll give the dying person whatever you want to do with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will pour out the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports Nathalie Savard.
In Victor-Gadbois's home is not a day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his head cushions, while one attacks his honor, a 36-year-old man dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, in a tragic way after trying to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been covered with cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients enrolled in the home Victor-Gadbois come from their place of residence, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that should relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacies in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of a law on the regulation of death assistance and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all rights to high-quality palliative care before accepting death assistance.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in emergency hospital for 14 days without taking action to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst predictions to the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a serious chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was going to give up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me I was at the end!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have prayed to die thank the care staff that this wish did not occur after their pain was relieved by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the leader of palliative care of the household palliative care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not talk about pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, physicians often resort to terminal sedation, which leads to patients being either sporadic or permanent until their death.
We can't do that anymore than if we don't notice this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more likely to respond to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to sleep with me," but "I want my pain to be alleviated".
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate canals large sizes in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, companies of the construction industry, money suppliers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and Mafios are trapped.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has collapsed since drastic action has been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was detected by him on the basis of an in-depth examination of the resurgences related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only voted against.
The "Duchesnew report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and the protection of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes that "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them lent their instincts in order to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought about two mayors", he adds, in the hope that they will be able to "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 Anti-Corruption Unit Opened to Life
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of economic auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the policemen of the "Marteau-Truppe", which since 2009, have made Montreal's "canalization cartel" more attractive in the artistic settlement of the contracts...
In recent weeks she has specifically conducted domestic investigations and raised charges for fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received butter money in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito, were explicitly accused.
The Commission's last observation was by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "System" for the award of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a broker associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand at stake in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He was also asked to have organised an illegal procurement for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canal contracts the costs of which have been artificially incurred
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as savings of $736,000 as a counter-performance for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially paid.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they let themselves slip by artificially bluffing the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, one of the organizers of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay withdrew in early November, which brought Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Members of Montreal to beat the alarm.
As mayor of the town district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property for $5 million and was resold in the booming real estate market from 2010.
70% Black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is finally carried out, she says that she "draws on a thread that allows her to understand the functioning of the system that is submerged by ameis to stop the evil and push the guilty".
She says that the procedure was "suffering but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, however, only need a specific detection unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on the other hand, that "persons have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but especially thinks about the role of "mandaters who are in the picture about tactics," if they were not deceived!
As a result of a 70% black dollar in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a weak abslaught of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to $100, which would not change the situation according to it: "If the election expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by taking the courage to do so, we can rebuild the house on a stronger basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international view of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau asks those who smile about it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game, this is even easier.
Everything's going very fast in football.
But I don't burst into enthusiasm.
Since I started at the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
They therefore take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals this summer are used to wearing very high levels of games.
You also know that every training unit is successful.
This leads to a player like me having to offer the star and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti honors all technicians.
In League 1 there is currently no comparable person, and it is among the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1 Lyon took us to the top rider's seat.
But we're in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have thus qualified for the Eighth Final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can withdraw the play of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win title and become a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financially able to adopt concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great mistake not to win the title in the League 1 as it was in the last season?
Of course this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really up to us to cancel this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We have ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is right.
Even if the great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are calling for the title, I think we have enough to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that many of us are expected.
We accept that perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can throw at us, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with a 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team is building up with time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that hasn't been able to qualify for the eighth final since two seasons, and that has also done huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point jump!
That said that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better to talk about a Zlatan dependency.
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many doors.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of the League 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has made it clear that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible for all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from getting out of play.
I've seen things that I've been working on.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the Blues.
From what happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lessons, and today we have to set a good example of conduct.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshamps at the top of the "Blue"?
He has achieved many promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, closes the players and sets out to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is this a forced decision in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's used to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as often as in these technologies, there is a political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro, etc. convertible) as well as a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin course in June 2011 reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros), it fell to two dollars five months later, before it recovered to about ten dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to advance in a video game that can be won or bought by games (and sometimes also exchanged back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously the account holder, auditors, cash issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data relating to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are available in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to introduce this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is started on the computers, while the winner, who is a type of provisional central banker, has the privilege of adding these additional lines.
This is a fragment of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add it a number before the whole is "sucked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is correct.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice as fast (less than 10 minutes) for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unconnected as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be half regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided into a hundred million set, leaving a certain amount of space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the performance of the calculation.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin devices were stolen.
"The weakness used does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real-money payment company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, Bargund also shows this flaw.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the bill and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-closing" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
Furthermore, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply have to specify only one address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat indicates that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to identify where hierarchical systems are considered in favour of stronger horizontal systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin is implemented, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also proposes to reassess the various risks that are considered to be high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We're retired from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States were expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army seizes the property of its territory again and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves killed with our 88 soldiers, as well as the injured and the wounded.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old traditions and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by the Djihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Usbek and Tads.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there if the western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French credit, was well done.
The truck and tanker convoys overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more floods of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their insurrection from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was conquered because of the struggles of the various rebel groups of the war.
It was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obscurantism for the farmers dominated by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved to date.
Former Mudshaeddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by taking over government property to sell it as a building country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive U.S. subcontracting.
They were challenged, and most of them were not even involved in the fight.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country like those who could benefit from American donations: capital flight is considerable.
The young people have put down the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to obscuranism of the parties themselves or to corrupt certain executives will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed of mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represents a modern world, is seen everywhere.
An army is now present.
Will the authorities under whose command they are to stand be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralisation as an example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralised state out of it with a strong presidential violence.
President Karzai does not want to have any foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that has been targeted at war for 30 years, State control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan has vast land estimates.
This further reinforces the impression that the western countries were only on site to overcome it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper mill on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, it is not possible to build a mountain.
The Chinese have already left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary to re-establish normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys' and boys' Gymnasia, Institute for French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous unfavourable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mining villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to reach the impossible task of compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
These works, which were necessary for the numerous local workers, have helped to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land use.
What souvenirs do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much smaller budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard at a height of more than 2000 metres.
In the message, dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from the municipalities of the province of Kapisa have been received.
In order to free the farmers from the rebellion of foreign groups, which they wish to do in their own words, it would be necessary for them to continue to be less, well-controlled and directly assisted by the civilian concerned.
A Constitution with the breaking stand in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt has decided to place everything on a map in relation to the constitutional declaration that temporarily grants it the unlimited power, more than ever, it has decided to divide.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would be adopted on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Chief of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a preliminary, multiple-modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal cross-section.
This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "break his word" and "the right to walk".
On the side of its advocates it is ensured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to abandon their plans to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages across the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time show, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
Once the Egyptian people with this back-up are put to an extreme vote: " Either you agree to my draft or I retain the unlimited power," the latter should probably end after the constitution is adopted.
85 mostly Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a rare atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration, in mid-November, they withdrew because they felt that they had not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach the decision-making capacity, 11 alternate members were added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators also found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the hour of prayer, as some members of the board felt that the pendulum of the constitutional assembly was not enough.
The text that was adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and says that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more stringently.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Holiness" refers to the liberals who view this only as a propaganda attack.
Because according to them, Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In this regard, they have given particular attention to Article 220 of Al-Azhar University's advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia's laws.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rector of this university should be far less consistent than the current one.
"At the moment it is not a concrete religious commitment to recognize.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits, "that in relation to Article 220 there may be a plurality, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic Law, No. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as far as civil lawmakers are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is severely criticized for the extensive powers he gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence board.
Nor will there be any prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts as the associations have demanded to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears about the text they see as a threat to freedom.
The nature of the blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, there is no longer an article on the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Chief of State will march Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the world’s nabel and a sea from the sun
The Promised Land unites itself with the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unaffected nature.
The AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Abstaining From Sacred Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those who swim in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the turning of water into wine at a wedding feast, the going on water, the silence of the sea storm and the fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most temples, however, are located in Jerusalem.
Here believers do the route of suffering or crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the graveyard on Mount Golgotha, where there are the crossroads, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus.
It is here in the Christian view of the world’s navel, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend grew according to the tree from which the cross was made for the cross of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complainants, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave Zettel with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada constitute the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins from their own strength.
All others bring an airway to this historic summit.
The famous Hermon ski area is located in the north of the country from 1600 to 2040 metres above sea level, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, supposedly pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting Unique Museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
On only one trip, not all can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israeli Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in caves in the Jewish deserts and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the impressionists and expressionists of the coin, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir shops.
The entry is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most exciting section is the memorial for the children who were built to remember the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, complete darkness prevails.
The star's funk.
And they pronounce the names of the children of the Jews and of the countries in which they die.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main relief areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and Oceania.
Amazingly it is also bathed in the Red Sea in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is a whole year of bathing.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-sweetly on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribablely beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using salt water (natural salt) and heil sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and for the relaxation of strapasted nerves.
Touching the secrets of old age
These secrets provide the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route, the Egyptians, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to wander through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend of all those who touch the walls in the gas with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly mentioned couples from all over Israel and even other countries at phototerms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strip through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of the Roman statesman, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre features evening concerts and operas.
List of tourist attractions
If you are going to Israel, do not worry about your poor English knowledge: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the trip is not taken in euro, but in dollars that can easily be exchanged in shifts (current exchange rate: $1 to 3.8 shifts).
In the city you usually get ahead with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a motorway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the sub-city to the upper city.
It's just taken it's a underground stopway.
A trip within the city costs 6 switches regardless of the means of transport, which is sufficient to include a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be held in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is quiet.
And on Sunday morning the week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only delicious food is served, excluding pork, seafood, fish without sauces and food, which includes both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, fried balls made of purified beans and herbs (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no fighting dogs in the streets of the cities of Israel.
For this there are many well-fed cats who are comfortable and unsatisfied by the streets.
In the evening you even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to candy.
One car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance also costs $15 a day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 chips a day.
Access cards for museums cost on average 30 chips.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land, corresponding to an increase of 51% in 2010 compared to the period of comparison, before the lifting of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While Members and Citizens' Laws discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language testing for migrants, criminals already deal with false certificates
Each year 13 million guests come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families who stay at home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each migrant worker, had to pass a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing economy and in retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests are to become mandatory in the future for all guest workers.
This requires not only language testing, but also testing into Russian history and the principles of legislation.
Language knowledge must be demonstrated for both the preservation and extension of work permits.
Exceptions shall apply only to nationals of countries in which Russian is the official language.
It also excludes persons who received their training products and diplomas prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entire examination centre will be under the auspices of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass the tests in all cities; now more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the law came into force in the press, citizens asked the following question several times: What does the whole matter?
What changes does the rule require to present language knowledge, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
In particular, spokesmen of the Migration Authority are opposed to reducing the number of forced labour.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected against their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
There are problems for migrants without a profession, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language will encounter people with evil intentions who put him under the forefront of help into a dark, narrow Barakke, where he will spend dozens of months without food and documents and create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised a promise, and when you arrive you will be betrayed, received their passports and will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the head of the Labour Administration for Migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't jump, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they do not only control the language of the country of destination, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turks, Usbeks and Tads can only provide a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is no money yet to feed the children, but to keep quiet to buy them decent clothing, shoes and school stuff.
As teenagers, these children then seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language knowledge," they say.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' rights with regard to the law emphasize the following important aspect.
Only migrants with legal status must pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome to heart" or "No access to unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic zeal and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made fast and only for half a thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that most of our documents are fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of repression.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just don't look at the cost of wrong papers"
Already on the day that the law came into force, it became clear that not only the registration documents of migrants could be falsified.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been issued by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get this wrong: Every migrant who hoped to be able to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates can not be bought easily, both officials and citizens agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guests who fall through the test for the first time that they will receive time for a language course.
In addition, new entrants without language knowledge are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to step up the arms law for private arms owners.
In this way, the authorities respond to the latest events: injured in shooting at weddings and seven deaths during the massacre of Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and to set up the age of possession of weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Jarowaya, and promised that the amendments to the Duma Weapons Act would be tabled shortly.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, asking the authorities to remove the author - representatives of various arms associations - from "instinct affirmations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the internal ministry statistics, 142 crimes were committed using the registered weapons in six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an intensification of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
At present, according to the authors in Moscow, every possible weapon can be found for a small amount of money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons came across several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, says former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the struggles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel are illegal weapons stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegal weapons are from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a firefighting to conceal the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore handguns on the black market, such as in Moscow, are swindling," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggler.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes handcrafted production as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts calculated which proportion of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons come from the military and the law enforcement authorities, according to the investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there through the "debt of those responsible who have succeeded in their work with weapons", says the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant for a gun store that does not want to be mentioned specifically ensures that weapons found in illegal excavations are no longer bought since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get back into a stockpile.
A gun, for example a gun of type TT, is bought over a van.
The weapon is exposed and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police are aware of everything, of course, and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically purchases of control by dealers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often about acquaintances.
I had seen websites and blogs when someone paid attention to me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The prize for the weapon I only got there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To obtain a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and get used to a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you know that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even going to get a few rounds right now about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the beatings just because he knows I don't stab him.
Newers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schedules did not change according to him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was painted.
"I felt like a luxury shop," the military officer recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but he can try everything.
I buy not only as a potential customer but also go with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate," the expert describes the action.
Buying from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons "for various purposes" are offered.
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "Buy fighting guns or guns".
There users will submit your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Iwan" (verbal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," says the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service online.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in Siberia and can cook coal
Military commentator and former military associate Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also go out empty and come behind the grid when you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go up to the service online.
"People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and can create coal," he says.
A Macarow for 100 US dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, experts are expected to calculate prices of 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organisation "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Makarrow type gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to half a month.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps of medium ranges of spectators.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period January to October 2011, while the number of reported cases of theft and repression related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices dropped by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth American youth ever sits behind McDonald's box
In recent days there have been massive protests in the United States against low wages in Walmart's branches and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to be crushed or whether they will soon be reappeared.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several non-profit organisations on the left.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been professionally organized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handcuffs.
On that day some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and reached together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from winds over hunting weapons and auto batteries to dusty, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing fork stackers or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded salary increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the company's own health insurance amounted to $30 per month to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
These are about 1.1% more than they are now contributing for wages.
If Walmart would completely transfer the wage increases to the customers, each purchase would cost it only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be more than 12.39 dollars a year compared to today.
Walmart's advocates are satisfied that there were only nine states in protest and that they did not protect the company from any loss.
The Black Friday lasted in its shop from 8am on Thursday to midnight the next day, and Walmart sold about 5000 items per second during this period.
Overall, the Walmart cashiers performed almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the left-hand side of the Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees had laid down the work and the protest was only "another PR-trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's branches (which are not desirable in this advanced city and therefore not so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New York law at $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is increased gradually, however, not too strong, and on average, they get their simple employees in New York at 8.90 US dollars per hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it's possible to get out of New York with as little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the tea at McDonald's after school, but the young people were still living with their parents.
No one saw the main source of income or plant to stay there for longer.
Now I have interviews with McDonald's employees who constantly complain that they have to come out with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6.30 p.m. on Thursday morning before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and kitchens of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a double of the present minimum wage.
They continued to demand the training of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of companies from pursuing this goal and from withdrawing or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high level of staff flight.
Not satisfied
Sound protests were also held on this day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting on the afternoon before McDonald's at the Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support fast-food employees together so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. Fast Food Industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people in the area, of which not all are employed in the fast-food sector, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the radios of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be overlisted until now"
The theme of expanded reality, popular with adherents of modern technologies, has been observed in recent times for the most part by the lens of a special eye.
Google first presented a functioning model at its annual conference in summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a passing station.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with only hands and create virtual free spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are progressing, and today Xbox is no longer sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, to work on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment, is recognized.
Then we could add the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these haunted virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the ultimate solution because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around it about its actions and intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers is good, however, every one in its particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of managing objects in public places on a project where we experimented with short and short, instead of entertaining gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by an armband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could be theoretically reduced to the size of a bracelet.
Overall, however, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this spray dose?
They say it and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Is that what you want the user to adjust to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that allow us to capture reactions from people more precisely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are too little for gestures.
Stephen Betshees developed a contact sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a regulated delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly one device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared sensor and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system with which we could play with different camera trends to determine how this helps us to determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft presented his glasses to the public instead of Google.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the high hand on the way, but I think: the greatest variant would be an "changing" reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (private you can only see), but also their weaknesses, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a while that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: There is no sensitive reaction!
Hands feel nothing at all!
What are the answers your group wants to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the acute breakthrough could become the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual projection.
She's taking a great deal of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, creates the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays at a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently as weak as someone was pushing over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to list the brain?
Does it make you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will still have to fight, namely a person who is physically in a closed room to believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overlisted moderately, and many years of work are still ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality as attractive to a researcher: in many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to the city's inhabitants who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
Already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg Art Scene, whose achievements go beyond the city's borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bears you meet at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or on Vernissagen.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are also displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s or early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street he makes a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and provides them with good praise.
Recently he took a three-horn and became Petersburg's three-horn player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's design, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color Red as fashion designer, which is intertwined with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In society everything that deviates from the grainworm, aggression and bad behavior is called for.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old but not officially recognized painters came to an end at that time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which "Pushkinskaja 10" was born, and then it was only once.
I'm attracted to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to be at the centre of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Puschkinskaya 10, where there was a musical and artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play back, wore close t-shirts, and also belonged to the composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became from its Leningrad.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also has its origin in the art clinic.
Our employees and family guests went to Dorthin.
I am a hero of the past century, as culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press where it was about the award "The personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I got to the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
It is easy to be famous today, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognizable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make clear the currentness and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be that way.
In a clown, it's all gone and lost its tragic.
I love the Grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by providing that everyone has to put on a complete suit.
Now everyone pays attention to the dress and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man a hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
We've seen you recently in the role of the city's triangular player.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art be nice?
- Today commercial art must be careful, considerate and ridiculous.
We see the collapse of cultures.
Earlier the people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one another and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-Communitys, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- There are thousands of Stas Michailow shows!
- There are women left to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand come, so there is less management, money, and everything goes to the bottom.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to lie to them and not to destroy the achievements.
In my youth, I painted images of a collector who even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers have no culture at all, which is quite different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That's the culture I'm defending.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
It is said: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real breeds, because the breeds may not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts were needed.
In Moscow there are currently good advisers.
In Petersburg we have which experts could be, but they are blocked because there is a need for higher-ranking experts who properly assess the first and clear the way for them.
Now it only counts its own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they don't accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums.
What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable food floor.
Art can only grow hard on our rocks.
We need a cultural diet, for example, because we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
There's a lot less of this in us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in the World Hall
Earth in danger.
Earthquake or collapse with Killer Asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth’s inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, is the important question of how we can grow in gravity or on the planet of substitution?
I do not believe that there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"This is Mars and Venus," says the scientific employee of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are relatively life-friendly, on the surface of the Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible on a large scale or in the course of the Venus, that is, in all.
The question of reproduction in all was first discussed by the researchers regarding the flora.
Already half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the heirs raised in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the growth of insects, more precisely of small fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent to the worldall to investigate how the severity of the development of Embryos affects.
It develops a completely normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen must stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explains Professor Vladimir Sychew of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN.
Without solid ground, the kitchens were overrun wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely muted.
The kitchens did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let the kitchen slip and then put the whole thing in because it's just impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew says to the wrong experiment with the kitchens at all.
The last cub with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only similar species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized into everything.
In principle, nothing was found.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research has to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the space Councils grew up.
The problem of reproduction could not be solved directly in space until now.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are cut out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive course.
Unlike animals, humans could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying all over the world for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereskowa.
The most valuable thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our mowes flew from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it exceed the space flight?
Will they be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"At last no one answered this question," says Space Veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereskova, was born to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrjan Nikolayev, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy.
"The more dangerous it is, the more dangerous it is even for flights to the Orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator in the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the preparation of the flight.
Here in a wet state, the cosmonauts win routines for work in the open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adult water feels pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's like the little Ichtyander testimony to the fact that life in the land came to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the fertile water, and that it can then be more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since the birth to the first swimming is just 2 weeks away.
"It's too little time to forget something," says Baby Swimming Teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and hip muscles return enormously quickly and thus also decreases the ability to express the child.
Well, let's take care of the birth control.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to express the child.
"But what happens then?" says the non-significant question by Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the formation of the Earth, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in the orbit like an adult for training in a load pull.
He will simply miss what is essential to his life.
"This experiment that we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring an disabled, totally inappropriate person into the world," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in all the world is just a theory.
But sometimes it will be reality when the earth’s inhabitants break up into their spaceships into a distant planet that will be home to their all-born offspring.
NKÜ-Chief: Control of the Black System is lost due to policy failures
However, in the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but its application falls back.
In the discussion for Aktuální.cz says dies der Vice-President des Höhsten Controlamte (NKU) Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be properly applied - and this is not the case in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative example of practice, he introduces Prime Minister Petr Nečas's attitude to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"However, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come from the president of the government, and the control office whose duty is once to control compliance with the law, hinders its operation," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee of the Chamber, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of the two countries on public procurement were compared.
What was it about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, it is because European legislation determines how public contracts are to be handled. It builds up national legislation, and finally there is still the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have been able to find very interesting differences. In general, the laws may be even more "hard and perfect" with us, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to re-establish new and more precise rules. It is also necessary to take care of the actual application of the law.
How can the project be a help to you? What comes out of this project?
It is precisely such joint control that we should stop constantly trying to improve the laws and reduce and reduce thresholds if this is not obviously particularly positive.
Economics means to acquire a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude illegal prosecution or even criminal action.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Maybe it's even so that we only charge the system in this way with excessive "paper scrap" and those who are looking for holes in the system are much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remain higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German Pendant for the NKU of the Federal Court of Auditors, which has a similar structure as we do and also has a college that is only being formed something different, but in principle both authorities are similar.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that there are these accounting courts also in the individual federal countries - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are under the control of the Land Courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would like to compare this without specific details only to Hungary. However, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better at all.
Does this suggest that the examiners are better there?
That is not true, but as it is said: I do not like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have had anything to do with our authority, would they?
With regard to the Czech legislation, which was important to your authority for the renewal of the award law, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this novelle is only in force for a short time, it has not yet worked in our tests.
Since our checks are carried out subsequently, we have to calculate a certain delay here.
We have so far experienced effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of Risks of Inequality" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally affect itself, as the thresholds changed, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or is the system being charged with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "hard" and can no longer be observed.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination against the carrier (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are therefore obliged to account for any non-compliance with the award law with respect to budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to make the law even more stringent?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have made a mistake that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let's say which way is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not satisfy the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Black System" - what exactly is that?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government and the control office whose duty is once to control compliance with the law must interfere with its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do it as if there was nothing.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain procedures - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the offerer is excluded with the best offer only because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is lacking.
On the streets alone ice creams are common, but mostly they are dry.
In part there are snow and ice sheets on the Czech streets.
However, mainly the roads are well maintained, with increased caution being offered.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the Karlsbad district, the streets were well maintained this morning, united by dominant snow and ice.
The temperatures drop to -5 to -10 °C, it should get warmer over the day.
It is no longer cut in the region, and in the deeper altitudes there is only a thin snow cover.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the slopes of the Erzberg.
According to the District Street Guard, there was a limited view due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the roads of the first road class in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is given, for example, to bridges on which the trains are required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third classes of roads, including mountain roads, are accessible.
On these roads, however, cut-off cuttings are required or used.
In particular, increased attention is therefore offered in the higher levels.
District of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is a danger of icebergs, higher levels and in the mountains there is still an out-of-the-way snow level on the roads, and the road and motorway direction is shared on their websites.
The road champions warn drivers of icebergs that can occur especially in higher positions in the Pardubice area.
In particular, it can be found on the roads of the second and third classes of roads in the districts of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitaviy and Vysoké Myto.
Streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are treated chemically.
Snow is especially located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlicé Mountains.
An out-of-date snow cover is located on the streets of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or hotter today, and it remains largely unbeatable.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in the Pilsen district are well maintained today, but increased attention is offered locally, and the road is to be adapted to the weather.
This is cool in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it cut before and the temperatures fell afterwards, it can come to ice level on the streets.
In addition, it is also possible to count with fog, but it will improve in the course of the day.
These figures are from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is virtually unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by road masters between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The first-class roads are mostly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of the Pilsen and Tachov districts, it can be cut to ice level.
The tracks of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore the reference here also applies to possible required sections.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Bezirk Olomouc
With snowmatch today, drivers must count towards altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of jet vehicles, the snowman stays on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night-time snowflake forced the road champions to use, according to data from the road management about 3 cm Neuschnee.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the Schumperk district, there are still snowfalls.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers must count towards Jeseník with snow", said a road manager Šumperk today against the agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to their information, the roads are free to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are unrestricted, but in the Šternberk district, drivers must drive carefully in forest sections as the roads are still wet.
Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In northern Bohemia, road champions report just as many bad sections of roads.
In addition to several places with snow or ice level, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to traffic police data.
The temperatures remain below zero, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets. From the depths, especially south-east of the Bohemian Central Mountain, no problems have been reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have yet been reported.
Ice cream is reported in particular from the area of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - day over rain and melting snow, night over cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported by the main routes and by road I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary because of the axles which were pushed from the snow elastus to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of the world's decline?
This is one of those catastrophic messages that we would like people to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap we are more fun about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world’s decline.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the World Cup.
Can you present the project closer to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is projected for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will take place at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert is about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, located in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's the source of this idea?
Originally well from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world from going down, but we also want to reflect, together with the public, on the condition in which we give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key attachments against the world's decline, with their purchases via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap also included the so-called Hymne against the world's decline with the title "world's decline" along with other interpreters.
Already today, the Hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also be declared on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and quite finally, provided that everything fits and the world is not going to end...
The hymn is to be sung at the same time by all the performers on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymens will be transmitted live together in a direct switch from the Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperate with both of you?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the fact that we carry out many beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most of us are interested in and have fun.
What is the purpose of the release of the concerts against the world's decline?
For the establishment of the free education centre Studio, where we have been working with the Association Tap at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly attended by lecturers who assist them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building is to be built in which we will then take part with this project.
Several groups and interpreters appear at each concert.
What criteria have you chosen for this?
We wanted to put together a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrators with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
For more information, see www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May, for the first time at Prague Spring, we also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to take part in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States then - would also like to connect this with events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group that consists of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. We also have to bring a lot of tool bags and other bags...
Nevertheless, it has always been without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that sometimes I have already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in individual countries with freedom of movement, how to deal with disabled people etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual when someone in the wheelchair is alone in the city centre.
It is not even true that there is a wheelchair in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to pick up against the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things that we hang behind...
However, it should be noted that improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not uncommon for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect for the public and freedom of the public is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to set up a band?
At that time, I started as a nurse at the Jedlikka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and I play saxophone, I have founded a music-AG with a colleague.
Well, and in time, it's like our moderator, Ládja Angelovic, is being cared for, something out of control (laughing).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also begun to actively advertise for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not to be seen outside, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good readers, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to deal with things differently.
In the show business today often copies each other.
This is logical in its way, since everything new is viewed with caution and is accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; it is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not alone and abandoned beings that we should regret.
There are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not just progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also seek some discipline.
This is, in my opinion, quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week to try to complete the preparation stages and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm gets in the way of many.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, that is, since 1998?
Only one single: Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Held on the day before the world's predicted arrival, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
Events are: Incheba Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are connected to the end by live switch and the band The Tap Tap explains a common interpretation of the Hymne "The World's Fall off".
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: CZK 25 million
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age for free, cards are available for pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was included at a ministerial meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organisation ESA as the twentieth member of this Space Authority. Poland is thus the second member of the former East Block (according to the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland into space began freely much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos spiritists dealt with space travel, which did not always make sense.
For example, I recall here A. Šternfeld's lecture of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Intang into Cosmonautik".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the "Intang into Cosmonautics" Prize in 1934, founded by Robert Esnault-Phelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books about these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters was named after him on the earthly side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a railway Drisin was built in Poland for which a rocket was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rockets should be used to start or brake the Draisine.
This information can only be obtained from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-driven missiles.
The research work was conducted by the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It is evident from the documents submitted that the research has been carried out until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted freely by the march of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press, the design of a photo-electric hunting kit by Ing. Rohozinski appeared, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda povietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the start of the war.
Further articles on space travel were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polish Towarzystó Astronautique) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, where four extensive articles of space travel are devoted.
Prof. M. Subotwicz's article contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time there were already the first satellite projects, and it was to be expected that research in space would have a future.
In its early years in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Space Federation established in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in the fall of 1956.
The following year he was the first PTA President, Kazimierj Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-President of the International Federation for Space Transport.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA has been involved in the development of the most successful meteorological missiles (Rakieta Meteorologicnza), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in 1959 started in the Błędów Desert Flight Tests with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development level should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to monitor altitudes.
In 1962, however, further development was put in place.
Following the first RM-type rockets, the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rockets have been developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B above 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C above 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km at all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland participated in the intercosmos programme also in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became a second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Unusual Works is no solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court raised the law on non-profit works.
This decision called for a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is why the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with endless financial speculation.
Due to the great difference in the value of work (wages) it comes to price tensions.
In this sense, it is understood that the manufacturer is trying to make imports of cheap goods into economic competition by "subcontracting" the competition in order to generate a greater share of the market and increase its profits.
To a large extent, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy it cheaply, or to give up their business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital is not a social responsibility and thus does not bear any responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that employers are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to compensate for the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The unbiased practice of private capital creates in individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population regardless of the social consequences to private capital.
This is particularly true of amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the private sector to accept the dictatorship of private capital in particular in the area of wages.
This is done by means of economic pressure on long-term unemployment, by means of the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food supplies for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work for several years.
The number of people involved is already going to millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state must raise its income to the minimum.
Such a scandal was also detected in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures of virtually all EU countries will undoubtedly go out to the same state in which people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a catastrophic disturbance to their social level (as in the 19th century) or to work for a wage on the edge of society and to hope that private investment will ever flow to the country.
Of course, here the question arises where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only moves from one country to another; or capital remains exactly the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees are working for a fraction of European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state cannot take part in its own economy with capital, and that economics leads to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital is strictly dependent on its position that the State must not interfere with the economy.
But then we have to ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence politics and thus influence the entire state in its own selfish sense or even influence it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a practically powerful and omnipotent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual benefit, legislation in which virtually everything is appropriate, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry does not have any private finance, close to industry-led law firms with the drafting of draft laws.
These draft laws will then be adopted on the Bundestag.
All violence will then no longer come from the people, as the Western constitutions announce, but from strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation, as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been understood in the fall, and the officials have been occupied with violence.
Against butter money, by unlawful deduction of benefits or by stone and sword.
The corruption was unhindered, and the people went with already purchased votes for election" ... "People with character do not complain for officials, so that the state had no consulate for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "I really started to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ... Appian was thinking of Pompeius, but then the strong man was Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today’s society is based on the unprecedented preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to all social interests.
Private capital is no longer capable of recognizing and implementing the benefit of the whole society from its nature.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decade of elites who do not in the least strive for deeper reforms.
We must therefore seek the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the unprecedented liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the decline of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already being drawn.
In particular, disaster is the fact that today's elites are facing the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes of which we are witnesses today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, in total ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the State's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the position of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Labour of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain reads: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there is no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, an abundance of reactions.
Those who stand behind Israel and argue with their right to self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide perpetrated by the Palestinian Arabs and call the State Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write in this place about who is guilty of the repeated waves of death and who is the victim; finally, the people of Israel today, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence themselves.
I want to open the reader's eyes behind the scenes to see who are the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always these personalities who determined their steps autonomously, or whether someone behind their throne was leading their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power derived from it has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a special emphasis that could be described as the head of the kid (I don't know if anyone is standing over them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Many are not written about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century in order to stop the connection of their name to high-criminal acts, in whose background there was always the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all of the world's central banks, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or take up arms against them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after which the Ghaddafis storm remained only four, while Russia had signed its central bank of the Russian government in the meantime).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (public) bank notes during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own bank notes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Senator Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to report the FED for the outbreak of the global economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of the Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan for the establishment of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemaur of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of recognition.
The first war aimed at eliminating the great monarchy of Europe, the second war should in particular break the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war should reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their conveniences and luxury and would also not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism here is nothing more than the pretext) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families work with the Rothschilds at the top is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that crises like those triggered by them in 1907 do not happen again).
After they were succeeded by the murder of the Habsburg Thronfoliger Ferdinand in Sarajevo to launch the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unwarranted capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the bankers were able to create a latent conflict situation through politics by putting Germany on huge war repairs, creating the preconditions for poor masses, so that they had to undermine the Germans only a strong enough leader to offer the guilty and easy solutions; another factor was the creation of the world-wide Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should take up the function of a fifth column and also take up the warfire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish State, as much as possible in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first meeting with the Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was released from the chain where the international bankers had kept him at first, or whether everything was planned, it is only difficult to estimate, at any rate, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the calling of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers are able to combat this war, the Jewish people will be like the victims of the Second World War in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (one thinks only of how people are strongly divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice is only triggered by injustice in an endless spiral of violence, while at the beginning the envy of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, like us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-based politician who is loyal to international banks, who is doing all he can to wage war against Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand into a global conflict, and in which Iran's control over the 2-mile wide road of Hormus, which could lead to a destruction of the world economy by 20% of global oil supplies.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In her vision, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serve a small group of financialists.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the big ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give a sign on their right hand or on their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because it has the sign, namely the name of the animal or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom! who hath understanding, who hath more than the number of the beasts.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of protesting Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the release of the corrupt Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronate over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the chess overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not able to carry out the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the calling of the United States, and the subsequent failure in the violent attempt to free hostages only made it even worse.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days of negotiations by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that protected the United States a small victory.
Immediately before the message was received, six messengers fled.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran; it helped them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited in the country of Trehorte for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywoods.
In order to make the drawing credible, articles on this film project were published in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On one side he is a realistic politician, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housepiece such as the movie Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the levels of mood change in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passes from Hollywood, which are ironically and easily oversawed.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in attendance at the discussion table, on the official flyers, on the phone...
With this film Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable relaunch of his career.
He has become a respected director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after Crimea No children's play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Affleck that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the local atmosphere was part of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the introductory sequence of the destruction of the message is very impressive in its transparency, and yet it conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team also in fictional scenes (the false filmboard on a bassar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to agree that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is removed from a phone call in America, or even the chase on the highway, seem to be somewhat artificial).
Argo's weakness is his all too wide affluence, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Afflex's film thus loses some of its power. It is a film that can be followed with some interest, and in doing so, it will be able to go through the design and the retro-style that is remembered by a thriller from the 1970s.
However, he only wakes up with enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a certain living piece of history to this day, and as evidence of how the ideas of the almighty and all-knowing secret services were passed on, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing air balloons, bananas and circuses
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls for an annual survey on the most absurd bank fees, decided to organise the competition "Absolute Regulation or the idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea led us to introduce a 40% women's share of the management of large European companies recently presented by the EU," said Patrick Naker, who is responsible for the organization of this survey, compared to the Právo newspaper.
For example, the European Court of Justice's judgment on the harmonisation of the insurance tariffs for men and women is one of the cited absurdities.
Until then, women enjoy a benefit in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible revenue from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013", Naker told.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the mandatory mixing of bioethanol into fuels which are naturally harmful, the further ban of the reliable mercury thermometer only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, because of which eggs have become significantly more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also raised the actual ban on the use of the term "butterstrike" or the prohibition on the sale of conventional vertebrates.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (the Czech Republic, for example, is currently attempting to implement the claims of the Czech banks with veto-breeding).
Lobby interests also suggested that bananas of the highest class of trade in the EU should be at least 14 cm long and should not have "frequent anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonises the uniform national standards that would impede trade.
The EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already been highlighted by some countries against resistance, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food loss.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation of last year, which according to balloons must be provided for sale with the indication that children under eight years of age may not blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU took part in an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction is already applicable for children under 14 years of age when using year-market fluctuations.
Curious revenue is also available at home
It is also quite absurd that a directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone who assumes an official role in the EU should not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and should instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of Liberal Economics Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU Regulation on the extent of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus set the ceiling on food preparations that could be found on the day of our EU accession to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the fixed volume for mushrooms, which threatened us with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were freely not from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged because we do not have a sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereals were very high and the state stocks were overloaded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Palace.
Finally, the European Commission opposed the Czech Republic to the extent that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding has been offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), which should specifically be the means for setting up funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
However, regulations in the Member States are easily targeted at criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve greater recognition, in the opinion of some experts.
A serious problem is, in the opinion of these experts, the EU funds for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced into individual Member States' budgetary negotiations.
Emotions also call for the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomucké trážky", the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The name Rum shall only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
The official list of EU-registered products now includes the Karlsbader Zwieback, Pohorëlice Karpfen and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hoppen, the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipan or the Parschinken.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer chefs or the Horicer rollers can breast-feed.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura says.
Mr Senator, how do you come to the idea of running for the President's office?
I'm not talking about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country would work out without problems, I would never run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plowed for 20 years, how thieves go freely, while people are raised taxes and age.
I didn't have ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am over 40 years old, and I have no choice but to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you did it and then immediately made yourself on the way to the castle.
So don't you turn your voters back?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would run for the President's office if I were elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that as a people in the cage and in front of the TV, but that everyone who wants to make a change.
To this end, the media who want to rob one of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
About me, for example, was claimed that I would become a journalist or that I was a advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle has been recorded with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective statements of assets over 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have used myself to keep the tour guide free of charge, and this could be implemented.
The problem is small-scale policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and this only stops the population.
As an independent partner, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without any crowding out of any party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
For me, this right-left thought is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we continue.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or the right warehouse; I want to connect the people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSCHM or from the ODS, and I will also turn to bad ideas.
You don't like it if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to get closer to.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the suggestions I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you only have words to say.
And so you don't get far into politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people for a long time, you will succeed, for example, in carrying out the material and criminal liability?
I don't have another option.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the presidents of Parliament's parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then the defendants should say, "Why do they deny this?"
A strong personality that points to faults can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public printing.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just started with politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work out, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czechs.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone have nothing; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities about whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jancúra, who refused because of overwork.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who discovered the fraud in trade with light heating oil.
My candidacy started with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Do you think about the establishment of your own party?
I have not thought about it yet because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, and even have no money for it.
I don't even have any money for the presidential campaign; only 20,000 CZK are in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you feel?
My private assets are estimated at CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a Škodu Superb worth about a million, and then I still have a few million in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always felt like he was driving in the car, gallant to women and at the same time fighting evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a 60 million property and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest in your own money.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some debts?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't get too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to fight the campaign by my own means.
The costs for the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on my own from the senator's content; for example, I couldn't finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you'd be returning these activities?
But this does not depend on the amount of the payment.
As promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, my representative in the spring will be the manager of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still how it is.
However, as President, I would like to set up my own businesses.
You will find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - for example, the spikes and the most recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big company, thinks, "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a bookstore today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's volunteering in one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenten, a barely needed sleeping town in front of the Tower of Rotterdam, is a bookkeeper.
The 80,000 population community is the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this foolish situation, it was decided to contribute to general education a few years ago and to build up the seven fictitious bridges represented on euro coins as well-painted steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city's fathers recognized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library had to be here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, master of the magnificent barbaric diagrams and producer of funny, yes often cynic buildings, took the matter with usual courtesy and appeared to the competition earring in 2003 with five books under his arm and a border in his face.
And while the jury was still tired of looking around and nibbling with the axes, the angry Maas piled up his read-up of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionist underwalled speech with the words: "Dear City Community!"
So this is my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenzenes, for the so-called Bökkenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euros expensive mountain was shot down.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and rowing houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small city resorts, which so far had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unimaginable hideous hall, behind which white facades would be inclined to assume a dairy factory in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijken now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheeses.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, but the true joys of space and reading come from walking up the topography.
The glassed interior is bright and transparent, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street faucets inevitably speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at parkbanks, dogs and football boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"There are normally book rules along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space, which is most uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on our head and hung the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used nicely: Offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and house engineering centres are located in the center.
A special pleasure are the black book rules, which are sometimes wall decoration, sometimes kissing, sometimes climbing countries.
Optics, hypnotics, and smell are strange.
Even embedded architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the City Municipality of Spijkenzen, at the request of the standard.
And so we have been hit in a farm in Frisian one day on an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre of plastic has been used in growing houses and in fields as a source.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it is ripe for the bulkhead.
For the library, the vlies - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, load-resistant material that smells a bit after a new car and a bit after a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long hike, the literature café is rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and planted fig trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in the literature mountain.
Donations of cash with the condition that it can be returned if needed by the donor.
"You wouldn't believe it, but in spite of the many glass surfaces, this house is a preview project in point ecology," says Trouborst.
Heat and cooled with earth's heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass crash, the sun appears only briefly inside on sunny days.
The broad wooden beams, which cross the glass facade, serve as an estimate and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Do the rest of the full automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the first skeptic of the IT industry, was already waiting for the way into the new library.
Lisette Hehaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Boekenberg even as a "longer overcrowded soul".
The reason: To open up a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to contribute a book from his personal stock.
This is the first time the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The regulars are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-dollar library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, everyone now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And when it's only on earth.
The MVRDV has thus succeeded in the Royal Discipline, which is called in the Fachjargon Identity Foundation.
Spykenten wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated she likes to be.
This is finally a point of approach for identity.
Szabo: "German must play a larger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine to the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on European relations, Berlin thus balances on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin was born.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of its special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote when it came to establishing an air-ban zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
It is regrettable that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are standing between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they were still trying to play their part, but they are on the way to a "normaler" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows willingness to refer to positions of national interest that are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one thing, Germany has large paragraph markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to stumble the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
That plays a role anyway.
But I would also not like to lose too much weight, which is not a completely unilateral relationship.
But at least it plays an important role in German discussions.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions of the vote, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even play a certain role in this.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly expressed itself for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Government under Obama has a considerable understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and instead have to drive things out of their own position.
They're just doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Is Germany itself in the role of an important international player - will Germany take on a major role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Thus Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be sensitive to different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the U.S. influence in European policy is constantly declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant for them and makes them a lot more unloved - c'est la vii!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, where academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly explore the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Market protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is also a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
After that, a fully officially registered name in China is hidden, however, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Yet she enjoys protection as long as the real nominees do not complain.
And even then it is not clear if they are given the right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Taylor Wessing Office, who specializes in violations of protection rights in Fernost.
Every week, there's a new case on my desk.
The successor already has a few additional letters so that they can register their brands.
In this way, from Gucci, Lu-Gucci will be easy to enter, instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports products manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with trademark entries in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company there protected the brand Zigna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zigna.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in the damaged spiritual property.
In the big cities there are multi-story shopping houses that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: on behalf of his clients, he assumes that Chinese companies from the brand office have the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a leading brand.
The word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
So women are meant to be rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"It's business-damaged, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The brand is watered, the setting disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to millions, especially in the case of expensive forecast products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market of 15 billion euros in the year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go to money.
Up to nine years the procedure can be withdrawn, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected the complaint because after the long term the claimed name has become "marctreality".
If the plaintiff has Pech, he has to pay the plagiarism even because he injured his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star to this day.
The Volvo Buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was broken, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against Hong Kong and Singapore descendants, who left the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The brand name CTMO in Beijing, however, adds that there were difficulties in 2010 due to too little staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, one was returned to normal from the "notice situation in the course of work".
As a result, the existence of unprocessed opposition proceedings was reduced by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 objections to execution are still pending in the office.
To approach it costs a lot
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China is taking the list of new notifications worldwide for the tenth time, the authorities are sharing.
This also applies to the existence of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan was charged.
Simply put, this means that each application costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros on average.
On the other hand, a multiple cost, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to reach the point where their illicit manufacture of simulated parts of motor vehicles was lifted.
However, the successor continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
You yourself have missed this because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wenzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand name CTMO shows the opposition of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opposition continues to fight.
You need to be careful.
Now the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be identified, the firm archive has even had to review hundreds of years of old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "high six-point euro" for settlement.
"Then you can see how much this is worth to us," Wenzler says.
The dangers in Fernost threaten even to jump back to Europe.
That's when the impersonators are safe there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has been abandoned by the Group for a long time, yet it was able to withdraw the registration.
"You have to watch out for yourself," says Wenzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "all that is of some value in terms of protection, even in China", as Wenzler says.
Otherwise, it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg is subject to his last act of brand drama, then it is likely that the reverse would have to pay license fees for his own name, Wenzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the Question segment.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS whales are excited about this.
The history of a connection that exceeds far more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and gentlemen's fans are looking for the pace on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then will the voices of the singers slow down - Alt, Bass, Tenor and Soprano - push, touch and chase.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, is almost out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his filthy wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, at the music centre of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi will try a new song.
Fifty singers and singers, between the ages of 23 and 69, came from the human geneticist to the house man.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir has a different text and this one also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
Around the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected people, who estimate Unidas, the United Nations AIDS Programme.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 Aidwaisen live.
More than 40 percent of the population are currently HIV positive.
For 180 AIDSWais in the village of Esitni, the Association of Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school form and a hot meal every day in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means Zulu historians or also praisers.
The Bantu language can speak fluently, no one in this room can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign language and brings them back and forth to where they originally came from: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg Airport, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitni, which depends on the voice force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple leech and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are exposed to the HI virus.
In Esitni, there is evidence of what the whole of Swaziland is ill: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Men's frontal cuts, which prove to reduce the risk of inflammation by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, with 30 percent dying in the middle is not rare.
On a joint African trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who were not only lacking parental care, but only on everything: food, clothing, education.
You don't have a chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a couple of euros a year to school and allow him a warm meal on the day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has been taking care of the AIDS waves in Esitni since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI includes syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filsage and scratches are part of the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults Chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (pilz), tripper and human papillomavir are often sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in these countries - yet around 20 percent of HIV infections fall into this group.
In adolescents, Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
After European surveys three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomavir is common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
The number of syphilis infections increased from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause joints in the genital area, urination, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or herbs.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of inflammation, but do not offer 100 percent protection.
For in part, ruminants of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infections of the kidneys and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts recommend regular studies especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis of most STI may be healed and delayed.
Through patents, donations, and not least the gags that the chorus reaches throughout Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitnie," says Annette Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the village Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and implementing woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care of the well-being of the cows, for example in one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 cows, give them a roof over their head and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time every day for school.
Anyone who has no one else comes to Khanyisile's shelter, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two kitchens that cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a nesting school, built two chicken houses, and organized the PSI together with the American Health Organization, that many people in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because so obviously the disease is also throughout the country, but it is the most popular thing to do.
A King With 14 Wifes
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Let's say instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels every two, three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of warmth, spirit of struggle, trust and black self-consciousness, which many know at the southern tip of the Black continent even from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings excitement and joy, but has already taken off some angry border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitni, where the singers visit their paternity children.
Even if you hardly find the small village on land maps, it is more known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitni, there's the light" people say there.
And if you go back to Heidelberg at 8733 kilometers of airport, to the springing singers in the testing room on the Bergheim Street, then you can see there too.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is next to the sun, there are also frozen water there, as from three studies published in the "Science" magazine on Thursday.
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the planet’s shadowed region.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps even asteroids that are hit by Mercury.
No one brings the Ice Fund in connection with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger's Sun, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have been reached in other areas of the solar system.
Not noticed are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the world.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: Small holes in infinite lengths.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Ceres twin planets.
Like Pluto, which runs behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is not a "Planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This video cut of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, to be more difficult to identify are the pink "newborn" in the star circle room.
This star-shaped region - called Unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star-image Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering glute of a dying star has captured the tipzer telescope of the nasa.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that exudes the star in the process of death.
In the huge trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The peak telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the Galactic Stube.
The Pleiade starry, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the only eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks at this infrared photo opposite the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity to an earthly continent brought this fog to the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photos ensures spectacular coloring.
This babyster could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the tipzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As these were created, it is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and strongest recordings of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Guard shows the protection of trifid fog in the constellation of stars over thousands of light years.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, divided), as dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
Astronomers in the star image have photographed the presuppositions of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years away from the earth breed the cores of two melting galaxies and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star-birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not have technical abbreviations, which may be referred to as the Southern Firewheel at its peak.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an cut from the Irisnebel in the star image of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year fog consists of dust grains, which are between ten and a hundred times smaller than normal household dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for the NASA.
The largest spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way.
The star wave always produces new youngsters.
Also, these star clouds, connected to the Rosetten fog, produce new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers assume that he was only born shortly after the urn when it was found essential hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into everything: The most important telescopes
The telescope was designed by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - just before Galileo Galileo used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrores of the optical telescopes have been increasingly larger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest remote tube.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., is the large Binocular telescope.
It allows you to look into all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Grand Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - the only mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of cheap construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height corner.
Its speciality: the high power of light.
This is enough - despite a relatively small mirror diameter - to the largest mirror telescope in the world.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear everything after alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing computing.
Look at the European Star Guard Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here lies the Very Large Telescope - which makes all the glory to his name.
With a total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the central infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is about 42 meters long - and consists of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, with images it is possible to calculate at the earliest 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes were considered the largest in the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
They offer two mirrors at the same time with an average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is also seen in the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from all provide the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it has already delivered images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extra-solar planets - mainly for those who are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, it was announced by the NASA that 1235 planetary candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the last initial preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket in early 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies to the urn.
Scientists assume that the South Pole of Mercury also exists.
However, there is no reliable data for this, since the messenger is approaching the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
The Messenger's probe launched in 2004 - the first to cross the Mercury - has now been confirmed by scientists.
Drinking butter daily - and become 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talyse mountain is called wild-mantic.
The small bus rushes across the curved road, past densely forested hills, flowing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian group of the Thais live, from which they are not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very long-lived.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town boasts too massive architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours because the road is just rough.
The so-called wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the proof of tourist attraction.
"Baku was celebrated in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum for Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the life of about eight dozen Taliban from the area is documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
A child born 136 years of age
However, the controversial star of the museum is the Schafhirte Şarali Müslümov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who became 122 years old, Mujslümov's age appears to be extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died", explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he was to have another daughter.
So did Şarali Müslümov count for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been one of the top players in Central Asia.
"As a result, there are also many tally people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia there are very many very old men".
However, due to the lack of documents, there should be no scientific evidence of age, especially in the absence of a personal status register.
Every day safely melted butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why are there so many high-ends here in the south?
The Asian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Taliban.
On the other hand, museum director Fatulayeva believes that it lies at the food.
But that calculated the calorie-rich cost of the Thais should be so healthy, the meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, from a nutritional point of view, is not even quite plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengeriran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a buttock that she untraces and rolls.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are grandparents for a long time.
Two little kids are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical, abdominal-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfect in row and limb, under her head she hides long, dark-blown fingers, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always only eaten what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
For the rest of my life, I haven't bought a single food in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the time after World War II.
But everything got better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
Propaganda rarely sounds out of the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, which ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows the borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, later taken over by his son Ilham.
However, there is no need under Azerbaijan's Alten.
230 Manat (e.g. the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for domestic conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-green son is also right: "The old enjoy our culture's high regard."
They live in the middle of the Big Family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing broadcasts in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as the basis is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian President did not spare Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he may succeed is in my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secularists.
Because they are all, so far hopelessly defeated in a confused opposition, afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of the graces of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He has, as Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologizing, temporarily cut the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who wears a doctorate at the American University of South California really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are themselves, is not quite clear.
Whether to disable the prompt
In fact, the 234 articles, which were inspired by the Islamic-dominated 100-headed constitutional assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforceritt, are partly of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in the draft that the caselaw is based on the "Principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is an interpretation matter and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the slender formulation and the resulting legal space for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This adds at least one new article to be added: In all the matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University had to be drawn up, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiation power throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it can mean that spirituality oversees the legislation, which would in fact result in the release of the judgments.
Much in the draft Constitution is an interpretation
Also problematic: civil justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the dictator's collapse, up to 11,000 civilians sat in military.
The State should also, as the draft says, "the true beings of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morals and values".
This is so legally formulated that state institutions with the help of this article could even control the content of film art and literature.
In the text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article expressly determines the equality between men and women.
For this is forbidden another Prophet, Muhammad, and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be treated remains unclear.
Likewise dubios encourages the formulation that the "disgusting of people" has been prohibited.
Is there enough of the President's cartoon or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
As in the draft, the Mursi is present for signature and, according to him, the Egyptians will be presented for referendum "very soon".
"The Revolution is back"
The opposition has been forming against the overwhelming power of the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual event on Friday at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the charter before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-party presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the draft constitution belongs to "the Müllberg of History".
Through short news service Twitter he visited the followers of Mursis to want to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crush him," said opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet healthy," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood, on the other hand, remained on the countertest, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile before Cairo University.
Many veiled women and adherents of the Salafists took part in it and cried out: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They demanded from Mursi: "The land is clean," and they said: "The Qur'an is ours."
A struggle around the empire over the symbolic Tahrir square, on which all its beginnings took place, would probably have undermined civil war conditions.
The Mursis supporters obviously did not want to risk it.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the election which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and involve all the social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslims when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
For this he was tried, condemned, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complained in the discussion with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three abusers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are an increasing violation of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto puts it out of power," said Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda is left alone, also from the international community, who sees the ideological struggle at the river with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could suck.
A protestant on Tahrir warns: "You give a monster you can't control anymore."
Rackfish from Norway: Is this the world's most ominous fish?
The five million Norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite on pretty bad fish?
You take a selection of overfished cheese varieties.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, moist sportswear.
And hold her there for a week.
So close to this, you have to imagine the nascent smell of rakfish, one of Norway's great delicacy.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this harsh smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-flavoured forelets that - depending on how you would have liked to smell its fish - are fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians stream to a party here in the fields, which, now, is dedicated to this really very interesting speciality.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but as so-called "Rakfisk General" also hosts the festival.
Around us people consume small fishworms and take large amounts of alcohol.
"People like the aquarium more than the fish," says Havard.
The spirit can suppress the smell.
I'll take some hippies.
If you avoid bringing the fish close to you, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a much different, much poorer Norwegian epoch, when there were no cooling options yet and fish was drunk in the autumn in airproof salt water vessels.
In the deepest winter, he was then removed after long fermentation and, no doubt with the help of alcohol, was consumed.
Even before one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and mainly moved to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, Angelized by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not far richer than Norway long ago, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important - as an essential, even strictly enriching part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by the name - the racist rights extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "event of 22 July".
Norway is making it difficult to accept that someone in its peaceful country is capable of such brutal killings.
The largest oil and gas industries in the world have been responsible for the present wealth of Norway since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our basement, who distributes round tablets with mature raffial fish and with her long blonde hair and the dazzling blue eyes, the Nordic ideal is embedded.
We are a - as you say - prudent people.
Her English is just like most people here are useless.
We're not very polite, we don't like laundry.
Norway has been very careful about its oil supply - a large part of the sector's output is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone was throwing money around which they did not even own, Norway firmly closed its stock exchange.
"If we can ride in the winter ski and walk in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And of course eat rakfish," she adds with unbearable laughter.
I'm in the snow and I'm going to stand for another court - from Rakfisk I've had enough.
Such an elch-cigarette is, at least, something else.
But in the evening the steak fish is back on the food plan.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a fish dinner, can vote for the guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging sense of smell - fish.
There is a live TV switch to a fly-adjusted showmaster surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number of points do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You laugh and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict sound of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his appointment, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Current traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-closed city, but on Monday a steel ring was built, which shuts several important traffic routes into the capital and ensures chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disrupt pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's pledge and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the separate government, Felipe Calderons has been able to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 people in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama early this week at the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this.
Prior to his visit to the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was acting as governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this densely populated, wide-ranging part of the country surrounding the capital, the views about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo you will like to remember him.
The residents of the holiday resort assign to it the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that made Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement to the fragile, helpful roads that once existed here.
Plates with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressional deputy for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition that the new President lacks in substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the patched streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transmissions and represents in many respects a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot in Brachland near a large dust ponie, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the time of Governor Pena Nieto's office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that go beyond the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is announced for their violence and murder to innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he at least did not address the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typically for the descended district, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana started suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her lifelong friend.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is next to a cross that bears a single word: Justice.
But that's exactly what the family is saying, you've been holding her back so far.
The authorities have treated me like I'm a whisker, a troublemaker, a narcler.
You want to just accept your decision and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many mistakes and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's pledge on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been taken into co-existence in the last six years of violent crimes, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he's the way he was Governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
The public prosecutor claimed that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The state prosecutor objects to Bradley Mannings' allegations that he has been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to reject the charge on the grounds of strict conditions of detention
The release of the U.S. Army is proposed to have removed thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the public prosecutor tried to find that the armed Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - had missed several occasions to complain about his alleged misconduct in military.
In a cross-examined mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fine explained that documents on weekly visits by prison officials during Mannings nine months of imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia showed no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examiner, who was detained as a result of an application for defence for the rejection of the charge - Manning had already been punished enough by hard prison time - Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army's secret service analysis, which was arrested in June 2010, is being proposed, while thousands of confidential documents have been stolen in Iraq during its service period.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fine and Manning went through the forms that the officials had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he had been under increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment through the facility as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials had asked directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had voiced his concerns and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them.
"They wrote (after discussion of the concerns) "No problems", and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 that should examine the thoughts of suicide mentioned by him a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is a level of suicide threat - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and to get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for about two months before he was transferred to the Marinebasis Quantico prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and was once unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or in the outside world was a burden.
"My world collapsed on Camp Arajon, on this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in the move, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He has always had to sleep with light that entered his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and couldn't see his face again, he was raised to return.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer raised formal objection to Mannings treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he slept naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to hang out with his cover during this count.
On Friday's question, Manning reported that he had concluded from a command of his guard that he should have the roof he could have covered with fallen. However, he said that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked on the previous night. He had previously tried to show an officer that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the band of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experiences and that his detention will be drastically reduced, he should be convicted in his trial before the Military Court, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be guilty of minor offences while other prosecutions, which are considered to be too extreme, are to be prosecuted.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and a justification of the conditions is expected from the Public Prosecutor.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been established in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the favour of the enemy, the unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life-long penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them to memory difficult times, he says.
Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass when my advicelessness was spreading in me.
Paintings referred to two waiting lines: one for "Mexicoos" ("Mexicons"), one for "Externals").
I stayed there for a few seconds, uncertain which one I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just like my friends in Boston called "Iren" or my friends in New York called "Italian".
Later, I decided to "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or strings.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother-speaker, and I won't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself into the snakes for aliens.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is one reason why Mexicans today remain as high as possible in Mexico rather than migrate to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc as an example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartel, even though he did not mention details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship to the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans are likely never to lose a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under a reserved weapon to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official is also practicing the mildest criticism of Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and under the elites of the country - complaints about how Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the war road.
And yet Mexico's greatest challenge lies in the real relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about feelings?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or parent - did not get a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our trust is with them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and get good jobs, we should never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes evaporated, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly true of the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership board do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a moody defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not now see ourselves trapped behind the sidewalk - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who was legally immigrated to the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them for evil.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they don't belong to one country or another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but it's not rooted in any of them.
We'll be seen as Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we'll be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and members of the education bourgeoisie want to resume their links to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We are going to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and to exert pressure on political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
I don't know.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the wrong distribution of income, the unhappiness of corruption and the violence of drugs, many of us are not so sure if it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico some half a century ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a role to play in the way their family members have been treated for so long.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old fights, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected base for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the Keim.
In the midst of the usual instructions, countless buildings were laid in shield and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were shot near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether or not they want it - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these riots.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly patts situation could finally end it.
A War That Will Not Be Lost or Won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, this week's struggles have strengthened the hard-earned on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, is alleged to have pushed the Israelis back, although his own group had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are buried in one of the most isolated and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas so far.
In fact, Hamas wins in West Jordan, which is controlled by the rivaling moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Muslims in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a powerful, regional power that once considered Israel's most narrow Muslim ally, has seized the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Zealous Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic semi-moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebellions of an increasingly Islamist attack on Bashar Assads could stand before the overthrow of Jordan, where Hamas- allied the king threatened.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the strongest and most important Arab country at a distance - has changed the balance of the region in the southern flank of Israel.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be forced out by Israel and the United States itself.
On the other hand, the Israeli hardliners are making a contradictory conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer in danger.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself, and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
For at least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly committed to its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide killings - not least thanks to the blockades that have taken place in the West Jordan and thus in the main part of any Palestinian state, but they protect the Jewish settlements which have been declared illegal for international law.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party connected itself in the front of the elections on January 22nd under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more combative group.
Why do these former Palestinians also hate and abandon their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Jordan, wouldn't they fire missiles just like their competitors in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them, they should dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to implement themselves, but the Arab Spring could make them a strike by counting.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defence set is larger than its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the recovery of their economies.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi met with Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - perhaps symbolizing the beginning of a new era.
Israel too should think more about the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking decisive steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still being robbed of their right of self-determination - a powder paper that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only be aggravated.
Bloody missions to repress the Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demanding their diplomatic tributary over the years.
Both sides need an attack from outside
The right answer is that the rational representatives of both sides, the vast majority of the rest of the world and this newspaper are represented: two states in which Israel falls for security purposes.
The hope for the near future is that the ceasefire outside gives more influence to the implementation of this solution.
Now, with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must stop the arms supply in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the borders of 1967, supplemented by territorial change and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the request for UN observer status.
Obama too must contribute to Israel’s negotiation.
During his first term of office, he neglected the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems as if he was also reluctant to participate.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform packs of cigarettes enter into force
Health warnings and body parts on neutral green packaging equal to all tobacco brands
The first laws on uniform packs of cigarettes and tobacco have come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colours by neutral, olive green covers, which are printed with drastic images that show sick body parts and smoke of cigarettes to infants and children.
Apart from the various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the names of the brands printed in identical, small font is from the coming Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the most stringent rules for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to get young people out of smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies has shown that people who have not started smoking at 26 years of age will not start again with 99% probability.
"You can see from young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to apply for their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the world's lowest smoking rates and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational groups, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fakes will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say, however, that the laws have warped their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicone tyres has increased greatly to cover the inconvenient packaging since the British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court with their opposition to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hook is in the popularity of social media in exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from advertising, preventing them from acting as sports sponsors and forcing most traders not to put cigarettes in shops anymore. Now tobacco advertising is switched over to the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"He who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for his products does not go around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports about brands written by "very normal people".
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who finds so much like Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that industry focuses on marketing instead of dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to tackle the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions in the World Trade Organisation, although none of the countries engage in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersec, the government has conducted discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being enacted in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of Australian smokers show up in spite of this.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cup and stick the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, where a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city centre of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his regula.
"I used to need an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's what we're closing," he adds apparently.
In a constantly electric world it is nice to be bored even once
I spent five hours unexpectedly at the airport when our plane ended up due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another pilot.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts for a while.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport for half a day is rather nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts have long been positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or other screens, the benefits of the times do not benefit us anymore.
So should we welcome the long-term open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be right back.
Like many people, I have always assumed that for a long time it is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Bordom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"In fact, the time has been a very long story," he says.
The house wall Pompeiis boasts a Latin graffiti over long periods of time, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we actually define a long time ago.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that time has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that for a long time it was the experience to "want to pursue a satisfactory activity, but not to be able to do so".
Long time ago, it is different from Apathy, so that the person is not busy, but it would be.
On the other hand, there is no need to do anything about the apathy.
The key experience of long periods, he says, is in a "distortion of the attention process, coupled with bad pay and the feeling that time is only passing slowly".
For a long time, it can be heard almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions might be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German, for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of long periods of attention, which appeared in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment, where they heard a band where a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not understand this voice at all.
The people who barely heard the television reported that they had more time to feel than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could not find a reason for this and wrote down their difficulties of time.
If you try to concentrate on a difficult or demanding task, the interruption of attention can lead to prolonged periods of time, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you engage in an ingenious activity - "such as looking for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not feel bored".
In fact, as he says, we now know that aroundzalls and critzels, often interpreted as signs for long periods of time, can even fight by keeping people physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to go around learning more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored once in a while - my late flight, a dreary speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored easier than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale for long-term occurrence".
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are often bored as girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external travel.
But in general teenagers are a rather relaxed herd.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of the female adults in school and when doing household chores were bored, while 23% indicated that they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents agreed to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know if the percentages for the long-term have increased or decreased.
However, he made sure that "the youth will be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily life.
So go back to my original question: Is long time healthy?
Sometimes it does not, because in the extreme case it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to relieve them - they have shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between long-term and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"For a long time, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
However, while television can provide for happiness in the short term, they are running back and forth in the long term.
So whoever has an iPad for his pregnant child can take it away from it for a long time. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns how to entertain himself, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate for a long time.
We should not see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel well beyond constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be tired more often. But for a long time it is the annoying, inexhaustible desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are in truth only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is confused."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new Marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands before a court in southeast Colorado for an offence that will soon be legal in this state: The possession of some less marijuana cracks and a pipe with which he smoked.
According to Orozco, he and some of his friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drugs - knights' delicacy, each with a fine of 100 US dollars - and received a term of court.
"We're treated like criminals," Orozco says.
But he's one too?
In the weeks following the state's decision to legalise small amounts of marijuana for self-use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug addicts depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities affecting Marihuana are already being reported here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for small possession. This is permitted as soon as new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But state prosecutors in the more conservative areas of Colorado have announced that existing Marijuanadelicts are still being prosecuted and are still quoting people from court.
At the same time, several cities agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening up in their communities from the capitals of Denver to the Western Mountains.
"This situation continues so fast that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulators in the federal state of Washington flock to the head.
They wait for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, sale and sale of drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case a prerequisite for most states with regard to the regulation of Marihuana. The drug was only legalised for medical purposes and then for self-consuming purposes.
" Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for Spiritists in the state of Washington.
But Smith also says that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the final point of a grey zone where the state licence system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant practice issues need to be clarified at this time - such as how the state standard of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis businesses around 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nothing will be more difficult to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Balling Area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora an e-mail explaining that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller Marijuanadelicts in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now on" would not seek criminal evidence for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban regulations for the regulation of farmers of medical marijuana and that drug dealers would continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County in North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 persons must be held liable for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been accused of other crimes.
"Our authority has the duty to prosecute violations in which it was a crime at the time," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative, doubled.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer shows adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
This decision was supported by District Attorney Pete Hautzinger, but he also decided not to let all the pending property proceedings fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time exercising the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexes of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state under local officials promoted a deep-seated twin column in terms of the large green experiment to days.
In the case of district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who is represented by Marijuanadelicts in court and acting on the spot as spokesperson for the national organization for the reform of the Marijuanagessets.
"They have spent a great deal of their life pursuing people criminally that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national examples for the legalization of drugs.
While preparing for an age of legal sales, prosecutors and state officials are also looking forward to instructions from the federal government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of Marihuana at the federal level as a criminal.
The advocates of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be represented.
Despite several spectacular arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama government drug policy advisor, believes that while criminal officials are probably not going to enter the doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to push themselves into the legal, state-regulated Marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We look forward to what the Community has decided, and not to what the state has decided.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was framed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It's always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once considered to be the world’s greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I was planning to study history - I packed my suitcase again and thus led to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that Commillants had sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson emphatically explained that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I'm leaving.
Yes, I did, because I lay under systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had just been ridiculed for one reason - one reason that in this apparent way of lighting seemed more narrow and crueler: My now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisor to Margaret Thatchers and I was the advocate of the Conservative party.
Why am I saying this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students suffers from moderate rights under similar persecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that last week a group of them called for equal rights protection, for the benefit of the poor, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable because of their political views".
They request a seat in their college's Equality Committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was aggravated by a recently broadcast documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
Among other things, it was shown by a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and wore a silver-coloured suit and silver-containing gear.
Other universities say conservative students are considered to be "sin books for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without getting to know us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unacceptable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, said she observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights with JCR members.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred on the conservative party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had agreed not to grant any honor to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to reductions in university status.
The atmosphere would even scare Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students and tutors met, I got a taste of future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only endured the ridicule of Tory students but even participated in it with joy.
Political issues such as the miners strike, the privatisation and refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden tablerooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph".
I stopped by.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a kitchenette, and quite ugly.
"Don't you dare learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students looked.
In my eyes, tears came up.
"I suggest they take a few French hours in your spare time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt approached me.
I went back in my room with my head hanging.
This evening, I sat alone at the college at dinner when someone pointed me slightly at the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's what it's like.
Anyone who's suspected of being Tory is forced to.
For me it's bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters present themselves as supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to adjust later.
I insisted that I wasn't at all with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A researcher in the field of philosophy, politics and economics, who had ironically visited the Eton College that was considered conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was a pervert and shitty.
"How's Tories Sex?" asked one.
They're fighting each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet equals only after the dawn of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were ahead of me, in front of my spiritual eye, were a fire of commitment and isolation.
The only tutor to be openly recognized as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had consulted thatcher on foreign policy matters and had written speeches for them.
He was just rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and trimmed and denied it for its Marxist-Determinist history perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started hanging between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with friends and family in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said in a small tone.
They'd never do anything like that, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends have always put forth no effort.
His wet eyes were shaking.
Give the whole guy a chance.
I'm sure you don't.
It would break my heart if you went.
Experienced by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, as well as Tory followers, had given in to pressure and had given up his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was sneaking in before shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brain wash", and she called me "old trottel".
The relief lasted only for a short time.
It was my father who beat the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my horses gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'd like you to call me a sorority.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and wickedness.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is still hiding behind an undeserved call for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino introduces elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modem.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer in the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 garments of the Haute Couture were assembled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but without its distinguished client could not have been written.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the sticky and distant world of the noble.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read Aristocracy, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, via the Princess Marie-chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social rise from a modest fashionmaker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the icon of the international jet set.
Being in love in the Adele doesn't have to be harmful.
"At least they don't come out on your glorious carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We are all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress from Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also remembers the charm of the modem.
Many years ago we went to him for dinner at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome after a fashion show.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he was recognized and felt his influence.
"All the innkeepers felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", which began their career at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes..
View of the origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of oblivion rather than mutual love.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre walk that proposes a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walk to admire a dreamful "audit" that the masterpieces of Valentino wear, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience, fashion dolls reflect names such as those of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norway, Rosario von Bulgaria or Sofia von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a West type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I draw him to everyone else for his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very; they have plenty of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and the leader of the fashion Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentine's Day.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to that.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his occupation is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dress of the modem "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Mode
The big final of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his neighbors) were necessary to make this eleven-coloured silk garment with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four-and-a-half-metre long swivel.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savor-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Art et des Lettre, awarded with the honorary legacy, garavani cumulates as many honors as any of its customers.
"We are always his refinery, his rest, his well-maintained and perfect exterior," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was useless; time leaves no trace on him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human labour animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano are putting their lives and their health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur across the steep, rocky roads.
There are people whose work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
In addition, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the greenhouse gas that flows out of the earth becomes stuck in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sandstones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders across the steep path of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2386 meters, but the accumulated carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle’s leg, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not explode and collapse.
You know that every step can cost your life as this happened to a French tourist who crashed at the Kawah Ijen partitions years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur they decompose.
To reach the top, they take the path between the tourists who photograph them like circuses and walk with the tired heavy baskets three kilometers up to the weight, which a mining company has set down a little further at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in the volcano since 1960 and (not better said) its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of stringed wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each way," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes per day.
For each route he needs three hours, which he has fully achieved, but at the end of the day he then has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable reward for such a brilliant inhuman effort, but the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of miners here, where the coffee is paid 15,000 rupees per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurean on the island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to him, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sweat: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughed frequently and his eyes are upset because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sweat has already left behind his first tracks, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughed frequently and his eyes are excited because of the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-stricken young man could work as a tourist leader, a waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a transporter.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning for two hours because the sulphur also flows at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines in the dark.
Challenged by the shadow, he rises in the crater in the light of a small starlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the basket with sweat on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanised the welding industry to save costs, and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per camera, which the guardians of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human transport.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a consistent 42-year-old wearer who has been working for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues to "just go", because he needs the money for raising his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to rent, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and swallows the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners sinks into the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have been shaped by the weight of the body.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks across a path between the bay to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
"I will not go into retirement, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, who opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30-year-old also as a sweat carrier.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens blame them for not having children, for their careers, for the stress and the cost of property and for the education of children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our citizens' duty and we create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertising for minzbons, but yet - or just because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local language such as "Sleep will become a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising firm BBH, who has turned the video, has the hope that the advertising site will achieve in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to their "national duty".
This is just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we grow, we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that this is a matter for which we had to take care.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organisation of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue lightly is the Government of Singapore.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservativeism of its rulers and its strict social control.
According to its National Population Authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporens get any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to have significantly more options than to marry and form a family with regard to life's goals and priorities," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the exclusion of the marriage and childbirth, the result of which is the reduction of birth rates in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in migration in order to counter population reduction led to local sentiments.
In Singapore there are websites where the cascaded Xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result last year since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequence
While the falling birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the individual and that they scare the construction companies from building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out faster in days and even weeks than the larger housing units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, it adds that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines that had previously been put in place if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in national birth rates, the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial quarter are to be taken into account that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and education are expensive, why it is being pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their career, the stress and the cost of property and education as a reason they cannot have children.
That's why the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting kids - that's where the government can do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Private
According to the dictionary, this is the private or "that area of privacy, where you have a claim for protection against any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied on its daily and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to if he announces on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the Internet.
In four cases they linked the term with "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and user", when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't disclose in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or images of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The youth is aware that it is wrong to publish obscenity photos, from naked, from crimes, or to write political or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone's answering me, I'm just uploading them" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
He asks that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends to him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he says he does not know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made any statement to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone bothers me or asks me to remove him from my user account," he adds.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not known from experience known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was pushed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just did it privately."
Then he explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, these young people would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or painful situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I'd like to mix him up.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Keymaps
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, they need to understand that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; however, the rules of the game have changed with the appearance of these pages," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formulated these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion about what is spread, published or said, and this is at an age where tires are not enough."
"They should also be selective when it's most important to them to be loved to have thousands of friends without considering the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people is to ask them questions that bring them to mind.
"Tell them they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it online?
Or: Would you like it if you posted a photo of you, like what you posted by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Have you previously asked the other people for permission when you tagged photos of holidays?
And one more question: must everyone know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to give them to understand that they have to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Esturado Guardia, University Professor, Primary School Teacher and Educational Advisor, comments that it is indispensable for parents to read the social network guidelines carefully.
When they understand all sections, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what can be shared or published," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
End of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the South American Union (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven governments present.
Efé repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the 6th regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unassur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially shared that they would pass it after the closure, however, after explaining that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
On questions to the text, they stated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented to the press in short statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the Presidential Meeting without tone was transmitted in the pressroom with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was received by press speakers from some of the governments of the Unasur meeting, but not from the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media dissatisfaction, who demanded more information.
Then, the Peruvian presidency sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala declaration, not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru was host to the IIIth South American - Arab States (ASPA) summit, and despite the press's urgent call for the so-called statement by Lima, which had been announced earlier, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but to a large extent limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which creates a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process, initiated Lima against Santiago to listen to the petitioners on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently making with this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean opponent.
"Chile has been, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, closes agreements and submits to international courts," adds Piñara, and greets Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The two Presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the meeting since 2011 after the resignation of President Fernando Lugo from the Unasur, did not take part in the meeting.
The guest president Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state left the final document, which announced that 16 decisions were taken and the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for an investment amount of a total of $17 billion.
He said about the decisions taken, that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphant trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus unite our countries and develop new economic forms," the Peruvian President said in a statement read.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians located on the outskirts of its territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country serves for its resumption in the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico he was expecting a meeting with his opponent of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to address the maritime conflict in accordance with a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not only, and the deal with Nicaragua makes it necessary to speak with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to say to President Ortega that we will be civilized and treated as respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Minister of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with the idea that "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Presidents of the South American Union (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that Europeans were "in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "are today practically a father country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur advance.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, must be resolved; however, there are even more responsive sectors that are striving for a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those signatory to the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and on the contrary, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said as a reminder of the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had adhered to his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at that time there were "reasoned suspicions that Assange would deliver to a third country and would not comply with its procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish court who had asked him to be interrogated in his territory because of a alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish judiciary allowed this through a video conference that could have been conducted over the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that the risk was that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he will suffer physical and mental harm because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises freely.
"This would affect everyone's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum, the assanging has been granted since June in the ecuadors message in London, that he can travel to Ecuador, and that it is located in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities. He stressed that there has been a conversation with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founders of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures on various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain gives this letter tomorrow, this is done in my opinion."
And if Mr Assange, on the ecuadors message in London or via Skype, asked how the Swedish case was allowed and was made in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate, "the mediocreness, the evil intentions and the lies that deduce the free expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who are striving for and pressuring," he said.
In this sense he congratulated Ecuador no longer for such journalists "and also for not being ruled by the bankers or hegemonic and oppressive countries", and took the lead in a re-election "the revolution will deepen to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organisation "must remain hard and must not give up opportunism and should not give up the rule of law," because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian opponent, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime state of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries, for "absolutely".
This judgment is currently not implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and believed that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies when both countries commit themselves to accepting the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility of becoming a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third term, he said that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never been interested in power personally, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to travel back to Cuba after the campaign.
"It does not mean in any way a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Heads of State today took part in Lima at the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death because of AIDS is too late today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he got the diagnosis that the doctor without recognizable success "tryed to weaken".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this in such a way that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time it avoided itself the director of an IMSS clinic to decide "because it led to a bag gas."
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and has developed their immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases occurred, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit head Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immunosuppression of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years when counting 200 CDs4 and 50 years when counting 500 CDs4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can become "problemless 75 years as long as they are under control", said this expert.
In order to manage this progress correctly, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is true that 60 per cent of the patients reported in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May this year there are 187 deaths; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
So why do people still die?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's how it's in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people get in a far advanced condition because they don’t know their condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine of ten patients come to us when they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is necessary, so all persons who need this must be offered a massive recognition test."
This proposal is agreed by the experts and officials of the Council of State de Preventción del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients like Fabrizio who conducted his test at a private laboratory, and this is for the sole reason because it made him a friend of his, despite his young age, who was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarkom (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather place myself three times," you say.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio says, agreeing to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage with his testimony those who are afraid of today's global AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the ladentic
There are large gaps between health programs and the simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has adopted the HIV issue.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were handed over individually, now they give us a package with hundreds of pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a widespread issue of social workers, guidance staff in schools, pharmacies and health care staff who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent said.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; condoms should not only be behind the charger, but also in public toilets in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether to distribute condoms under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaging in sexual activity," he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally located in the 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS cases and in the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of inflammation occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was reached through a trade contest in Mexico, an unfavorable precedent will be created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country which has the payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes in opposition to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas leads to the fact that the Mexican companies are exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico Door and Gate to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the United States competition law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit with its seat in New Orleans first says that this is the main procedure for the trade competition in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures in the event of inability to pay by companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Standardization of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, and the American Law Institute was used as a lighthouse.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the companies recognizing the obligations in the competitive mass that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, whose commitments were confirmed by the Federal de Concors Mercantiles Institute of Commerce.
It is also true that, following the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro before the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is liable for its difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country battles.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same appeal, so that the vote would take place in the plenary, i.e. from all judges, because only three of them voted.
If not given, the Cerciorare objection, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, will be brought by the United States Supreme Court in this case.
The main point is that the Court also issued a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figure Amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), describing the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Trade Competition Act and pointing out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Act.
It will also be pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency which guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carabols: a battle for Vitro and for the country.
General statement
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud administration, have not been made forward for several months, the Association Union of Pilots has finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is being challenged.
Following this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the principal administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to remove from the trust account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administra Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is round
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental defenders, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, plus a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Processing Industry) has managed to bring together the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the Government of a Senate request to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassadors signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has not complied with, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had considered the possibility because it regarded them as a violation of the free expression in the social networks.
Homex Long-term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company brings homex stock certificates over 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four similar issues that promise interest every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Based on the company NYCE, e-quality and core, leading information technology companies, a company group was founded under the name Competival, whose goal is the software cluster service market in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball Was My Life"
The world's basketball boomer, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been connected to basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the country's basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was hit by a coup in 2008, Rexe was a part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, as a player of the first national league, as well as as a member of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball club.
"I've spent many lives in basketball, even though I was president of the BSN, chief businessman of the National Team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overstep this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and they testify.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember at his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-worker or manager of the club.
"That was my best years that I've enjoyed most because I've been part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships after each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, took over," says Reyes.
I know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you love him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best advertisers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gause would have taken care of another one.
He was granted the Vaqueros championship with Gaussian but was already out of range because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he intended to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we first won the U.S. For the first time at the pro-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the World Championship in 1990, where we placed the fourth place, which would actually have been bronze if it had not been for this Canadian judge who had us repeat the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It belongs to the best, as well as to those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gaussian, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which provided us with great joy, was that of the 1995 pro-olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter as a replacement for the locked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the Gold Medal against every forecast.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculin's Ortiz.
Its numbers are impressive at the level of international tournaments.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level like Piculin.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've ever achieved?
I was part of the most successful age of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN from the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, play only in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officers and judges.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I'd like to hear music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my single kids and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoyed the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, domestic and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the hagier of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role that he felt most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest party.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas's hospital, said her publisher, Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains," said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years prior to "Dallas", Hagman was known on television as a nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Dishnin" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at home with him.
He was also a performer of two comedies that were only beamed out for a short time, such as the Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His films included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charming shameful J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the TV chain CBS over the Ewing-Clan and other figures in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot J.R.?", which should create the expectation for an episode of full emotions where the figure was almost killed by Hagmann, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were voted in competition houses.
Thus the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who shot J.R.'s weaker (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had forced her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But there were also other reasons why she wanted to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: a conservative businessman and unfaithful husband who then sought to expose his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.'s tomb," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rest the noble citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-sponsor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "extensive personality up and out of the screen".
He is unforgettable and unforgettable to millions of worshipers in the world and leaves us who had the happiness of knowing and loving him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second chapter was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the sender informed.
From Warner or from TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theaters in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their place of residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything about which I thought it could hurt someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation, he applied for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist with anxiety patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations appear and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable at first, but it's gonna be good for you".
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of courses that study the "end of the world"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an insurmountable catch: the end of the "long countdown" of the Maya calendar on December 21, from which many believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, some called "Deudarmageddon", and a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't notice that this would be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé told the students this week at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what is happening in the world today, as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he remembers that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor that this semester, which should actually be the last one in history, offers courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, the visiting professor Barry Vucker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as how hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare themselves with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," she said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option to keep the course again, in case the world doesn't get under way," Restall said.
Despite the "foreseeing decline", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State the final exam is carried out on the eve of the apocalypse, so the students have no other chance than "to continue until night, where the world is supposed to end," Restal said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there was no place anymore," Restal said about his course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
A week before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if seats were still available.
The students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its shortcomings.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I haven't heard anything from a teaching where this is taught," he said.
I'll enjoy it.
But none of the students questioned - and less a professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in some ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never foretold the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, the rest of them said.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that brings back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the forecast of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there about the "End of the World".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an adjudication to an exception to a higher instance.
We have a treat from the Pope.
Restal pointed out that many days of the last court spoke about the years and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "the people immediately think about a new date" or that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to parties about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
