Barack Obama will receive the fourth American President of the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to the Norwegian Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American President in history.
Diploma, medals and check for $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife and will have plenty.
First, he welcomes the Nobel Institute, where he will first meet with five members of the committee who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The president's couple then has a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjo.
In the afternoon, the visit will be followed by a solemn ceremony to which Obama will take the prestigious award.
He gets him as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third one who gets the price right at the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will speak of the Afghan war when receiving recognition.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that the price is being taken over as a president who is currently fighting in two countries.
War effort just a few days ago increased by sending other units to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of his criticisms.
Obama also receives gold medals, diplomas, and check on ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The President-in-Office will then gladly introduce a banquet where he will also be the Prime Minister of Norway and another 250 guests invited.
Obama has built himself more durable from the beginning to the price.
For example, he says he feels he doesn't deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just about the price for him, but about all those who strive for the same value as he.
Right after the announcement, he said it was "a call for action".
Protection of natural persons accused of extortion
The Lithuanian police accused the President of the Civil Society of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society of the expulsion.
In a number of cases last year, he appealed to some construction management, demanding that investors withdraw money for their benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alena Romová.
The President of the Lithuanian Society for Nature Protection is Lubomir Studnička.
Now he's in jail and he's been threatened for up to three years.
Brno's class containers are not too wooly
In Prague, ordinary people can categorize packaging from drinks, you will again meet sorting containers at every step in the south of the village.
And in Brno?
There to win a few minutes before you find the right ashtray.
I don't want to say he wouldn't even get laid in Brno.
But I find that the fact that we're the second largest city in the Republic is that the advisors are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the laundry line of sorting waste not only by being citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into the sorting containers, but above all by the number of ashes on such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to throw PET bottles into the collection basket?
It's a finished bullet, mostly it wants time and nerves.
The only place I've ever met is in the Moravian Square opposite the Potrefene Husse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't get it.
Not that there is no honey in other parts of the waste.
A number of my friends don't sort out waste like that.
From the lens.
They've got it far to the ashtray.
I don't admire them.
After the celebration, I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colourable ashtrays on Kounic Street.
Luckily, I ran into the right place by the road.
However, the waste ran out of it.
It's still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city most, isn't it?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably the Bernese socialists don't care much.
This city would rather buy a hockey extralige that would make us ashamed all over the Republic than buy a few more containers and offer other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could confirm my opinion after a moment of online browsing with official statistics.
According to ECO-COM data, Brno is really the worst in the whole South of the country.
"Parubków" budget took money on pensions and hospital
After the left added despite the government’s opinion to farmers or officials, there must not be any money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction.
But also for interest on State debt or international court disputes.
It will create problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists advocated a rise in some groups, they believed that the government would lend more to sensitive spending, income or ill health. "It's just putting problems in the future, putting mines," Janota says.
The money borrowed is paid as far as interest is concerned, and sometimes it has to be returned.
There's no state to choose where to take it.
If it does not reduce social benefits or costs on the way to the state, it must raise taxes.
To everyone who now adds the left: to the firemen, to the teachers, to the farmers.
And later on, and their kids.
About the income or the patient whose account has gone missing 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry, they'll get it.
However, at the price of the state being more indebted, the next year will not only miss 163 billion, but more.
Despite my efforts, Minister Janota will continue to increase as quickly as possible and with him the cost of interest.
The State will need money at its disposal and will no longer need to increase VAT or reduce motherhood, as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
As a result of money transfers in favour of several groups of volunteers, there will also be five billion to build railways and railways next year.
This is mainly about already difficult and dissipated sections that are not redesigned and, where appropriate, decommissioned.
Mostly law-enforcement, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large buildings, also threatening to draw European money, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelk.
The ČSSD proposed that the loss of money would resolve the shalamounsky – it would reach the ČEZ dividends that most of them own, and that the transport fund would add up.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain, and it is no longer a source of income.
Last year, 18 billion ECU was added from the ČEZ budget.
Every year, the dividend pays for the disposal of environmental damage, the pension account is added to it or serves as a reserve for future pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit at the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP.
But that doesn't stop the carnival movement.
Nearly three billion were spent in the budget on various damages to the victims of communism and crime or on spending on judicial disputes, even on construction.
If you don't have that money, it's not safe.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay it anyway, Janota says.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the two-billion-dollar State Treasury project already under way, which is supposed to be able to monitor online what individual agencies are losing.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister didn't find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped, sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
The Americans will be counting to the future with a mobile phone on which the user will press the only button to switch between different operating systems.
The revealed plans are sounding promising.
Just press one key and move to Android in a few seconds from Windows Mobile.
This is exactly what the goal of the U.S. company VMware is to focus on developing virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into households and jobs.
Both will work at one time and at the same time, Srinavas Krishnamurti from VMware pointed out in a conversation for the Computerworld magazine.
He was presented in November last year and was first introduced a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully conducted a smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
It was adjusted Nokia N800 with RAM memory of 128 MB size, on which the Windows Mobile and Android systems were running at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators to test smartphone virtualization and devices should be delivered to customers during 2012.
A lack of snow on the mountains affects hotelers
They don't just worry about the crocodiles.
The lack of snow also reflects people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, free rooms are still available in the Giant Mountains for all winter periods, including Christmas and Silvestra.
We've got a lot of visitors on our websites.
People go through offers, find prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think Christmas will be on the snow or on the mud this year," said Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a Silvestrov stay in Špindler's Mlýn exactly according to his ideas should no longer weigh with an order.
Whoever gives preference to saving money and the quality of the accommodation is with him to the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler hotel owners have so far offered mainly weekly stays on Silvestra.
I think they'll be trying to get married for a while, but then they'll be allowed to go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will be killed quickly," Jandura estimated.
The free bed in all winter terms is still offered by the Ingtours Top Traveling Office.
Now we're most interested in a Christmas week that hasn't yet been sold out.
That's how half of the place in our offer remains free.
That's why we've already found some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
Silvestra in the Giant Mountains can offer the top travel office even more, but there are fewer places available.
It goes well for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter periods are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If they are snowed during the week, Christmas is sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than wool can be contained in the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Peca under Snow.
We're about five percent better.
On Silvestra and on Christmas we have the last few seats.
A great interest is in Polish holidays in January and is well sold in February," said the director of the best Beijing hotel Karel Council.
Of the eighty percent have Silvetrov residences occupied and Hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janský Lázny.
On the contrary, there are still half of the beds available in the most recent Janskolasen hotel on Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by the ice, which we already have an area of about sixty percent.
It's a little weaker in February, but once the snow comes up, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains is probably still rising, said hotel manager Omnia Erik Sporysch.
However, for a greater proportion of the snow, the crustaceans still have to let their taste go.
It's supposed to cool off on Thursday if there's any rainfalls, so there should be snow on the mountains.
But then the heat is to come again, Jiří Jakubský reported from the Czech hydrometeorological plant.
USA: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
It is comical, with what school effort Barack Obama, president of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself considered to be the stupidest.
Finally, when he had his eagerly anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had captured it through a copy from Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only does he use the word "as in Iraq" in the text itself several times, but he did not even hesitate to use the name Bush's January 2007 declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New road ahead".
However, he himself criticised Bush's idea three years ago to send fresh military forces to Iraq in civil war as "indebted and in its consequences of disastrous decisions".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of the Polish leaders was the only possible and most successful one that today's reports on Iraq do not speak at all.
Bush did not improve his reputation, but he objectively left his successor much more grateful to the situation at the beginning than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military contingent was again requested by the Polish commanders, in particular the senior commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordinary custom, strongly criticized the heavy-duty shooters in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men to break the situation for the better.
The president was shaking for three months, but he didn't get any better, and at least he's been hiding the generals with 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to make a commitment to another 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted at least ten.
The most problematic of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading armies from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the semi-annual increase gives the same fruit as the Iraq process.
Despite the brutal wars of the last few years, the Iraqi society is relatively well-organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite sign - no one can rely on and no agreements can be complied with.
The Afghan security forces are poorly prepared under these conditions, usually every day, to change the Lord according to how they do so.
Political institutions, even if formally founded, will remain only a descendant village, which will continue to be the patriarchal tribal relations.
The balance between the interests of different ethnic groups is unusually difficult because of the opacity of the ratios that are even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Nor is the construction of "acceding state", which is the minimalistic objective of the whole operation, it doesn't seem too realistic.
Obama's strategy's time horizon is infecting his volunteer.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sending into a war cry for the purpose of "fast return home" causes a miracle here, only the soul can truly romantic, reality unaffected.
From a political point of view, it is up to the Taliban to determine the date of the download of the troops to be completely irresponsible, since it will be seen by the Taliban as an indirect recognition of the US defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in war operations in Afghanistan is slowing down.
European politicians do not dare and do not want to explain to their fans how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of Hinduism.
Another factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran are not met, there will be a serious issue before the United States, whether or not they will try to solve the problem by military force.
The answer will have to be given at just the right time, according to Obama, to America's victorious descent from Afghanistan.
Each such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turn around in the Afghan situation.
The only trap for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential elections, so there is still enough time to come with another strategy, if it turns out to be a total defeat.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will no longer get cash rewards
The senior executives of the American Goldman Sachs bank will not receive cash in this year's reward.
It announced a company that thus reacts to the acute criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 front managers will get money instead of stock that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, the shares may be taken by managers in case they are over-risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency, is putting himself in the forefront of the effort to connect wages on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be issued, a former investment banker of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has become a target of criticism since it paid nearly $17 billion (about CZK 300 billion) in the first three quarters of the year.
The total amount of remuneration in the company this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High wages in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries as a result of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Britain announced that the bankers’ bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 Kč) would be able to charge fifty percent tax once.
He's making similar steps for France.
This year women won the Nobel Prize in all except physics
The record five women today in Stockholm took over from the hand of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustafa this year's Nobel Prizes in professional categories and literature.
In addition to these four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin Hert Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded by two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their countryman Jack Schostak, for research in chromosomes.
The price for chemistry was received by Israel's Ada Jonath, along with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of the fishermen.
The last winner was Nobel's prize for the economy that American Elinor Ostrom and her country Oliver Williamson won for an analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went around without a holder this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles As a research in optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyl have taken this award for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical remote views.
Each award was awarded a diploma, a Nobel Prize and a certificate of financial reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (about 25 million Kč).
If they are marked in more than one of them, the reward shall be shared between them.
Traditionally, the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has been received by US President Barack Obama at the Norwegian Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, for he is just at the beginning of his journey and is also standing in front of a country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to achieve peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering the demise. Klaus invited him to the Shrad
President Václav Klaus will accept, on Friday morning, the finance minister of Eduardo Janota, who is considering government overthrow because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for the following year, as the Ambassador's camera approved it on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps the maintenance of Janot's cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The budget also criticises Klaus.
According to him, he has too high a deficit, which further deepens the crisis in public finances.
The meeting was briefed by the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to work with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, which is now going to get Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should have a budget of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday, the House voted against the left-hand proposals for money transfers and raised money for the salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has called on social democracy's proposals to raise budget deficits in secret.
Between the left to the one and the government, Klaus and the right to the other, there was a sharp intra-political dispute, which led to the issue of the next operation of Fischer's official office, on which the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party agreed to be formed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of financial measures imposed by Fischer's government in the autumn and is intended to stop the State's debt.
Klaus, who could, but also does not have to sign the State Budget Act, said at today's debate with the businessman that for a long time the politicians had neglected "a serious problem", which is "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He says he doesn't have a good solution anymore.
The improvement could only bring a strong government that could also work on a broader consensus of political parties, my President.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Sometimes said that the concept of the official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the green ones is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer, in response, marked similar words for "strong sentences".
Chief of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek at Topolánka responded by saying that the terrible budget deficit that the former Topolánkov government had prepared for this year and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD marked the approval of the state budget for the next year for success.
The people were also at peace.
Mandel in Clint Eastwood's paper played Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Unbeatable will tell the world a lot about the country, about its fights and victories despite some criticisms that the main roles are made by American actors.
The story will tell about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandel.
An untiring warrior against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first Montenegrin President Nelson Mandel in his life story is an Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that a 40-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is that of Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
An 18-year-old actor who won the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the Million Dollar Baby box, for example, has created the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, the fictitious president of the United States, and even God in the Divine Evans, but rarely anyone else who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was 27 years in prison for his active work to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and then became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, Nobel Prize was awarded for peace.
Invictus is a Latin word for unbeatable and is the name of the English poet William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak as he did
The picture is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African football team Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after apartheid still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can connect his people through sports, so he will decide to unite the football players who belong to the world-wide dimension between outdoors.
The South African team will eventually enter the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on the plate.
I had no goal but to play this role so that I could get as close to it as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
He said that if he and the world politics were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that Mandel wanted to shake his hand.
I found out that when I press your hand, I'm overpowering your energy, it's transmitting, and I felt like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to be with another person.
Matt Damon is filming the film Françoise Pienaara, the captain of the national football team, where white players dominated.
He said he had six months to prepare for his role in the hard world of ragby.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pioneer in his home.
I remember how I rang the doorbell, he opened up to me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual submissions under the direction of director Easvood, Invictus: Unbeatable positive review and is also about the ambitions of Oscar.
Movie review by Daily Variety Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invicus received 76% of positive reviews.
The mystery of lightning over Norway dissolved: Russians tested the rocket
It was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence just yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border was testing intercontinental ballistic missiles.
However, it was again unsuccessful and shot marked as "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the blood of the Russian army, slowly becoming a black plague of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the rocket tests did not have an effect on the success of the pilot years.
The bull's mostly didn't blow up or get hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers it's already written about "Bulve" as "a rocket that doesn't fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This in the 13th series has been a normal attempt at the beginning.
By the end of the summer, there was a technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded at the third level of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" began from the atom ponorka Dmitrij Donski, which sailed below the white sea.
This type of rocket enables firing from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time swallowed.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was actually destroyed by "Bulava".
The rest of the Norses from the very first moment didn't doubt it was a Russian rocket.
The generals this time defend themselves and claim that they cannot speak clearly of failure.
The first two stages of the missile were sustained and the accident reached the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were destroyed immediately at the first stage.
Even though not one trial started without a mistake, only six out of thirteen of the defence ministers have failed.
Nearly fifty percent success therefore fills the generals with optimism and still claims that "Bulava" will once fly without problems and that it will even take up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total mass of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year annual contract in Cska Moscow
The legendary defender of Vjačeslav Fetisov is again presented in a professional hockey game in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and the holder of Stanley Cup will help with his team Cska Moscow and will appear in the Friday duel of KHL against Petrograd.
Fetisov, who graduated from his career in 1998, is currently President of the Cska.
After Denis Kuljash got hurt, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formalities, quote the agency AP looking at the Moscow club Sergei Germany.
So far it's not clear if the comeback of a famous hockey player is going to concern just one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, he said.
Fetisov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockeyist, according to the AP.
In the NHL, he played the whole season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe and signed 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of five famous Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympics, seven world championships, triumphed over Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in NHL, where in Detroit dress twice raised Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the hockey Sina fame.
Hyundai has appointed the committees.
The management of the Hyundai car with the teams agreed to cancel all the overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the committees announced on Monday that they were ready for work.
Confirmed the speaker's car Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, management wants to agree with the board on another Saturday shift.
We can't give up our production plan, which is fundamental, so a voluntary break was proposed on Saturday, December 19, by making two changes, Vaněk said.
Server Semmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who process the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 Kč.
That'll get people back on Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vanjka, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated by the proposed deadline.
Whether they let themselves be paid overtime or they can choose their spare time on December 28th, thereby extending their Christmas holidays by day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will get paid driving and lunch.
In view of the fact that the weather was the most urgent and hottest point in terms of the comments and complaints made by the experts, and the protesting employees who stopped the production alive last week, the management of yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all the weather during December, Vaněk said.
Car employees were forced almost every day of the week to process another two-hour overtime after the eight-hour shift.
Upon signature of the Agreement, the Committee shall withdraw the leave of office
Further negotiations between car management and experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The Head of Boards Petr Cooker said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are prepared to cancel the post.
The situation in the car came to an end last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees were self-employed because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged harassment.
The management argued that overtime employees had to work to meet the requirements for car delivery.
In their Monday statement, the board also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who had interrupted production on the previous Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the board requests the company to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay 5,000 kroner for her this year.
The Hyundai car now employs 2,000 people.
The company's serial production grew last year in November.
By September this year, it has produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also takes on 'complained' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also takes on viruses that have already been acquired against medicines of immunity.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the combination on the common variant of the virus does not work as strongly as some of the medicines already available.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients may have a significant extension of the life of the combination of medicines that prohibit the reproduction of HIV in the body.
However, their use results in a number of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of viral multiplication is due to the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Czech Academy of Sciences, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallic carborates affect the protein responsible for multiplying HIV.
Metal carborons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all medicines used today and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists come with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
Metal carborons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-valued cells made of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are bound by metal atoms, in this case by cobalt.
Traditional and Perseverant Virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV poisoning, there would be no mature viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain the scientists in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cells (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
About something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease agents was tested in the laboratory and also against its persistent (resistant) variants from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallic carborans on the usual variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the medicinal products are often ineffective.
The only mechanism of the effect and its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments both from metallic carbs are interesting compounds for further research aimed at proposing effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Rézacová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The D.O.S. went to Fischer, he's defending himself.
The head of the ODS Mirek Topolánek marked the approved budget for next year for "fear" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The statement by the ODS was marked by the President of the Government by strong sentences.
He's leaving time for analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr seldom said that the concept of the official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
The President of the Government has to decide, according to Untimely, whether he intends to join the House on a minority that is fighting an increasing deficit, or whether he is going to hold office with parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, he pointed out.
On Wednesday, the Commission adopted a budget for 2010, however, with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The depositary raised money on the salaries of state employees, on the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's approach to social democracy's proposals was, however, that the budget's deficit is raised in secret.
The Czech Republic should operate 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, so satisfied the government's wishes that even the modified budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and feeling of emptiness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government is still evaluating the current situation.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to leave the function in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered on Monday after the government to the prime minister.
He pointed out that he was considering further interruptions in the function.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks for the next battle with the budget deficit, they do not have, according to the Untimely government, what the ČSSD nominees do, which changed the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will give a demise if the House adopts other laws on increasing deficits, such as those relating to sickness, pension or new service law.
Topolánek: Nomination Ministers of the ODS
It's the matter of Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS nomination ministers did not do anything wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text report.
He recalled that in a number of ministries there are people reporting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Sometimes he stressed that if Fischer decides to resign to the principle of combating the public finances deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct that it is about the left-hand majority that is currently in the basement".
Then he cannot count on the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to me, I'm going to dedicate myself to it, he told reporters in the shelter of the defence minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government by the civil democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to the Brussels European Council this afternoon.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS has resigned
At the same time, at the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister of the People's Democrats did not expressly request that they allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not seem to be orphans, we are not small children, then we have responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget did not make the absence of the chairman of the party in Parliament and the Czech Republic difficult.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the following months it was going to be mainly about the Bolshevik shooting and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD order, less trains are going to be nearly the same.
With effect from 13 December, the Czech roads will cancel or limit some less heavily loaded speeds and locations, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of transport is reduced by two per cent from the date of the entry into force of the new driving order.
Most tariffs including basic and customer drivers will not change.
For example, the people of Ostravska get more connection to the main city, the paths on this track add one set of pendolins.
On the contrary, the accelerator will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less rapids will also go to Prague - Sand - Czech Budějovice, mainly limited direct connections to Prague - Letohrad.
From the regions, the roads are planning the biggest transport reduction in the Royal City, a total of eight percent, but Prague and the environment can be happy to grow.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several fasts on the Prague - Sand - České Budějovice route are only limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovichti must go to Lysé nad Lab.
It is the 15th link of the urban system of Esco, its opening is possible due to the completion of the electricalization of the track from Lysé nad Lab to Milovic.
Remote connections to the main city will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Schumperka/Jeseník will go at two hours intervals.
Pendoline to Bratislava no longer travels from December 13th.
This year's account for regional railways: 200 million more
It quickly orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, in total, the so-called demonstrable losses give the expensive next year four billion crowns, as this year. The locals order countries, in total, will pay the next year eight billion crowns, with less than three billion countries contributing to the state.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Locals and fasts have a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The roads are approved by the system, and this is why they have apparently not been able to increase the prices of the bulk of the vehicles.
There are only 1-day network rides ČD Net and eLiška cheap internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLišky will take place again from a narrow distance, so far it has been the same for the journey between any regional cities and made 160 crowns.
The Philippines continues to hold over 50 people, children released
Today, the armed forces in the south of the Philippines have taken 75 people, including a number of elementary school students and their teachers.
It was introduced by the AFP agency, which initially informed only 65 prisoners.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 armed men are using hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree to issue the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP police agency, kidnappings were initially prosecuted for the violence that prompted the creation of accounts between the two local clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a state of permanent law was declared for a recent massacre killing 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to elections to the Government Office were 30 journalists.
To suspect involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province and his father Andal Ampatuan, an influential patriarch of the Ampatans, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao there are also Muslim separatists.
But they restored the peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech means Invictus: Unbeatable), which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of a world-famous apartheid fighter was created by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
The man's later role as a legendary South African champion in the rugby of Francoise Pienaara was created by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the picture into the movies, they stand out from critical and public announcements
Nelson Mandela
He was born on 18 July 1918 in the South African Union.
In 1988 he received Sakharov's prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 together with de Klerke's prize of peace.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations, since it comes to the public at a time when in the South African Republic, however, the preparations for world football championships are at the top, but the media are alarming reports of growing racial hatreds and discrimination by the black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the announcements for a new film in JAR for the time being are all positive, despite numerous exceptions to the inclusion of the main roles of "proflakly" Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman is proud, according to his words, of a new film.
I've been dreaming about that role for years and I've been good at preparing for it.
I also met Nelson Mandell myself many times to, as it is called, drain his energy, talk after the film's famous premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandell's personality and message in a movie.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everyone, he added.
In the training of the national team of rugby
Image based on the book presentation by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and a game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African human rights defender during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to stifle two races during the film and for many years the mutually defined population group, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he is also in the acting role of the South African national rugby dress on the world Cup playing field, which JAR won at the time.
To enter the lawn in a dress, which is understood in JAR almost as something sacred, Mandela slaughtered a large sheep mostly of the white public fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, led by Rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" in the national team.
If the tension in the JAR gets better, it'll just show up.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as the example of Christopher Dawson, who fled to Britain in his recent LN interview.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
In Loneska, the transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns
The fire struck the morning transformer of Čeps in divorce at the village of Výškov in Lounska.
According to the speaker of the oral regional firemen, Lucas Marvan has six units.
The firemen originally wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reevaluated the opinion and the fire threw away mixtures of water, foam and special hashish substances.
The reason was the technical error, the internal shock of the transformer.
No one was injured, an accident according to Paully Mandat's spokesman does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, exactly counting it will succeed until after the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will have to replace it with a new one, according to the Mandate.
After ten years of operation, the company Čeps had nothing like this, and this type of error was isolated, supplemented.
The electricity supply was not affected by the operation of the households, offices or companies by the trafostation fire, according to the spokesperson of the Czech Republic for the northern Czech Republic Soni Holinger Hendrich.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, electric control 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transmission to the distribution system and the driving route of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura gives a criminal notice for a three-heitman talk from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura today gives a criminal notice for the three social-democratic Heitman talks.
And that's Michael Haska from South Moravian, Radko Martínka from Pardubic and Heitman from Olomouck from Martin Tessarík.
Janchura introduced it in the Twenty Minutes Radio Journal.
The complaint concerns companies' efforts to operate regional train transport in some countries.
But all regions have finally signed long-term agreements with the Czech Dragons.
All three Heitmans are attacking us and talking about picking roses, but we've only made an offer for what they wanted.
They say we are more expensive than the Czech Roads, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Roads, which were closed last week.
So we don't have enough to defend ourselves.
It's for a talk to the Student Agency, he said to the Janchura Radio Journal.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that he had not taken his steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing to encourage the European Commission.
The press release of the criminal notice is considered to be another continuation of Mr Jancura's media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising of his company and his own people.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and my country and to the same challenge as the other Heitmans.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jancura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the area of regional rail transport, Hasek said.
Jančura announced last week that he was investing several million crowns in advertising that would alert the countries about the unfavourable step.
He told the radio newspaper that the campaign after Christmas would stop and continue in it he wanted after New Year.
He made it clear that the campaign would be directed against corruption like that.
Jančura started the campaign after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Dragons and to order around 150 billion crowns did not issue tenders.
According to Jancura, similar proceedings are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the countries, Janchuro was already in danger of being sent to ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't let it go, we could lose a bus license.
He's introduced himself as a ČSSD envoy, I know which gentleman you're talking about, I'm not saying his name, he said today to Jancura Radio Journal.
Expectation against tyres will be free and non-compulsory
Expectation against the iceworms will absorb the usual habits.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time non-compulsory.
However, the vote is already being called to make the expectation more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free guesses against tyres shall be made at the top.
The medical institution is already setting maximum prices for vaccines that will pay health insurance.
Experts are also clear in the process of expecting.
New Circumstance
Free vaccines for children in August
From January, children born on 2 August and later can be culled free of charge against tyres.
The condition is that they have not received a single dose.
Anyone who started to shave last year or before must pay for his own repertoire.
The first dose should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
She voluntarily let her children fight the tires of a quarter of her family.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
When expecting younger children, there are four doses.
In general, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between 300 and 450 thousand crowns a year on evaporative doses.
But they'll save for the treatment that children would need without the expectation.
So far, he has given about 500 thousand children every year for all the country's expectations.
The so-called "Janot" package was introduced.
Pneumococcal causes central ear inflammation, but also serious infections including strokes of the brain and blood vessels.
In the case of a Pneumococcal infection, we will die in one year, according to a hospital investigation, up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children were expected to face tyres in 40 countries.
Will expectations be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions arise that this expectation may be mandatory in the future.
It's supposed to be covered by insurance and non-compulsory.
For example, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civil association, pointed out that it would be better to expect better.
Its association has long been promoting a pneumococcal vaccine.
The experts at the international conference that our association participated were not fully satisfied that we had a voluntary expectation.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has succeeded.
I think it's the road that we need to go on now, he said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the forecasting process against the Pneumococcals.
At this point we don't consider it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršenj.
Voluntary Expectation Has its Advantages, Hard Doctors
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Expert Society of Practical Child Doctors, admits that he has a voluntary expectation of his disadvantage.
If all children were slaughtered, it could be thought of a reduction in the number of screenings "For the situation where this vaccine is so high, we understand relatively the political decision that this expectation has been launched as voluntary," Cabrnoch says, of course.
Experts expect that he will allow his chicks to attack his pneumococcals from next year more than 80 percent of his fresh parents.
Expectation against tyres is also a breakthrough in the fact that, as the first superficial expectation of children, health insurance is built, not a state.
The insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving it for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy their own substances.
However, it is related to the concern of the practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies, and physicians would receive them the same way that the state supplies them to others.
However, some Members feared that insurance companies could "make money out of health insurance".
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substances and wait for them to be paid by the insurance company.
It is estimated that each practical child doctor will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of an American artist 's stole in a museum'
The son of a renowned American maker, Frank Frazetta, was accused of trying to steal images worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frasetta and the other man were used to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains Bagr region.
Mr. Frasetta Senior, aged 81, celebrated himself by the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as the Press Association said.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer who stated that Mr. Frasetta's younger could have been motivated to act by long-term family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frasetta issued a younger sworn statement, at the age of 52, that he did so to his father's instructions, "to get into the museum in any way possible and move the images into the sweetening space," said the agency.
Mr. Frasetta senior denied any authorization as the agency has indicated.
Labourers Against the Planned Increase of Tax
Ministers defended the increase in taxes and cuts in expenditure announced in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, the entrepreneurs and the committees.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Torys have been "insinuating" the possibility to show that they mean seriously delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until a time after the elections.
Even the chancellor got under fire for poor workers with low and middle income.
According to its proposal, there is mainly an increase of 0,5 % in social insurance and 1 % in the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Distinction of social insurance
The committees protested that low-income workers were punished for the recession they did not commit and warned against "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - an increase of approximately 3 billion pounds a year - which has led to the support of the business community, which has stated that it is a tax from employment, while it should focus on economic recovery.
This increase, which limits these revenues to more than 200000 pounds a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY BODIES OF PBR
Social insurance will increase by another 0,5 % since April 2011
The economic situation is worsening more than expected by 4,75 % this year
New tax 50 % of bankers' bonuses
Growth 1% corporate tax for subscriptions to small companies
Reduction of taxes on electric motor vehicles and electric motors
Increase in income measurement by 2,5 %
According to the government's estimates, some revenue of 30000 pounds is reduced by 90 pounds per year and some revenue of 40000 pounds is reduced by 190 pounds, while some revenue of 10000 pounds is increased by 110 pounds.
The ministers announced that their target of reducing the deficit by half by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making", but argued that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of people with the highest income.
The Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the proposed increase in taxes and spending limits would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would be necessary to carry out.
"These are large numbers, which will allow us to reduce the deficit by half, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should come at the end of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the volume of the necessary loans and on how the deficit will be reduced quickly - must be considered after the chancellor has been forced to review the previous instalments.
In its opinion, the decrease in the economy was 4,75 % this year - far worse than the fall of 3,5 % predicted in April - because loans were 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Immediate opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, which protects against the "debt crisis" of laborers, marked the planned loan of 789 billion pounds over the next six years as ineffective.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan to compensate for this, added "cynic" to postpone this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after elections if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourers insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future shorts in contrast with Tory's proposals, which would want to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money obtained by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support expenditure in the coming year rather than to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "based on sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said about the timing of the announcement - for example, the above-mentioned inflation is increasing and will result in the failure to pay the dose in the next April - that it could lead to the Chancellor's indictment in the election campaign if the money was found hard to get back a year later.
But the Labourers insist on providing special assistance if people are going to need it very much and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspect budget'
Although the ministers did not publish the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economists indicated that it was clear that the reduction in public expenditure would only be the beginning of the medium-term restrictions.
The renowned Institute of Budget Studies has announced that the number of officers indicates significant cuts in many areas, possibly in the future, including transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the elections if we win them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the bookstore of Deloitte's accounts.
"That was a report on the suspect preliminary budget.
The FBI is investigating 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a Pakistan prison in five Americans suspected of attaching extremists.
Men were arrested for assaulting the house in Sardinia in the province of East Panjab, as the BBC reported to the US Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation into whether it was the same men who were declared uninformed in their last month in their residence in the American state of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are said to be originating in Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors, and the other comes from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were held," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit reported that the agencies were informed about the arrest and were in contact with families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to identify their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
It stated that the house was always a center of interest to the local police and that charges had not yet been brought against the arrested men.
The foreign ministers of Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, the press agency Reuters reported, but stated that the United States must "cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in exposing the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Absent amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, according to Amnesty International's travel report.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the regime before and after the presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected the above-mentioned criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and tens of them were killed after the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadine, leading to the largest street demonstration since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were arrested, and the defendants sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran John Leyne, now located in London, stated that in earlier protests, High Chief Ayjatoláh Ali Comeiný declared the wrongfulness of certain torture methods and banned their implementation in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no legal criticism of power has been tolerated, as our writer said.
False confession'
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology from Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protests against election results.
"Frequently they were in my face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head, threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubí was detained after the protests and was sentenced to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior state officials denied charges of rape, but admitted torture.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who claimed that he had been held in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate election concerns and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and authority of the authorities were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were vaguely published.
The Panel noted that at least 90 persons have been detained in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park, a ski lift was created
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow has been used to turn the memory in Bristol into the main race track.
The railway for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the train station in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump bridge ahead of 100 m long train.
A fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said it was a beautiful view from the top of the bus stop, but it was really exciting.
It was a beautiful view of the bright lights of the city down.
Here were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Prices were made for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the bus.
After a Thursday night's competition, the snow was left to dry.
Still them and us
Can I be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minerals and generally spread horrendous reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe, the American academic wrote and informed himself and wondered whether Muslims could integrate - and whether they were integrated - into one of the most unsecured secular societies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author of the last work, "Why the French don't like the head dress" (2006), this elegant and debated study on controversial issues that have been dividing and occupying the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened on the basis.
He spent months in the mosques, schools and institutions that are now taking care of 5 1⁄2 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on issues that are most concerned about them.
Should Must I enter into a marriage relationship in a mixture or in a council (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslima have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These are apparently the world's controversial issues that are being debated and that are part of everyday life more than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of assets, teachers and intellectuals, among others commonly known persons, excluding Tarika Ramadan, Araba, a Muslim researcher and academia born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion of how it can be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society.
They don't have any arguments for all their habits.
The Conservatives are incredulous about the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen interviewed are joining the domain that it is the anti-polo of Salafi—a proponent of the Purist Sunni Islam, associated in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It raises the question of how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so stubbornly defends the secular public) are really devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in the matter of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republics.
More than the development of pragmatism has found out "shrewd values."
After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The world’s most unsatisfied views
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the other environments of the planet.
The limiting ice is the alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The loans of oil, gas and fisheries companies must focus on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, resembles the natural history of the North icon, the polar bear.
Well-informed with complicated history and vehicular processes, it describes the long tradition of polar researchers who have tried to strengthen the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old sailor who fought only with a shell is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who were swimming for their dead mothers' bodies were captured and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in one circus state.
Even today the fences in the zoo typically have a area a million times smaller than the area they have available adult units in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
You'll find more after clicking here!
Mr. Ellis draws from the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they are hunted by helicopters and Indians on skis, and all are armed with effective attack gloves that shoot their own benefit.
Ironically, it's being played in the water north of these two hunting nations and that ice will finally be the largest.
In his new book "After Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfied responsibility for the science of the Arctic and a puzzling summer view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trails at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries indicated the first movement of the floating ice.
The ponorks for the Cold Wars then papered the sinking ones over when they were submerged.
Satellite research and wide range of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still being done thanks to vulnerable individuals staying in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the backward system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water that freezes when it is frozen.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic wonders, it is all doomed to decay once the summer ice moves, which is sometimes played between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it can be us'
6000 members of the seamen put their hands on the graves in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours by bus to put a simple van on a soldier's grave with whom he had never met.
For him and the other members of the seamen who made their way from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville in North Carolina to the National Cemeteries in Arlington to decorate the tombs, that was the day it took hold of men and women who used to wear the same shoes.
In a few months' time, when we get in, it can be us, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me to show me respect just as I try.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put the nuns at the cemetery of veterans in several departments at the Arlington Summer Act.
In 1992 Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, started this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during the Southern Act in Arlington.
Now it's an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. NMorill and his wife Karen take this trip every year and stop in different cities along the way to worship the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
Worcestesters don't look for profit in it, they're counting across America, which they own in other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 barrels in the Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon area, the National Cemetery of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart's foundation is dedicated more than $150,000 to the purchase and transport of von der Waals.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, reported that she had taken a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a retired armed force.
Since her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to what the victim was doing.
It's a small way citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family grave visit.
Swallowed in a blanket of warm matter, volunteers went through the cemeteries around the lawns and attics.
Volunteers headed for the oldest graves of the first and second world wars and the Vietnam Wars, because these are not visited as often as the newest graves.
The excitement was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they transported a young boar to our gravestones.
Each round bean was dark green with a small red area of the upper part of the bee.
Near § in section 60, where most veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, really remained silent.
The United Service Organizations devoted 1000 vortexes to the decoration of the department, but the cloudy mood of the wars just under way filled this area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some read aloud the names thrown into the stones, while others agreed to see the small black and white names pressed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed tears from her son's grave.
She spent eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the last resting place of Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, rules.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be who will remember him."
U.S. Government Supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as the foreign ministry officials introduced on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. with a residence in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular officers, together with the American section of interest in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
Certain charges were not published, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical states, are at risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
In Cuba there is a young blogging community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country in order to take over the prices, but her permission was denied.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of the growing tension between the communist Castro brother, who ruled Cuba, and Obama's administration, which has been monitored as "resistance tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first to report on the New York Times' arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and sought-in comets in a country where the average salary of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used by sending text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day’s wages.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and in some government accessories, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign in must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in the prison in Cuba are on the Internet for acts of drug abuse, said Gloria Berben, the press director of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide any more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly moral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Watch Group, who recently published an unfavourable report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Daddy Cuba," as a response to Raula Castra's installation as the leader of the country and the compensation for the hideous older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the charges were often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, even if these two countries focus on a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are revealing a conspiracy regarding the sending of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities revealed the alleged leader of the conspiracy concerning the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, pointing out that they hoped that this case could help reveal the vast network of terrorists who are tracking the Internet and searching for radicalized young men.
Investigators have reported that they were searching for a shadow of the rebel personality known as Saifulláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after they first discovered when one of these men published a comment approving of the terrorist attacks on YouTube.
Saifiláh took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the Pakistani indigenous tribe zone, which is home to al-Qaeda and its camps for training terrorists.
But the Pakistani rapporteur, who reported on the case, said on Saturday that Saifulláh was unsuccessful in testifying to the leaders of al-Qaeda and that men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were exiled for several days to the eastern quarter of Sarghoda, far from the horrific mountains in the northwest, which became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a hit unit.
The reason they were murdered was stated by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that the men were not frightened and were still trying to obtain consent to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law.
The case of this five - who remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - underlines the critical role of voters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, the determination of who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has placed the highest priority on attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organization's spokespersons act as guards, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be investigators.
American fake recruits have been detailed at al-Qaeda's special examination, analysts have introduced.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, the senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation with a U.S. based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years, allowing them to join because American intelligence agencies have gained expertise in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to get into these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? Mr. Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is far more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodana, demanded climate action
Tens of protesters walked down the streets this Saturday and demanded more action on the climate than the negotiators at the city convention center of Bella.
The protestors reported the number of participants in this event, but the police are hoping that the number was close to 25000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists put a few small loads near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day of the small incident in the climate talks that sponsored by the UN, thousands of activists passed through the city and carried transparency with English inscriptions "This is not a planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, who said "The country says 'a lot'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish models and photographers by Helena Christensen, who said that she had traveled to her mother's home in Peru and provided me with information about the state of affairs of the country in which the impact of climate change is still taking place.
That is partly why we have decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading personality to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to carry it out. It can't be avoided.
The police prevented the protestant from approaching the center of Bella and stated that she had 19 people detained, in the first place because they had either wearing masks or wearing pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the unparticipated spectators who does not want to be identified because they are involved in climate chats, masking activists like athletes and in black clothing have put several demands near the Kodana main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were excited about the buildings, he said, they started with lights, but then they followed "some big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the program during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't penetrate into the minds of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether, despite the demonstration, it had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he answered in English "Currently, that is something that I was not aware of" (actually it's something I don't know).
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is huge, I can't hear what's going on out there."
He monitored whether the passage was painful or helpful depending on the views of everyone.
It is to see the concentration of the broad public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate of knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of the good news about public education in the Columbia district.
Although the district is far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress among the students of the fourth and eighth classes in the last two years than in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Certificate Centre for Learning Progress is the enduring differences in the knowledge achieved between African Americans and white students, both on the local side and on the national side.
In the last two years, the average score of white pupils in the fourth class of the territory of Colombia has increased from 267 to 270 points (of potential 500), but in their Afro-American strata, only three points have grown, from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress in African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant deviation of one point from 245 to 245.
The average score for white disciples was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The image in the six-year-old horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade pupils in 2003 when the first NAEP was carried out in the district was 60 degrees (262 to 202).
Although the outcome of both groups improved during this period, the difference in complaint was about 58.
Some district education advocates said last week that the results, celebrated by the secretaries of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were largely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the range of support at the higher end of the stage, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, Executive Director D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality of participation in the district.
I did not jump up and down for two or three points, said a member of the Committee of D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large) who has a daughter in the fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs. Rhee's administration, Mrs. Brown pointed out that the report on the results test means secondary school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious you always want to see the bets and I respect it.
But what's terrible is that we haven't spent almost any time and energy that we needed to spend on our high school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the effort of the county is to continue looking for better ways to focus on the needs of low-income students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading bases, Wilson's reading system, focusing on students of the upper classes of elementary schools and high school students who have not managed to manage the reading bases before in their careers remain significantly behind their peers.
Every day mathematics and the basics of mathematics education into the sixth grade, highlighting the games and experiences of real life that came to the county as former director of Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the call for progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think we should continue to work and make the best efforts of those students who remain under the grade, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others said that the results of the NAEP explained the question whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's a certain winning dilemma of Mrs. Michelle Rhee's, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Conventional Approach for Correction is to focus on funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the Columbia district.
Thus, the focus can lead to political rumors that are directed against an important agenda.
However, the rise is also among the other city directors who are trying to maintain the average distance between the white and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to use our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to provide excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district in order to enforce school validity.
You have to get up to 200 days in order to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teacher association last year for the school year for 185 days, which is a "sign" to seek a greater increase next year.
Make higher education part of a better future
The train bus went to the University of Gothenburg with a loud respiration.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and began for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciely's parents had a hard time graduating from high school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela alone, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the college floor.
Now she and other eight-class students in the group were studying Gettysburg, where the school cost $38690 a year, their position was more than the fear of visitors being excited about potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Graciela who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? rules of thought when they saw a low ratio of teachers to students.
The Pennsylvania train was one of the seven who visited their classroom and were now fully interested in the next report: The question is not whether you will enter college.
The question is where.
However, this is a problem with the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from high schools or who are pregnant as minors, but there are the statistics of those who receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, five of this "long generation" Spanish students from college - remarkablely achieved results suggest that many of their immigrant parents, most Mexicans and Central American residents, have arrived in the United States without finishing high school.
Their story of success is important, researchers say, because it underlines their point of way forward for a generation that played a part in the field of labour.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they have had a natural tendency to school and a natural tendency and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and millions of children who would like to graduate - especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to guide them in the system, no matter how simple an intervention at each point does this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from Latin America.
We need to think about providing these children with an attractive network of pre-school years in all ways to study high school.
The federal program that financed Graciely's train trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (appropriate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch further preparatory programs that start for students from low-income groups in secondary schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than % have entered colleges, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to accept significant oil companies to rebuild its non-debt infrastructure during the two auctions held on Saturday.
The ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a significant role in the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies have just gone with capital participation to two out of 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field that was being held in June.
The brief participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysis.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies you have first on the way to Asia and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It'll be a long time before there's anything else in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about security, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings in Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the American army are likely to reflect American companies from much more intensive company in Iraq, which has manifestly the third largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. firms were in trouble, in particular the Chinese and other governments controlled by energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the Ministry.
The leading American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were senior shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids on more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is trying to become a major economic, as well as technological force, spokesperson for the Assam Jihad oil industry.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
The companies that were previously selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the ministry at the price of bars, and the ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level on each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
With the impact of an American missile at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it was likely that the top planner of al-Qaeda operations was killed, as US counter-terrorism officials announced on Friday.
As has been confirmed, this could be a second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car Thursday near Miran Şáh in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities found that the missiles were fired from the aircraft without a type of crew operating the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were listed on the white car that headed to the Afghan border when it was hit, the officer, together with the Pakistani cyclist intelligence agency, called from Miran Šáh.
The officer stated that local armed forces had joined the point and had a quick ambiance, which was left of "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the victim's identity, but two U.S. anti-terrorist officials quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somalia was a post-mortem.
Somalia was introduced as a highly established planner for al-Qaeda military operations, which led the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the founding of the world, said a senior officer who does not want to be named who has given a sensitive sense of American air strike in Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was given instructions from Al-Qaeda's highest leadership and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another U.S. official said that Somalia acted quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a widely known person for some Americans, but that he didn't humiliate himself in any way to invite our allies and us, another officer said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second highly established leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban who should have been killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant group in the belt of the indigenous tribes and three other senior poperative leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft was reduced from the summer of the average approximately six operations per month to two according to Long War newspaper records, website managed by the non-profit group.
The reduction may be due to the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also unintentionally killing those suspected of being informants, the site stated.
The United Nations High Representative has resigned in Kabul.
The High Representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to resign from his post in March and would end such a stormy period of functioning, which had been the subject of widespread corruption charges in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure is due to Obama's administration's decision to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate stated that it was supporting growth, but expressed concern that the US timetable for reducing the state, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up building Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they have confidence in international society, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The agreed commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel helping in the political change of Afghanistan.
The growth on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he didn't give up, but that he was just fulfilling his promise to his family in March 2008 that he spent only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has now indicated that he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's the highest time to look after the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials Ban, he started looking for a reward.
The officials indicated that it was decided between Staffan di Misturo, who had Swedish-Italian origin and who had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, who had previously led the UN peace operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzaim, who won the country's presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machines.
Eide denied this claim, but stated that Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "has certainly damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of sceptre in view of international intervention" in the election.
Eide noted that he proposed a meeting with the highest citizen representative for the coordination of relief efforts in managing the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to enable its successors to hire more United States workers and other Western countries who would lend them to the Afghan mission, because he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money was properly used.
Eide expressed disappointment at the restriction of its efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the UN heavy-hire regulation undermines its ability to use its capacity.
The United Nations rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain only one person from May, I said.
It's a disaster, and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon be imposing "more significant sanctions" on Iran due to the lack of involvement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey through areas where they are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, have been stockpiling the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
That's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned about something from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is unimaginable predictability in war.
Obama's administration decides on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and bans" would require "to take the Iranian government to really feel less secure with nuclear weapons", because "her inhabitants will suffer extraordinarily" with sanctions.
According to the Friday opinion issued by the spokesperson of the White House Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved the European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences unless it brings its nuclear programme into full line with the UN Committee on Nuclear Safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In its discussions in Geneva on 1 October, he pointed out that he wanted to return to the talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial share of his uranium-enriched resources in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administrative Board was based on such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to make time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran has deviated from the interim agreements - in part, therefore, the expert points out, because Iraqi leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage in the United States.
In fact, in the case of Iran's resistance to the international community, in the case of certain proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think that this has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a road that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to the proposals before returning to the search for other elections, including follow-up, which foreign ministers call Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In its opinion in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned on Thursday what it called "unwarranted and unsubstantiated charges" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue in talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before leaving for Kurdistan, rich in oil to meet with the troops in Kirkuk and the Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
There is a high tension between Kurda and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to prevent the retention of US plans to limit the number of US soldiers from 115000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to resolve Kurdish anxiety from persistent depression. The official places of the United States quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In the elderly China, change in course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, where they read that "The Earth's Mother is too exhausted to use more children" and "One child also means one more grave".
Then they learned that when official government seats in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth and ageing in their city, suddenly changed course this year and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always spent all our time and energy on just one child.
We didn't leave anything for the other, says Wang, 31 years old, human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
For more than 30 years, China's long-lasting policy of having only one child has been introduced and has created two generations of notorious bubbling and succulent children, affected by the nicknamed "small emperors", the country is in danger of a population crisis.
The average birth rate decreased to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy came into force, according to the United Nations data.
The distribution of the population, where the population is 60 years old and higher, is expected to rise sharply from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with a high school population, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, 60 - year - olds and older made up almost 22 percent of the registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the employment rate in the future".
He says it's "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Step-by-step reconciliation
As was introduced into the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of one child is probably the most controversial mandate of the Communist Party.
The two who have violated politics have faced unscrupulous torture -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination in work.
China's official locations have called for a policy that has helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in the pursuit of politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to cope with the loss of their second child.
In addition, many couples had to face sexist election losses leading to unnaturally high male relations with women.
In recent years, population officials have been progressively smaller in their opinion on the policies of one child.
In 2004, they generally supported the learning of exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were singles - and in 2007 they calmed down the dictatorships of their strong lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor of population research at Beijing University, said that central government officials were already discussing more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was a single.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more babies.
Nearly overnight, posters were being sent by parents to replace only one child with copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be lawful to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and to dry the air under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, the officers introduced for family planning.
A Closer Response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai noted an increase in interest among the two who wanted to have a second child after the campaign started, most of the city districts did not report any changes.
Huinan City District with a population of 115000, for example, still recorded four to five cases a month.
Disappointment officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but less than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai District of Caol, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason people don't want more children.
They want to provide the best of the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said she would like to have two children and they were legally allowed.
But like many Chinese people who have only insufficient health and life insurance, they are provided by the government.
Without a touchy catchnet, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West view one child’s policy as a wrong legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in connection with the first child.
Yes, we were delighted to have more than one child.
But the only problem is politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point to psychological reasons for weighing.
Wang, the manager of human resources, says they love only one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of the attention of our families and all cared for us.
We were not used to providing care, and we really didn't want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who is a leading translation company, said that much more uncovered.
For secondary parents who reduced birth, he said being successful means being selfish.
Today, 20 and 30-year-olds view their parents as undergoing the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want to live this way for themselves, he says.
Just one child sets huge demands on parental time, he says.
Mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions from the proponent -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary prepared at the time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The United Nations Group has adopted a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching attitudes and mutual respect -- again on Friday focused on the release of a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations with the most of the burden in the near future.
The text that can provide the starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation highlights the remaining obstacles as well as highlights the way forward.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Kodana next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unmistakably indicates how much money rich countries should provide to those poor people to deal with global warming in the short term and in the long term.
And it provides a whole range of elections for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature growth should be, which will still allow political actors to tolerate.
This provides a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequitt, senior representative of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, decomposed from 180 pages of the text of the conference to focus on what the top climate officer at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as "a great image".
It sets out outline for a possible agreement where industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent year-on-year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union quickly discussed Friday's pledges that it will provide $3.6 billion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from flood management and drought to drought prevention.
However, on Friday, he introduced the same type of verbal fire extinguishers that were prevalent in the discussions last week.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern has rejected a speech requiring a mandatory limit on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to the voluntaryity of the major developing economies if it was not financed by the developed world.
Posun signaled that Obama's administration had become a stronger line towards China without Bush's administrative officers just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the Treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of the actions, Stern said, who also claimed that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the US chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "rural understanding" or "extraordinary responsibility" had led to a week earlier the United States not helping China financially to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic pathways of the major world powers in the bet, both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current battle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States as regards the fulfilment of their respective obligations, while poorer nations point out that two tenths of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative for carrying out more important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in looking for a way to ban large issuers in their actions.
It is a clear game of the development of new economic hegemony, Ulate said, who also serves as a regional adviser in the area of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change indicated that they would like to continue to pursue a legally binding agreement in Kodana, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the negotiations would be a political agreement.
The Small Island Alliance, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that prosecuting by small island nations "caused a political pressure on the entire polar process" partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The negotiations sparked new urgency as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government were involved in the agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of the Interior, stepped out of the aircraft and went through the halls of the Bella Centre to the closed doors of the meeting and new conferences so that they could address the demands that will be assessed next week.
The total scope of the meeting - when 13000 people were moving from and to the convention center each day, guitars playing activists were performing ironic gaze at the countries they thought they were sending, and there was more to hand out hand-to-hand proposals on paper than electronic mail -- a challenge.
The intensity is just a construction: in Kodani, almost all key ministers were present and earlier on the average 60 heads of states.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Policy in International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming.
British first train at 140 miles per hour prefined this Monday's feelings
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the vissitudes went through darkness on the sign of the departure of the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to the London St Pancras and exceed 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal assembly outside London.
It is hoped that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland with London.
Precipitated standing water should be reduced during passenger transport and on commercial routes and the transition from aeroplanes and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, three main political parties were allowed to obtain this vision.
But tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental damage have now contributed to the construction of British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, as the Times stated.
It provided him with a detailed map of the route of another planned stage of high-speed network.
The new route of London's connection with the West Midland was proposed to be within five metres in urban areas and districts where access to life centers could be problematic.
In the open area, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also expects to determine three options for the wide high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer the spring.
The preferred option is to confiscate the form of the Y font, where one high-speed track should lead to the Western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has come," said the railway knower.
Once it's done, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow the passenger to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to drive 2250 miles per hour, which would do the fastest in Europe from the British network.
The initial track is already designed to carry trains of 400 m long, which would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on London - Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
In view of the capital limitation, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to include a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis announces whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if the wheel is moving, the network should be built by parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed lanes, but on existing lanes north of Birmingham and keep the driving times between London and Scotland for over three hours.
This is regarded as a decisive starting point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to train, the reference point for the revolution on the railway.
Tax collectors paid a mortgage of 75,000 pounds in Tory's orange.
Alan Duncan, the holder of Tory’s front desk in the parliamentary Chamber, paid taxpayers thousands of pounds last year for the orange he built in his home in the electoral district.
spokespersons for the prison, which was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs were living "from the suburbs", increased his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a deep covered extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month for taxpayers.
The general authorities approved the claims on time and thus was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Leggem, who carried out the control of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan expressed his demands "it could be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-bedroom houses on all of his polling districts, Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth about a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is named in the plans as "orange."
The neighbors describe it as "a glass of fun and hospitality."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increased loan during the last audit by the General Standards Committee and the privilege of the last mortgage settlement.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed his fiscal security at the mortgage amounting to 271406 pounds from his property in London to his polling district, which he bought in 1991, year before becoming a member of the parliament.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan charged approximately 1,400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds a month.
The interest of the RBS mortgages of Mr Duncan could not change at this time, which suggests that all of this was intended to finance the loan of 75000 pounds.
In December 2007, the default variable RBS paid the mortgage decreased from 7.94 per cent to 4 per cent in March this year, where it remained.
The final document of the General Authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds a month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as a shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed it and said that the MPs must survive "on the side" after the spending scandal.
"In principle it's nationalized, you have to live for an inheritance, and it treats you like s**t."
He said, "I have lost money for my garden and a claim and a little break for what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn stake, but I won't do it."
The messenger, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first called to explain his edition in May when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit in the form of a librarian in Mr. Duncan's lawn for a protest after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked about an increase in the mortgage last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was because of an increase in capital, which was approved both by the financial authority and subsequently by the Legem."
He added: "This is not a controversial question of hiding and clicking or breaking rules or anything else.
It's absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, legitimate, and that's all.
This could not have been much more clean or simpler in other ways."
Come all check out the cabin on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
Beaches in Brighton found a new meaning in life in the winter months as an interactive adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that stimulated the Duke’s use of creativity called on 24 owners to build up their cabins for every day in December and to use Christmas bikes as the theme of this show.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to see the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 each day, and the Bishop's bread and roasted wine delivered free of charge.
Selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, About Come, About Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the chat was representing the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant to television marketing from Howe, is a priest without a scholarship in a chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in a stirring way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in chat rooms came up as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we have tried to try and present it on a spiritual path."
Strong mobilization in Kodani and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, demonstrated themselves around the world in Kodani, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organizers showed in the cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the UN Climate Conference, which aims to enter into force on Friday of January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish climate conference president, said that the growing global mobilization, with clear evidence of the current demonstration, contributed to the "political tax" of any failure in Kodani would be too high.
According to the newspaper AFP, incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the launch of the flood, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began to break up the exploding blocks and furniture.
The police immediately struck.
Overall, the police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and stated that it was particularly the members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "no difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in the streets and in the seat "maintained in the streets on Saturday evening" and even in the extreme winter.
Following Parliament's abandonment, the cause of peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
For the speakers, a podium was built, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the celebrations for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from large European cities and other than the Africans, there was also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue cloaks, created the first assembly in Kodani in the afternoon, at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we're going to the streets to demand an ecological debt settlement for the benefit of the South, explained People Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say anymore: it's time for this to be declared by the Bosnian singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa rivers and streams are drying up, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 at the time of the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of combat for the world has approached ecological organisations.
French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Kodana with the aim of "coupling climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers.
There were hundreds of people in Manila, mostly students, in red clothing, and with coats evocating the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators went into the streets with the requirement of an important measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organised by the "350" raids, especially in Paris, Marseille (jj), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen her president, Georgia condemns it as "fashku"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi declared this step "freak".
Some 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 on control over the South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The polls closed in 17h GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, a few hours before the closing of the polls, 58% were involved.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday on Sunday.
All five candidates, including the President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of joining Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are fresh.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "is sorry that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of this territory was recognised by 216.000 inhabitants only of Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian forces.
After the division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, where several thousand people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said AFP Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapš.
She was one of those who came to choose to go to the election room in the school in the capital of Suchumi, to the beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian sovereignty is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can be proud of its beautiful nature.
After this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, there are huge billboards with Bagapš along with Russian President Dmitrie Medvedeva and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, west of the country, the Russian officials, who came to watch over the fair elections, welcomed the warm welcome of the interim mayor Beslan Arshby.
"We, Abkhaz, are grateful" said at a small ceremony, having in mind Moscow's support and in particular her decision to acknowledge Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and added glass vodka to it.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimb and two traders Zaus Ardzinb and Beslan Boutbow, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as an agreement that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia rail network for 10 years.
Fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
For victory in elections there is a 50% surplus plus one vote.
If any of the candidates fails to achieve this result, the decision-making team shall take place within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Kodani
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding an important and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodani, demonstrated themselves around the world in Kodani, where about 700 people were arrested by police on that occasion.
At least thirty thousand people according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organizers showed in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts up to 18 December delegates from 193 countries, on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Following Parliament's abandonment, the cause of peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
For the speakers, a podium was built, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the celebrations for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, incidents occurred shortly after the departure of the pipeline, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black cells and armed with bricks and furniture, began to break up.
The police immediately surrounded them and attacked them without waiting, while several protesters hit the country.
Overall, the police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and stated that they were particularly members of "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, Eastern France.
Later this afternoon, one police officer was injured in a furrowing bone and four cars were burned near a squadron near the incidents that resulted from police sources holding about 20 people.
We focus on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from large German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people dressed mostly in blue cloaks were created in the early hours of the morning in Kodani the first meeting at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we're going to the streets to demand an ecological debt settlement for the benefit of the South, explained People Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say anymore: it's time for this to be declared by the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa rivers and streams are drying up, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 at the time of the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of combat for the world has approached ecological organisations.
French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Kodana with the aim of "coupling climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organisation has called several well-known personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to talk to the dab.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothing and with jackets evocating the importance of solar energy, were protesting in front of the Philippine city council.
A number of hundreds of demonstrators met in Hong Kong and Jakarta with a call for significant action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organised by the "350" raids, especially in Paris, Marseille (jj), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The subjects of the geography and history will be strengthened within the framework of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel said on Sunday during a discussion for the JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" in the framework of the reform of general gymnasiums, although their training will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on accurate science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for everyone there will be the same program from a general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the Minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy", because according to him specialization S is not focused on accurate science" but "in essence there are the best students in it".
EC and L specialization cannot be with what sub-specialisations, continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have complained that there is no geography and history in the last year of professional high school".
A study by the agency Ifop, published on Saturday in the Journal of Humanity, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) disagree with the government's project to abolish compulsory teaching of journal and geography in the graduation year with specialization S, so many intellectuals and teachers criticised both left and right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "does not come to mind" to abolish philosophy in the specialization program of the Mature Year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in education for students, while 16 organisations (students and committees) called for participation in Tuesday mobilization against this project, which they considered to offer educational education for future professors of high school.
Within the framework of Master's Study 2 (M2), the Minister explained the beginning of the annual admission test aimed at their sector and at the end of the year of the further test verifying their ability to teach.
The participants will participate in the training courses during the second year of the Master's Study and the first year will appear as a professor-internist before the pupils.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before the reception procedure, you will get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which has not yet existed in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite university of the École normal superiors have 15 minutes to convince them about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Kodán Summit: this is the challenge announced by Jean Jouzel in the meeting this morning, the Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) to encourage the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the conference "Ernest", which is a one-day seminar composed of fifteen-minute expert contributions that will be filmed and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and based on what they should be more inclined to learn more, he explained at the 22-year-old Edward Hanneso conference, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local pond, which was named after the students.
It is estimated that 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines will be selected and clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About warming the climate "we can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only by graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with hope that listeners will know that "the conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific basis".
The videos on these lectures will be posted on the school web since 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and the next will follow with regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: anger of prison guards, planned measures
The Prison Supervisors' Committees announced on Friday "general mobilization" because they demand that prizes and overtimes be paid to them for the Christmas holidays, the reward of which has been postponed for financial reasons to ice.
The prison FO (2nd Committee of Oversight Officers) asked employees who would not have the service to participate in demonstrations on Tuesday morning before the prison facilities and to "block them" and thus to warn of "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Oversight (3st Committees of this sector) was called upon to "call for meetings in individual prisons and start basic mobilization" with the fact that it is "funny and unacceptable", so that "times and contributions for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October were not replaced.
First Committee of Overseers, the Federal Union of Prison Overseers (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for total mobilization (...) with the aim of showing dissatisfaction and frustration".
The Executive Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes has increased considerably in 2009 and not all have been included in the financial budget, but ensures that the amounts due will be repaid in January.
The Office stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mariová sent a message to the prison supervisors' committees ensuring that the payment would be made next month.
I know about the efforts of the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, he writes to the ministry in his statement.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which has arisen by miscalculating the number of overtimes, has never been repeated in the future, has been added to the Minister Alliot-Mari.
Prosinc's salary will therefore be low, with the exception of management workers who receive famous awards for the performance and achievement of the objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for those "there will always be a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO Union in Marseille has become angry and announced its decision to boycott to revoke "all meetings and calls".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless their allowances for these days will not be paid in October, as in the case of the weather, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when we are constantly being given more work and more jobs without being made available to us by other staff, it is sad to allow those lowest positions of staff to be paid, says CGT-prison supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to the committees, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case of financial resources because few, General Secretary of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
Obama claims that he gives "better gifts" than those he gets
American President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, entrusted "bohini" to Oprah Winfrey's screen that as far as gifts are concerned, has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get".
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the series, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening at the ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residences.
Even Bo, a small four-year-old family partner will get his own bra.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama by saying that the dog will also "of course" get a gift, as it comes from the slots from the pre-supply series.
And Michelle Obama also took a stand against her husband's claim about the quality of gifts she's getting: "No, of course not. I gave you the first prize last year," the president complained.
Well, it's true, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after with humor he showed his finger on the pearl necklace of the first lady: "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hourly very relaxed series with a famous moderator who actively supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the husband Obama also talked about their most favorite gifts they had received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a ten-degree transfer bike, but also a basketball ball dedicated to him at his father’s Christmas, which he met very rarely.
I remember seeing my father coming to see us on Christmas and giving me that basketball ball, the president told me.
Long after that, I realized that the ball actually gave me.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, and so I fixed all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around my chest, but that little doll house I loved remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL says he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of the "damaged" resulting from the larger operation he underwent in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the station of RTL indicated that the singer was in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
66-year-old rocker was again operated from Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "the injury resulting from the operation" of the endangered platoon, which he spent in Paris on 26 November, informed his press department in Paris that these lesions required "correct surgery".
However, the section of the singer's press tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical communication would be issued within 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main partner of the last tour singer, Johnny Hallyday was introduced into an artificial sleep to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little bit more certainty, he'll deliver the RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on the AFP question.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drainage was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic because of a hot plate.
The surgery, which was planned several days earlier, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajux, a well-known doctor in artistic circles.
However, your doctor was not available on Thursday to express himself to RTL.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that occurred after the attack.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, said on Thursday in the radio RTL that his friend was just going through a "bad period", but he added that he didn't care about rocker, because he's a big "bosser".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he's doing stupid things, because 12 hours in the plane after such an operation there's no fun, said Eddie Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the situation calmed the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he didn't notice any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer vary only from July when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was discovered that Johnny Hallyday was operated on "a small tumor of thin stomach" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which was presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on the stage.
In mid-November, his team had to detonate the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Busquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchus Frédérick Bousquet, a three-fold medalist at the World Championship in 2009 in a large pool, won the title at the European Championship on Thursday 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline that he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which combinations are finally allowed, only three world records fell, although they were expected to be much more.
One of them beat the Hungarian competition Evelyn Verrasztová to 200 m of ground race and two remaining Russian male staff to 4x50 m of ground race.
A great boutique for Busquet, who has made an appeal to the world record in a 50 m free way, which is already the holder of a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimsuits, 50m free way, the 28-year-old Frenchman won the final 20.53 seconds in the final, at which the prime minister launched ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Busquet defeated Croatia Duje Draganja (20,70) and Rusa Sergeje Fesikova (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20,30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all vessels had combinations made of polyurethane that would be prohibited from 1 January.
The combinations helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ended in Istanbul, which was the first host in 1999 to compete.
The use of the combination this time did not even help the Germans Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large swimming pool in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young sailor failed to overcome a record that holds 400 meters in a free way (3:32.77), but won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian runner Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew I didn't win the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival to the future, explained by Biedermann.
USA: Romanian sarcophagus board owned by Zolvi was spent at 1.5 million USD
The board of the Roman sarcophagus, which was none other than the French writer Emil Zolvi, was spent on Thursday for $1.5 million, which is significantly more than was estimated, said Sotheby's artist.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high front boards, from the third century of our year, was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "presenting four dionysian scenes in a elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satires and bakchants is a rare piece of similar pieces in the world is very few, perhaps four or five," AFP announced on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still going on, but it's an object that was probably the most attached to it, he told the agency of the AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Abnerthy.
The fact that Emile Zola ordered this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board had been in Rome for nearly 300 years at the famous Borgia Family Collection and then gradually appeared at the French actress Cecile Sorelova, who enjoyed a van with her at her private hotel in Paris and Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France and briefly the President of the Council before the entry into power of Petain.
She stayed there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found in the search for a museum database in Louvre that this board was part of "the remains of Emil Zoly" opened from 1903, year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresh "Rougon-Macquart".
A interrupted attempt to leave President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded Thursday that the conditions for the carriage of the rejected President of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure were not met.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelay at night, everything for the time being points out that there is no way to carry out this transport, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos, has introduced.
The Mexican government aircraft, which flew to Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelay, flew back to the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The government of the plains wanted to get President Zelay to "democracy" and to ask for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with a safe exit.
But the rejected president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The government of the plains "successeded when I wanted to give up my functions (...), wanted to give up the demise," Zelaya said on Thursday to the Global Radio, in which it often expresses itself to the political crisis that has lasted in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, he's added a deposed president, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, and he's been playing some chords.
The Embassy of Mexico asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Minister of Interior told Honduras Radio HRN, Oscar Raul Matute.
I won't ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview for Telesur Station, which has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduras people, he stressed.
The news of Zelayi's departure mobilized in the middle of a coup d'état, who came to gather around the embassy of Brazil, where the army strengthened its defense.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the state of the state.
They're showing their marginal attitude to international standards, added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was defeated on 28 June, on the day he organised a public consultation in preparation for his re-election and against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, army and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on 21 January and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and held accountable for the crime of "vessels," which he's accused of, the dirty government claims.
On 29 November, President Micheletti managed to hold presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later Congress voted against the return of President Zelayi to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street stands up, U.S. trade balance promotes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with an increase and the results of the American trade balance testimony to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final conclusion data, Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 has improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on "half a full glass."
For Peter Cardillo from Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The decline in the United States' trade balance fell by 7.6% in October, at $32.9 billion.
The analysts were expecting an increase in the ladder.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
Much news is the growing volume of trade, in particular exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the United States’ main trading partners, Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com said.
In the United States last week, however, unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of employees reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new entrants has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouliler of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The market with precious papers also dropped.
The cost of public funds with a 10-year outlook increased to 3,482% on Tuesday evening and the return on 30 flights increased to 4,492% on 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of regime supporters wrote "Ladies in White"
A number of hundreds of Cuban regime supporters wrote out on Thursday the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on World Day of Human Rights and prevented further demonstrations to which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", a wife or close political prisoners were posted directly on the street of the Raula Castra regime in their march towards the centre of the capital with a requirement for the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Away with Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were scandalous by the high-stranded supporters of the regime on dissidents.
The dissidents were finally escorted by civilian personnel who came "safety".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against "ladies in white", but there was no injury or arrest.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, police officers were detained in a civilian area of about ten dissidents who were also going to protest on Thursday on the occasion of World Day of Human Rights, the AFP journalist reported.
According to this journalist, the police imposed dissidents who had been drafted by government officials into civilian vehicles for the use of force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours.
The holders of the 2005 European Parliament's Sakharov Prize, "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to disentent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 are still on the grid.
The Cuban authorities consider that the "fells" or "agents" paid by their criminal enemy, the United States, are in favour.
The final miracle, the Cuban television reported a quarterly demonstration of the government's regime's supporters against the "responsors of the revolution".
Cuba, with the Communist side in front of and the government's policy, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organisations of non-compliance with human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
He killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
The wizard, armed with two knives, killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 reportedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or before the hospital, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
Severely injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance Police Union in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this medicine or before it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband of about 30 years began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured person is in danger, according to police sources, it is likely that vital organs have been infected.
The pregnant woman then came in and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," said the police source.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police said, then ran into the street, still on the Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two others, probably by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, seriously.
As it all happened, it was not quite clear because it was all played in the evening hours.
He was armed with two cutting knives, which he carried with a cross behind his back, said at the site of the Alliance's leading union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several traveling people, including young people, have tried to stop and arm themselves, according to the testimony of the assembled AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They didn't succeed because he was pretty strong, he was commenting on Alberto's situation, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He threw himself into a den, including one of the city policemen who broke his arm.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61 level, two police cities, including their leaders, tried to detain an armed man and were injured by fists, the police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
They came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and I saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big stomach wound, told AFP agent Frederic Allion, a thirty-five-year-old doctor.
Five minutes later, another 30-year-old came to the hospital, who also had stab wounds.
A man who didn't have any IDs arrested after the state police.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed over the case to the Investigation Department of the Regional Police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
The police source didn't exclude his location in the psychiatric treatment.
Another police source said there was a need for six police officers to handle him at a police station in Clicha, where he was transferred.
He was "all beyond himself" as "all the mad ones of this kind whose strength in action is increasing tenfold."
USA: Polish lawyer once again asks for an end to criminal proceedings
Polish-French director Romana Polanski once again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the West of the United States) to stop criminal proceedings against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to the moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film director "Pianista" criticised three judges of the second-period court in California for a serious misdemeanour that occurred during the trial in 1977.
I demand that the appeal be suspended now and now, said lawyer Hummel and added that from the behavior of the judge who decided on the case at that time, Laurence Rittenbanda "had a cold in her back".
According to him, a judge (who had already died among them) was supposed to act allegedly with a state representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison — which is a serious violation of the law.
Information on this interview was provided in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), by David Wells, the spokesperson himself.
But Mr. Wells finally announced at the end of September that he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Judge Hummel will require a court hearing in which he will be able to submit evidence of his claim.
The complainant reiterated what had already been said in the first state, because there would be no serious awakening of an application for a suspension of criminal proceedings until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76th anniversary director fled the United States in 1978, before the court brought a judgment in the case of "unlawful sexual contact" with an unaccompanied girl aged 13 years.
Ever since then, he's never been in the United States again.
Attorney's representative in Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to participate in the trial."
In this case we want to show not only the Roman Polish, but also the other accused that it is possible to escape?
It is the view that the director "asks for favor and at the same time insults his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to decide also stressed that there are "other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't himself asking to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the eternal burden every time the Polish case was invented and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 February in Switzerland on the order of the United States
After more than two months behind the grid, he was released to the home prison in his chaplain in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a demonstration.
Wall Street ends without direction, it's slowing down the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without any direction, the market disappears between indicators that are better than expected in the United States and the rising dollar price: Dow Jones received +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq has left 0.55 points with technological dominance and ended at 2,190,31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management said.
It stays in a tight range, the volume of the trade has dropped very much and I think it will stay that way by the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and which "helped to improve market mood with regard to stability of economic recovery," analyst Charles Schwab said.
In the United States, the retail market grew by 1.3% in November, which is already the second month after itself and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the trust of American consumers also returned and grew sharply in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices have been hampered by a new rise in the dollar price towards the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down the sector sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological action thus loses ground under its feet.
The stock market is down.
The government's 10-year income rose to 3,540% on average in the middle of the evening and with 30-year-olds it rose to 4,497% on average 4,492% on the previous day.
Miss World's election again in the South African Republic.
After a month's journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for Miss World's title on Saturday are going to go beyond the target date to reach their dream: to be chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has already taken place in Johannesburg for the second year, and for the time being five candidates have obtained a way to the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were during their African stay chosen Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was a real faith of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things, and I have so many experiences!
The competition that has been held in the South African Republic since the ninth time will be broadcast in a direct transfer from Midrand to northern Johannesburg since the 17th hour (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country where I could plant a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could have enjoyed it twice, I've believed in Miss Xenia Sukhin's world, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was carried out in the spirit of frequent meetings with other candidates and the new revelation of the country and its "countries that breathe".
After months of shows, trials, press meetings and safari, Miss now concentrates on her own competition.
Indka Pooja Chopraová hopes to go in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who will also participate in Aishwarye Rai, the 1994 winners, who both became Bollywood stars.
To be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about sight.
We are slaves to our countries and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates are presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The presentation will be presented by Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former beauty queen of the South African Republic Michelle McLean and chair of the Miss Douglas World Committee.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the heat it is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, President of the Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, attended the safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on wheels, and tasted local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who had hit them with his hand.
For the unusual president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
There is no doubt that the most beautiful memory will remain the lotion in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010 and which helped the country to support something more.
I could've met people I didn't even care about.
I'm sure I'm going back to the World Cup 2010, says with the enthusiasm of Miss Italy Alice Tatichi.
According to David's son, the news of Hallyday's condition is "very positive".
The news of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday on his departure from the plane that he flew from Paris at 13 a.m. local time (21 a.m.)
The son of the singer, who acted quietly, said that he would "fastest" be delivered to the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for post-operative infection caused by the operation of a heated interbredal platinum, which took place on 26 November in Paris.
According to the press release, the night sang in Los Angeles was for the reason that it was comfortable "to be put into artificial sleep", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already referred to as an artificial sleeper. Hospitalization was due to the infection after surgery of a heated inter-brother plaque carried out on 26 November in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this attack , the singer had to be re-operated at night from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to a photographer AFP, his wife Laettia attended the French high school school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, visiting their daughter Jade.
Advantage of the orthopedic surgery and traumatology department of the hospital la Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that the singer to Los Angeles will leave on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphan Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who was singing on November 26th, operating at Clinique international du park Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, I said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I personally spoke to my doctor on the phone, and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, because I had already suffered twice the heat of the interstellar.
Earlier at the radio station, RTL indicated that the singer had apparently flew after a Parisian operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he then acted on.
In 2007, Charlotte Gainsburg also operated on the elimination of hematoma caused by brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Dr. Olivier Metzner referred to him as "a man without a clot", who is "regularly" called before the medical chamber, which cannot even be "recommended".
After several hours of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made his point through his lawyer David Koubbi on Friday.
He announced that the procedure had "very good progress" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The health problems of the singer since this year are growing and in any case it seems that another tour of the singer remains with the questionnaire.
It is obvious that the time limit for renewal of the planned tour on January 8th (In Amiensa, etc.) appears to be too close, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and calls on the New Centre to continue to use their shorts.
The association UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayroua, responded on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morina to enlist briefly the former Giscardos parties by not using any media in a short time under threat of criminal prosecution.
Herv Morin publicly announced his intention to take the UDF short by saying that François Bayro did not deserve to carry her inheritance after he left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, was to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Movement Council of the New Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Mr Hervé de Charetta (formerly Deputy-UMP now as NC) who subscribed to the property of the UDF brand because he had her registered as the first in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprieté industriale).
But on Friday night, the Committee of the Association of UDF-led friends of Françoise Bayroua, who do not intend to be allowed to stand out, stepped out of their silence and filed a formal request to the Minister and Members to stop using the short and return the property of the security mark under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised the alarming statement that you are proposing your political move + take over the UDF short, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, such as François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centrist.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your move name+Nouveau center+, with the slogan +UDF today+, the signatories also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this shortcut, the UDF Committee explains that it wants to remove all mention of the names of UDF from all promotional materials including (their) websites."
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the protection marks to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will refer to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In their letter they state that the UDF "is a full political movement in 1978" and remind that Mr. Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave 2007 to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to set up the UMP.
The movement of the New Centre does not therefore have, according to them, any right to use the short UDF (Union for the French democracy).
At the same time, it is recalled that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to set up a committee of officials to protect the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charettea is concerned, the Committee continues that "when it registered the trademark", it was not "a member of the UDF for three years", but a UMP.
In a scandalous and misleading way, he used no registration of acronym to do so on his own account.
This inaccuracies begins to turn into a criminal act, they declare, and then ironically they say to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to cast out anonymity by taking names that we do not have the right to".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
On Friday, the court in Nanterre decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to decide whether he used the state of weakness of eighty billionaires to prepare her for part of her estate, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames her.
The photographer (62 years), known by his famous photographs, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 to abuse the state of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which the penalty is stored for a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros.
This Decision confirms that there will indeed be a process in the case which can be identified as the family of the Sagittarius of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother is attacked with her daughter and is fighting for the control of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th criminal court ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, who should conduct a college of three doctors.
The successor and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to initiate such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the State representatives in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time make a statement as to whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and during which period.
I think she'll get caught up in it.
I'm going to talk to her about things. He made a statement after hearing Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As regards lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Oliver Metzner, the court's decision was welcomed.
This is an excellent report(...). The expert will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he has been manipulated (M. Banier).
It is two years that Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographers and artists who have been guilty of using her mother's disability for years to obtain billions of euros in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master's pictures.
So Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by a photographer who she considered to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to judge the legality of the case brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Mayers, the Friday judge's speech of lawyers changed for a while in the family hour of truth.
The lawyer Liliana Bettencourt submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) had sent to her notary, expressing her distrust of her husband, François Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourtová, according to the lawyer, said: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once to twice a day.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State representation in Nanterre again claimed that the complainant’s proceedings were not justified, since the supervisory judge in those days rejected her application to initiate proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Lilian Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," said the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to speak at the time of the commencement of the proceedings.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for economic intelligence development was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, he has recalled the conduct of management of large companies towards employees of companies' access to consumers before the marketing revolution: this is to ensure that employees are consistent with the "values" set out in the mountains, as was the case before, when it was necessary for consumers to impose products that came from the ideas of the main manufacturing techniques.
By becoming the center of business companies the customer compared the marketing revolution of a market acquisition strategy with the right direction...and even if authoritarian attempts to impose products different from customer preferences, they return regularly!
Passive access to employees can lead to mortal demorization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault companies is only a visible part of a much wider general phenomenon that involves mainly management frameworks.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all participating parties (...) active access and predictability" and requires the employees of a commitment that is completely in conflict with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to bring workers into the company's centre of interest as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal public opinion research.
Internal public opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that a new situation is face-to-face, the structure after various reversals is going back in favor of... what she's always doing!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, is increasing moderately with the seriousness of its own failures.
And finally, because most management workers have a simple view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of higher education for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of thought comfort, they acquire an old behavioral theory, currently revived by the "neuronists" from the United States and widely spread without greater knowledge of the scientific constitution and the media.
With the possibility of moving "packs" (sic) involving managers, he showed a recent survey by the agency Ipsos on Figaro.fr, which only establishes managers in their position of mechanical control, which is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses assumes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic perspective into all objectives and practices of management: Employees will only be able to assume obligations to the company if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the present time, this concept of motivation for employees is only being studied Motivatively functional analysis.
These studies have shown that the evaluation of their companies on the basis of pre-defined doxa, which enables them to assess, through the image that they express about the company, what they offer to achieve their life goals.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and introduce their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: "The Just War" Obama deserved praise from the right.
U.S. law welcomed Barack Obama's speech the day before in Oslo, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who first laughed at Obama's award on October 9th, this time, including Sarah Palin, praised the former presidential candidates in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the museum of the right-wing republican wing, for the U.S. Journal of Today, and added that she herself expressed the "sometimes necessary" wars in her memories that are coming out.
The war is, of course, the last thing the Americans would want to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be held there, they think.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the sending of forces on Thursday in Oslo and used an expression to explain his decision to send 30 000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, decided that the president took "very good work" to Oslo.
I think the speech was really a very good, blessed former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech to be completely historical, Gingrich declared during a talk on the radio "The Takeaway".
The former Member, whom some consider to be a potential Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was excited to see the "Lebic President" remind members of the Nobel Prize Committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not be given the prize for peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author George W. Bush, now editor of Washington Post, Obama presented a "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "worldly citizen" as always, but he "speaked as an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they have not created themselves and that they don't do too much to keep it," Gerson said.
Among few right-wing dissatisfactions are Bush's Ere, a former ambassador at the UN John Bolton, who made the speech "unique, invigorated and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, for example, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid of Barack Obama, as he justifies the use of force.
"When the war is packed into justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the middle-left press stands in favour of the President.
Although Los Angeles Times continues to consider granting Obama's peace prize as a temporary one, he has assessed his performance as an "excellent" and also for a speaker known to his talent.
A speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decision-making in dealing with conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression," says the California Journal.
Obama "declared what was needed," judged the New York Times, and marked it "for simplicity and teaching".
Road transporters: three marathons to an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas supplies.
After the three marathons, the Road Transport Committees and the TLF, the only organisation of employers that remained until the end of Friday evening, came to an agreement that ended the call for a stand and the threat that hung over the supply of Christmas supplies.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, when signing the Friday agreement, expressed "happiness" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night, the negotiators discussed on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
And yet, three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) have resigned from the meeting.
But there was a need for more than six hours of meeting that started at 11 hours to all agree and at 18 hours of signing the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "would threaten to disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text includes an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, he explained to Patrick Clos (FO).
Tonight, we give our members a command not to block, no blockage of the supply centres.
But there may be a few more resistances that are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed "the right agreement", even though it was difficult to admit the increase in high wages due to international competition".
According to him, there is an increase of 170 euros a month at the lowest wages and between 100 and 120 euros at the highest.
This is a healthy agreement and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalidation of travel costs of 3% and the report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on question 13 and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate tax" which was the subject of an amendment to the government's draft budget bill for 2009, which was voted on on Thursday night to Friday at the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on the "good" vote.
The signature enables this agreement to relate first to companies that are members of this organisation, later to the whole sector, in the case of enlargement of the Ministry of Labour.
It will be implemented "in the shortest possible time", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only detract from the disagreement between employers' organisations.
The FNTR organisation is talking about "bad trade" because EUR 100 million "has already been offered to the sector in the context of the compensation of part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport has not forced us to engage in an urgent procedure as a result of mutual analysis, but has complained to Unostra not to rediscover the raspberries during the coming Christmas season.
For the organisation of Otre, it threatens that in the next 12 months the agreement "is burying a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector".
Regional trains RER A: stopover on the weekend, the teams are not satisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest urban group transport line in France, will continue during the weekend as Friday's negotiations between the board and the management of the RATP on the second day of the season did not lead to any concrete results in the premium application.
On Saturdays and Sundays, then days of important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only drive between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will drive every other train, except this section only one train from four.
The SNCF connection will be interrupted at Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will thus be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette business houses, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP sought to secure connections with large business houses".
Link RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The route managed by RATP is from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, a two-train train was in operation at the point and virtually no combination was thrown outside the point at the time as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France made different arrangements and did not have any confusion on the grounds of succession.
So early in the morning it was at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) much less people than usual, including because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he stood up for "an hour and a half earlier to be sure he was coming in time".
The Saint-Lasare Station was not filled, the SNCF State Railway announced, so a larger number of officers and officers were expected.
RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or in Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lasare station with a subway connection.
Another valid meeting that will take place on Saturday and Sunday, which will assess the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the management that the committees have considered as "weak".
The RER Management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER and urban trains on all sides, adjustment of working hours, careers etc.
However, this does not apply to drivers who are required to receive a prize according to Thierry Garon (the Board of Directors).
In the meantime, the RATP has put forward proposals for the premium, which has aggravated the CGT by the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem while it was for passenger carriers and SNCF".
At a new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "closer review of the conditions for the performance of the call", RATP clarified the transport companies.
Which was why the experts think the company "makes fun of the weekend travellers".
In the early hours of the morning, about 150 drivers were occupied by a business committee in its Paris headquarters.
The conduct, which has so far refused any discussion during the session, therefore, in the interest of 'cooling', decided to meet.
The danger is that the conflict will spread on Tuesday to the RER B line, after Unsa and the Independent announce the post emergency.
The Committees shall apply for a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independents (Independent)) and shall be charged with aggravating working conditions on this line, which shall daily transport millions of passengers.
RER’s municipal train drivers earn 2200 to 2700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros for irregular working hours and for Sunday and holidays.
Turkey's justice has solved for the Kurdish side and this decision is having serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered a protest in the Kurdish community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the government's task, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities that threaten the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, when the majority-seven votes were required to dissolve the party, Kilic said and added that 37 parties, including her President Ahmet Turk and Mrs Aysely Tugluková, are not allowed to participate in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluková and the confiscation of the property by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP page has 21 seats in Parliament (of 500).
The leadership of the party has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political competence.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of obedience to the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is the legal political glass of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that there is no "baseline" with the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict of the court comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to restrict Kurdish support to the PKK and to end this conflict.
The DTP has confirmed that the resolution of the party could lead to a renewal of tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have been cast against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large town in the southeast, mostly Kurdish.
Police used tear grenades and watercraft, demonstrators threw Molotov's cocktails again or shot stones out of the mud.
There were about a hundred people in Istanbul, too.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk pointed out that the decision of justice is only "increasing despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurds, see chap.) by banning the party, he declared in press.
The government formed by the party removed from the Islamic movement also condemned this decision.
We're from the principle against interference.
It's okay, Taner Yildiz, the Energy Minister.
This decision is a complete reflection of the democratic proposals launched by the government, comments by Politologist Ahmet Insel.
Of course we can expect a response from the PKK, added.
On Thursday, the PKK signed up to one of the most murderous attacks on northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers in three days earlier.
Snow may come
That's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to blackmail citizens, says the head of the FES Technical Services Department.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the train techniques.
It could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
It is equipped with over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
However, the FES is acting in accordance with the exact plan.
As soon as it snows completely in Frankfurt and the temperatures are falling below zero, it will go to 20 so-called sections and, in large measure, explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firemen, urban public transport lines, walking zones and sections with climbing like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to pump a wet salt which is better held, something about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so the roads are free when the road goes to work".
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make a place for the strangers."
Only when it's not so low are there a number of incoming and connecting communications, among which are also Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is sideways and sideways.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians will be on their way, and dangerous places and crossings will be cleaned.
Most FES can't take care of all the cyclists.
There's a special service in Frankfurt that monitors from 22 to 4.30 bridges in particular, says Brauburger.
Since the ice is quickly formed on them, it will go smoothly as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
Dinosaur shell
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other massage dinosaurs: The animals were two and a half feet [2 m] tall, running after two strong rear limbs, had a thin skull with sharp, bent teeth, short front limbs with slender stripes and long tails.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth issue of Science magazine writes that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window for the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about family relationships, expansions and features of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found dozens of dinosaur bones, it's unknown for triasseds, reports a member of Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavations, the remains were collected with a total of five units.
The discovery confirms the theory of early dinosaur history.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbitta it's an unusual finding: "The fossils of the dinosaurs from the triase are very rare, most will find only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts don't share this excitement without any compensation.
Especially sensational this finding is not, but confirms some theories about early dinosaur history, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the attachment of the ancestors is most controversial.
The experts discuss, for example, when the eagles split into three of the most important development lines: the Maso-supply thermopods, which later belonged to Tyranosaurus rag, Velociroptor and also birds, the "long-term" four-supply saropods and their relatives, and the archaeologists of Ornithischia (ptacopani) to which they belonged, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapist after analysis of Nesbitta and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On Tawa Hallae, researchers have found, for example, evidence of airbags that also have offspring of bird teropodas.
Airbags make the breathing of birds more efficient than birds.
At Tawa Hallae, the legs of the feet were obviously partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airport with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative lines of huge saropods later also had airbags and light bones, this useful innovation has probably created a common front for both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America so far, scientists have said that even the first ones found out.
According to this, three development lines were split up soon and expanded from South America to all continents that then formed a single earth mass as the supercontinent of Pangea.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found the remains of two others with Tawa Hallae, not particularly close to the relatives of the therapists.
The three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
Of course, there are also disagreements.
One even older species, Silasurus, belonging to a group of the most severe dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonnon paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a painted picture together, because in South America there remained very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, while on other continents there are rare times.
As the dinosaurs have proved, from a relatively rare sideline of the plazas, they have developed into the world’s rulers of the earth during the Middle Ages, it remains a constant conflict.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying eagles and countless other sharks.
At the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while relatives died and divided the trias and juries.
The History of Success Has Not Lasted Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been mass extinctions that dinosaurs had happened to survive, but the beach didn't.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could push out competition.
The story of success didn't last forever.
About 150 million years later, another group of animals were affected by meteorite attacks, which also developed into a triacea and lived in the shadow of the day.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Vienna University or Berkeley in California are listed.
Students from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin, or Brém joined.
Police clearance of the Frankfurt Goethe University's indoor casino took care of the world's confusion.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth's universities, as well as high schools across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are collaborating with Protestant students at the Campus Westend.
In a statement written by the German and English president, "they do not approve" a police intervention.
Because there were numbered walls and works of art, university president Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building to be cleaned up by current students and lecturers last week.
Five students were injured.
The damage done to the case, the judges of the signatories, does not justify "the violent release of self-organized student training and teaching by the police command".
Cleaning is an "unacceptable intervention" in freedom of research and science.
The overriding focus on vandalism serves as an "injustice and criminalisation of protest" and distracts attention from content.
The Bureau has avoided the necessary discussions.
The rapporteurs call for the suspension of criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that most of those present did not support material injury.
Right-wing protest
The youth of the Verdi and the German Association of the Association of Associations also solidaritys with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says the secret earthly youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far defended the process of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and contain are totally unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in Aktuken Stunde (Current Hour) in Wiesbaden Country Snow.
We have an understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, the MP told the Earth's Snow for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw opposition groups SPD, Greens and Linke.
The CDU is taking painted walls for cover to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with student arguments and demands, there has been a clearup.
The link has submitted a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
Long years paid for the secret city, not available to visitors from the west.
Zeenograd, one of the ten periods of Moscow’s capital city, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded site where a secret military investigation was carried out.
Today, this period is considered to be 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres away from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are well-known micro- and nanoelectronic research and manufacturing centres.
Since September 2008, the Greengrad representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the University institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
A number of mutual visits were made and signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation" on Wednesday.
The Russian delegation led the Moscow mayor, Jurij Rosljak, and Prefect of the Greengrad, Anatoli Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt by the head planning rapporteur, Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises taking part in natural science research at a seminar in Zelenagrad.
Scientific exchange
It's a temporary scientific exchange.
It's also about economic relations.
FIZ will be able to catch up on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want orders in Germany.
Zeenograd is a residence of major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijska Electronics Group.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for military research.
Greengrad (literally translated "Green City") has received its name according to the forested hilly landscape where research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart Braid
The Stuttgart 21 dimension can't be prepared enough at all.
For the project's beneficiaries, it's simply a "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than the launch of the station, more than a monster building that will throw the main city of Bådenska-Württemberg for a decade into the desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The main stations with trains that ended in the city centre were then considered a 19th century transport-technical fossil, which acts as brakes for modern rail transport, as it took enormously long time to cross the locomotive behind the front.
Take a moment to stop, move on, so it should work.
And that's why the main station is missing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the railway station, which lies close to the midway of the trans-European railway highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is why the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with S21, although 80-year-old visas are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves knew that the start of the building in Hessen and Bavarian capital was almost unfunded.
Since the existence of modern cable trains with motor and driving vehicles on both ends, there have been no major problems with driving and driving.
However: Stuttgart begins with 21 including new ICE routes to Ulm.
They've planted it in revenge and municipal politics.
Roads cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is a taxpayer and not a state group.
Urbanist projects can be excused in another way.
There will be a new city space that - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
Traffic stations and road construction are designed for personal transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has caused enormous growth.
At that time there was no competition for cheap years.
Modern transport policies must, however, go first of all to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight cars on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to a quick step.
More importantly, S21 directly affects many other railway projects.
In Switzerland, good six billion euros were to be buried.
That's an official number.
Experts consider the real 10 to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other bridge points and narrow places on the network.
There are sixty major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of about 180 kilometers long route down the Rhine.
Since 1987 it has been built at a slow pace on this route.
There's a real need to push.
But the S21 will be like brake.
The track of the Rhine Valley will become a bottle of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the airport judgment
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Land Film if it opposes the judgment of the Hesen Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and allows it to be revised.
The CDU/FDP Coalition has entrusted experts with legal review of more than 400-page VGH judgment, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
In Kassel today, VGH argued in writing that the state would have to re-adjust the planned north-west border of Frankfurt airport in case of construction.
The permit of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as assumed by the Land Government, does not comply with the law ordered to protect the population from night noise.
Coalitions shall be decided by 4 January if a review of the judgment is required.
The opposition criticised this delay and appealed to the government representative to reconsider the revision of the Spolkov Administrative Court in Lipska.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel group called for the CDU and FDP to return to their promises regarding the nocturnal flight ban that she made before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate it as "degradation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said the Chief of Green Tarek Al-Wazir in response to the FDP "We hold our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's call, and the Land Government is trying to get to its night flights through "trafficking rights and tricks".
Precise legal control takes time.
The Coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His group's rulings to ban the night flights were never the same as the opposition.
American Banks Paying Aid
America's, uh, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
The Bank of America has paid back an average of $45 billion (approximately €30 billion) from the Tarp Savings Fund.
According to the report, CNBC is planning to pay State aid also to the Citigroup.
The constitutions want to get rid of the restriction on the acceptance of the money - the restriction on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has made an investment of $19 billion in net worth due to variable bonds.
The remaining amount was taken from its treasury, which was filled, among other things, by trade unions.
The bank manager, Kenneth Lewis, expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: Money injections helped us overcome a difficult time.
The financial institution has damaged itself at the top of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to get rid of its obligations to the State by also making money on the capital market.
CNBC informed by reference to resources that this US bank could already announce a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to express himself.
In June they paid for the aid already Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
It just went faster than expected.
The station represented the successor only two weeks after the ZDF's board of directors expelled from the office of Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender.
Yesterday night the crime tried to settle for that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF study in the capital of Berlin, was named for his favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially to prevent the process.
But the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF Lieutenant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not go through with the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 members of the jury.
The result of the vote was unknown before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he swindled at Schächter's board of directors with his proposal to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of his mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although she was expected.
The majority of the Union members of the Governing Council have already signalled several weeks before the elections that they do not want to confirm Brender at the Office.
Resistance to the chief editor was organised by Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused further suspension at the Office of the High Representative by arguing that there had been a decrease in the monitoring of the ZDF broadcast by Brender.
Thus, until shortly before the election, protests were strongly criticised for political influence on the ZDF.
The last debate involved even 35 state legislators who considered the Koch process to be anti-legislative.
It wasn't for nothing.
About
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957, in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy, and romance.
Then he worked for Southwest and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Next station: 1988 to 1990 Personal Rapporteur of the Chief Editor; 1991/92 by letter in Washington; up to 1998 by leader and moderator "Morgenmagazines"; up to 2001 by leader of the ZDF foreign policy; up to that time leading the main study of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by an expert journal of the Media Magazine journalist for the year, the season was announced to the Greens that they filed a constitutional complaint.
Love's opposition to the governing board, Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that civil society countries should change the State Treaty with the ZDF so that the personal proposals of the respondent could not be blocked by the politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude the party policies from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, advised the board of directors of the smart chess team - immediately after Brender's meeting, he strongly criticized the crime.
As a result of this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him instead of the chief executive without losing his face like Schächter, so he could be elected by the board without becoming suspicious of the party being pushed into the office.
In lateral arithmetic, Frey's not as good as left-wing liberals.
The study is free of harampadí
A partial success for students: After the year of the meeting, the Ministers of Culture finally went to school on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education, both parties agreed that it would be desirable to improve the study conditions for bakers and magistrates.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, it was agreed that the test load should be reduced: In fact, each study module should end with one test.
In addition, the workload of students should be monitored, and "real and protective measures" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify the recognition of exams between high schools in Germany and abroad.
Member States undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for baccalary and master study areas.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university principals have had words in their mouths about a better study.
They are now filled with specific content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council found that the number of tests is partly drastically reduced: "Every module will usually be completed by one test," says a 30-page report, which is usually intended to regulate the approval of the study areas.
"A significantly lower test burden," said the President of the Accreditation Council Reinhold Grimm, "is to be "stopped the wrong development that significantly reduced the stress of the study."
This is supposed to be "the intensity of the study" in the future "determining criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and contents "must be seriously checked" so that "excessly not limit students to the choice
Seminars."
Students should have "a desire for space that enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the approval of new study areas, after examination, but also for existing study areas.
You need to "recredit" every five years – however, it means that it will last until 2015 before all study sectors are reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation councils set up by the partner countries.
Ministers of Culture called on the "significant" community countries in October to act on agencies so that the full learning was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In each community country, universities and high schools have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures.
As a single country has so far pledged additional funds for further development of the Bologna Process.
Out of the money, high schools should mainly build consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen experimental and foreign offices.
This is what countries and high schools want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to give Parliament a new school law.
According to it, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
Study training should be even more flexible, to this end it should be guaranteed recognition of tests from other high schools and to facilitate the access of the magistrate.
By the end of next year, the workload of all study areas in the country should be monitored.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed the study conditions in the country.
The criticism of the resolution was also accompanied by praise.
Juso's community representation of high school groups called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future "outside closed doors" of ministers and school principals.
Not later than the post, students as individuals should "have at least spoken a word" as well.
The future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of High School Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRK was discussing a joint reform report.
According to the Committees on Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: they require a legal requirement that would allow every graduate with a baccalary title to have access to a master's study.
Secondly, community countries must ensure that for today's generation of students in the bakery sectors there will be enough places to be available tomorrow in the master's studios with the best study conditions, said a member of GEW Andreas Keller.
Member States must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on the free access to the Master's programmes.
More than a note under the spell to Hert Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." the opening line of one poem by poet Werner Söllner, who, in this twisted piece of language, thematicizes the experience with the arrival of one dissident who has gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Romanian Banát, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one of the children's bookstores, then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he taught poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant non-militarist conflict occurred last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Obviously, the persecuted and infected Söllner has left behind a statement in which, in front of his colleagues, Romanian writers, such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, acknowledges the cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Together with some of the present Söllner received a German language price in 1989.
Recruitment attempts began unoppressively, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner went on, "then someone who didn't resist enough attempts to scare security."
Writer Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time with the award of Hert Müller's Nobel Prize and its unparalleled literary arrangement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is a literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, shaken by a case that denotes the depth and hostility of the political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner isn't, at least if you can say it according to the state of knowledge today, just a beggar, but he's also a victim.
In the Acts of Security, secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and indicated a positive influence on himself by secret agent Walter.
"He was cutting me off at all the points for him," says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was in this form and was unexpected to this audience, but it is completely surprising that the former dissident's confession and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own act, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spies Security.
Touching, you can assume, they'll speculate and in some cases even probably know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and also Walter.
Unlike in a foreign country, while already a very certain view of the ingredients of the Stasi, manipulation with the rest of the security control is still very diffuse.
In recent years systematic education has been dreaming and limited.
One of the Birthler authorities, which is responsible to the National Security Council (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the publication of the Act has been more lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of files.
The fact that former members of Security still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, presented an interview in which one of the former heads of Security from Temešvár expressed his appreciation for the refusal.
He's got a psychosis. She was finally interrogated only once.
The subjugation of power was expressed in a completely undisclosed way in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in the case of a silent apology, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets us expect the continuation of this chapter to be more determined by the desire for knowledge than by the dedication of the wine and the cold.
The geneticist of Herty Müller, who took the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a note under the spell.
Saturation of Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed trade representative had come from a lovely Christmas party on which a sports product manufacturer of sweetness was placing when a quarter an hour after midnight came to class C’s invited Mercedes, the new coach VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-coloured sponsor’s bag.
A man with a brand-new dance allowed him to take another city after him.
Otherwise he could drive himself -- alcohol was not in the game, and drunk luck was a 55-year-old man too.
It was a good evening, but tomorrow he'll be back to work.
Or it's just starting.
The words just three days after Switzerland's engagement: "We've reached the eight-finals", because in the Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "we must not let ourselves be defeated by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against accession."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mohucha and the ordinary league days.
And prevent repeated obvious weaknesses after three rapid goals of Maricy (5), Tresche (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Disposal
The Osmifinal Champions League (run 16/17. + 23/24 February/judgment 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be held in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of Babbel's tragic succession will remain preserved.
Not only in the case of the supposed physician, who did not belong to the Stuttgart professionals during a short time of self-consciousness, willingness to sit and enjoy the game.
I went to the players and told them that they were going to focus on their strong pages and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the soul doctor Gross so simply a successful prescription, which, however, did not prove any effectiveness in the operation of Babella's therapist.
He blew up some magic, said Babbel's associate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes into football, sometimes things happen that you don't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a long break caused by the injury, became immediately the best player in the game, tried to describe the discovered "phenomen" by the word "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It was obviously missing for Babella.
VfB Stuttgart has not been saved yet, Sport President Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stamina.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against a weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of a Romanian guest.
They would win even in Glasgow before there came a bad wake after defeat 0:4 in Leverkus, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months was caused by the weekend events that were fresh in the form of a television conversation with singer Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that make others and not Jens, led Heldt to a strong criticism of Lehman.
He was predisposing his imagination of poor leadership and decided to change coaches after pressure from puberty.
Even that his day off after the fight was cancelled, Lehmann marked as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehman's phrase "formulates pure selfishness", Heldt said and announced the consequences for the industry.
The two forty will have no more joy in life.
In any case, they agree with others that without the work of a trained team, it would not be possible to play such a strong and warlike performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great contribution to success", said Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man agrees with the needle bag.
The World’s Heavyweight Championships
In Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world's champion Vitalie Klička.
After 12 hard wheels, however, Ukraine defended its title in the heavy weight of the WBC boxing organisation.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Klička remains the master of the world in the box in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat on Saturday at Bern American Kevin Johnson unanimously at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Click, this is the third successful title defence after his return in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to everyone who was expecting.
The call improved its balance to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice being defeated due to injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th battle.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena drove 2,02 meters high Click the match with their left primarily.
About 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced before duel the end of the Click era, but landed before the strike of the world's master, so the Click could not establish a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
All of this he did was passive Johnson on the challenger, and he was just trying to get to the next round.
The call provoked words and gestures, but the world's champion struck only a few times.
But still, it's just the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klikka full of twelve rounds.
The challenger took care of before the fight in the Swiss capital for excitement.
He insulted the Call as a "resistant zombie," which "has nothing to do with it."
During the ride on Friday, the champion let himself be provoked, pulled Johnson out of the nose of the sunglasses, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Click return
The call remained unbeatable after the fourth match after its return on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of stopping, he defeated in Berlin Nigerian Samuel Peter and took back his WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in defenses and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this fight I got only one morning and physically in good shape, I justified the call for a quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
However, the WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye after he sat on the throne of 2,13 feet [2,13 m] high by Nikolai Vulajev in November.
Haye refused the summer battle against Click, which was planned for September.
It is alleged that his promotional company is planning a fight against Click in the London Wembley Stadium.
Kundúz case
Front attack from the opposition: Chief of the Green Jürgen Trittin Group pointed out by bad information about the affair Kundúz Gutenberg's defence minister for the lie.
SPD and Linke (Levice) invite the chancellor to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent insights into Kundúz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been deliberately deceived.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously false," said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin group in the Saturday news series ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: Lhal.
The order for killing was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO had, as Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not just about the destruction of the loaded cars, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
At the US raid demanded by German commander Kunduz, Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation.
The Greens, the SPD and the Links called on Angel Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately in front of the Spolkov River and also to explain what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the strategy for the targeted killing of part of the Afghan Spolkov's policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, Bundeswehr and the rapporteur's service approved this new strategy, called for Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from Green Renate Künastová.
Ulrich Wilhelm's oral government has definitely rejected criticism.
The Office of the Chancellor has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, they also raised the question of the Ministry's view of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely of the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially it was announced that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and shut down the minister's sensitive details.
However, both senior officials reported that they had warned the Ministry of Defence of a number of reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeier Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have applied in writing for clarification of the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any response so far.
The Ministry did not make a statement on the issue on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the Committee of Inquiry on the subject, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see images and hear voices that others don't see and don't hear.
Not only mentally ill or drug addicts cross the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it's in bed, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest ideas and fantasies.
However, those who experience a state of mindlessness see and hear things that others do not see and do not hear, pay most of the time in today’s Western world as a fool or drug addict, or at least as a stranger.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in mentally ill or in drug use.
The guilt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, here and there will make sure that they fill the borders between dreams, imagination and reality.
Dreams of changed consciousness can occur in the most diverse forms, in a better case we call them visions, in worse error.
Although the originator and effect may vary, however, the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, the shaman state of blouse, psychosis and hallucination can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucination or vision will occur if the balance of the brain's neuronal transmitters - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is eliminated and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misconceptions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravitation over him has no power
The link between error and sleep has been employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity to the blouse of dreams," for Sigmund Freud was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, overcrowding, deception of meanings".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is bidimensional and cribly colourful.
Gravitation over him has no power. He behaves at the roof of the room.
It's a feeling of excitement.
He's got some bloody, red-grassed, expensive teeth behind him.
They're chasing him, digging into him with heavy, fire boots, throwing him over the wall, feeling pain all over the body.
Voice, bad voices are threatening from the wall and from the radio.
He can't bear the voices that give him and insult him anymore.
Henning T. will pull two cables out of the stereo, take them into the loop and tie it to the hook on the ceiling.
He's gonna step on one of the speakers, and he's gonna put a stick around his neck.
Jumper.
Smitch's letting go.
Learn to blow up the voice of the congregation shaking his drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!"
Today is Henningu T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychos, the last two years, the first almost 20 years ago.
They were released from LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and also is maniodepressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness. He's been married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts in psychology, he says.
Miracles are a terrible reality
Approximately one percent of people are sick at least once for the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
Acute schizophrenic psychosis can no longer be affected by the majority of internal and external worlds, they get into a confused state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or persecution illusions.
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The disabled are unable to distinguish the important from the minor, the brain cannot filter out the disruptive signals, consciousness is flooded.
Just as a dream opens a psychosis, it's a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest kinds of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychology is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic of University Clinics in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has meaning towards it.
At the same time it gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics are therefore often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not possible most of them, ghosts are terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once for a lifetime enjoy hallucinations
Unlike in the dream, Fuchss says, "But there remains a meaningful and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis, essentially maintained."
Bloody thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to cut through life is in the real framework.
The scientists are still standing in front of the argument why our brain is making such a transition.
Extraordinary conditions can lead to a short-term loss of relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be genetic properties for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the disabled have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early stages of development will result in brain damage, such as viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a puzzle as it comes to a breakdown of the neuronal system, which has not been manifested for years.
The roles also affect the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if available.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains fall apart
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view overcrowding as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and overcrowdings for ten years, and last year he interpreted his findings in the book "Die irreale Welt in our Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucination, however, is one of the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also of the surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, broken sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are also common.
It is surprisingly hallucinating under certain conditions even the brain of a healthy person.
Hallucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when parts of the brain in which sense perception is processed are too active or slightly depressed; if our brain is ingested or if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can initiate this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of incentives, stress, anxiety with love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of those questioned have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Predne Marine and going to a darker high school.
Actually, a perfectly normal girl.
If it weren't for those forms and voices.
On breaks, she may be told to kneel with her long, dark hair.
When they answer him, they look at her with surprise - no one else but her sees and hears this boy.
This brave girl thinks she's a dreamy girl, but Sarah K. doesn't, she knows.
He's up, he's hearing and he's seeing this boy, exactly the same as he's hearing and he's seeing a girl sitting next to him in the porch.
He can even feel his presence for at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
I'm crazy, she sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other overcrowds are not real and will disappear again.
In the night, the appearances are more appealing
Overloads are often heavy.
When sitting in the classroom, he cannot follow the course for how many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new companion, but he explains to all the other audiences and obviously on the table of the mathematical equation.
In the night, the sights are more appealing.
When waiting in his dark room for a sleep that comes slowly and too late, he cannot often determine whether he is awake or if he is already asleep, whether the images he sees, the grimmas, or the girls with bleeding stabs on their hands and feet appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yell at those characters.
He doesn't tell his parents and friends about it. They'd think she was crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni graduated and lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations started.
Since she's been online contacting a psychologist named Kasten, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone crazy.
Overcrowding is also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or stimulated, he will be very likely to be hallucinating, says Kasten.
I think the brain then doesn't have enough work to do and she's worried about her own fun.
Sarah K., the only one, was like a little girl afraid of other kids, often playing by herself.
Her hallucinations began when she found out in 13 that the man she's been calling her father since she thought she was not her own father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected by Sarah K. to distinguish error and reality from themselves. "Every experience", says Kasten, "plays in the brain, also reality is displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear, so it works so real."
The night dreams are also evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people does not differ essentially from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
In contrast, schizophrenics are mentally able to identify their mistakes as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The border between sleep and hallucination
In our world too focused on consciousness, an imaginary experience is unfortunately pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor of Heidelberg and head of Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinics in Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativeness - too, too, art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied a so-called one-Eided form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers to be real and does not even have the ability to distinguish them back from the alert state.
Oneroid consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular infection who are fully aware of motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps persistent, complete inability to move, replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not really possible to manage a situation, worlds change, but the real situation is present.
The intensive form of support for the meanings and the transfer of meanings into some unbearable situation that enables us to pass through our own ability to form during the moment to the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his on-Eriod experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after surgery, a heart attack with a subsequent heart transplant gave him his mind on a several - way journey, and his body was still lying on the intensive care unit.
Claussen dived into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man based on bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watches his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between the scarf that produces fake substances from the blood.
On the engine, the river takes him to its own government, on the hospital bed, surfing the firm in the Alps and meeting the Korean mob.
She's completely immersed in the imaginary event, everything's real, even later in the memories.
These internal routes for Claussen are essentially different from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories of these mental journeys are still clear after years and in minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than a real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finallys show the on-Eridic states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug bindings, as well as the fragile state of our inner image of external reality.
Any change of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "may lead to the deformation of what we say reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
In 27, they're supposed to take over the children's burden.
The new commander of Kallen is a transitional solution: For a long time Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding has to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Charger Hubert Burda sees his company for a long time in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at 27 years of age and have a strong will to enter the company, says 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We've dealt with this carefully.
The question is whether they're also active in the company is up until then.
And the question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in front of their children unless they are capable enough.
It would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had retired from the Presidency of the Representation since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the representation at Burdy since 1999.
He's got technology at his disposal first.
She later joined the company in responsibility for the company's assets and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's resignation, also Direct marketing, Cisina, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge of the loading.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Callen's appointment also serves to "exceed 10, 15 years," reported Burd.
Holding should have 100 percent family in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that no family business had any certainty before the event: "It has always happened to companies that have been infected with the desire for capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had a dream of world power, says Burd.
I don't consider myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these stores are too big.

Endesa to Barcelona, with electric car
Energetic company Endesa, together with the Barcelona Council, founded 'Officer LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital city of Catalan.
The LIVE' Office will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure agreements in the area of mobility, will establish, coordinate and submit contributions etc.
It will also develop projectMOVELE, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
In general, the aim is to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
This is three cities that the government has chosen within the framework of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The Energy Company of Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesa as regards the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts 'peace periods' in the automotive industry.
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for the "peace period".
In the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero outlined the measures that had been introduced during the year to support the car sector.
"Without a Competition Plan for the automotive sector, we would be expected today to leave, to close some of our main manufacturing companies," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire for individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace in this industry is expected to be in the future, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, it was noted that the Competition Plan, which forms part of the Integrated Car Sector Plan (IPA), determined 800 million for projects by 19 producers and 137 aid companies that mobilised investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The President explained that this investment is intended to develop new models, modernise production and current processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's action on the demand and mentioned the plan 2000E, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan has allowed a 6% reduction in the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has provided "significant increase" of entries, specifically in November of "40%".
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
Madrid will open the first International Fair of Classic Vehicles, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the engine world.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 at the Madrid Casa de Campo Glass Pavilion.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres with more than 200 foreign and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all kinds related to the engine world.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classical motors, real drawers for collectors and ruminants.
Among the participating companies will be the following:Clasicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, car repair; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and car repair; or Cochera Classicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Exterior fitness tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concentration, sports performances, testing, presentations and competitions.
Qualification tests will also be carried out for classic cars and motorcycles in a custom area outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining a sports style
The Mazda intends to show that environmental research has no negative impact on the sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as Stop-, which is a device that is currently only available with a petrol engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle performance, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seats, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The phone is also extremely soft.
With the help of tools and consoles we will conclude that Mazda continues in a Japanese trend in developing futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a marked red and blue color.
This style reminds us partly of the style that Honda Civic also presents.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sharpness of German products and specifically more sVolkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, a large storage space and regular forms should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start-up system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horse forces with a six-stage manual transmission.
This engine is a real laundromat. It is very thin, denotes reduced noise, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the requested Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a petrol engine, as it is more comfortable when driving and reducing consumption.
As regards equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment it is necessary to mention, in particular, a system for monitoring the driving lanes (RVMs), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of knowledge and stability, control of speed, internal mirror light sensitive, onboard computer with large screen, parking desks, individual air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and a wheel from 17p.
And if the equipment is not sufficient, this version has been equipped Pack Premium, for a supplement of EUR 1,500: adaptive light dual- and audio BOSE system with CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It shall specify in particular the quality of the materials used, its operation and its high level of equipment.
And also people who don't find more miles per year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a gasoline engine2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which makes21.770 euros for the luxury and 23270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Preméra'

Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, serves only for viewing mail, without being able to see a certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when his Time magazine considered it one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see her outside, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is rated at very low prices and monthly payments, less than half of the amount that applies, for example, to the iPhone data plan.
After her success, the company started offering two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other is based on long-term free data services provided, but it is necessary to pay for a six-digit fee for Peek.
FonPeek, who was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third change.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Traveling people with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or connecting the Fon) to see their mail.
The attack with roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been initiated a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly calling for a reduction in roaming tariffs so that they can be accessible for Europe as a whole, which still has no cross-cutting effect.
There is a cause for concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (is interesting that it still has a name Fon if it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are beginning to think differently and consider various offers that would compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another good example, offering download of books and other search on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is payable on purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect it to happen once in the FonPeek case, it's about the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like that Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I'll check my phone mail, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's from the consumer's point of view the best type.
It would be interesting if the system could also be used in the computer.
Color that Michelle worships
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
For Barack Obama's return to the U.S. president's office, she chose her dress and coat in this color, the same color she chose when she accompanied her at the second most important moment of her life: conveying the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow with three-fold effects - in both cases it was a classic set - dress, bag and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large stretch or glue.
At first glance it seemed that the first lady in the United States decided to follow the steps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of Michelle’s entry into the function, she used a large piece of paper in Oslo with a printing press.
Change and additions: green shoes with medium high heels, now similar model, but in gold color.
It also wears a variety of glasses: this time it's down, it's already loose hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to maternity.
Employment discrimination has increased in recent years, especially among women of younger age who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Breeding and working career of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study was attended by 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited employment opportunities for maternity reasons.
The study underlines that at the beginning of partnership there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside their home, work part-time or have no stable work, start living with their partner before, before having the first child and having more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering and motherhood are lagging behind and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years of age from the start of partnership with the partner. This figure makes 4.1 in the case of women who have committed themselves to achieving their stable employment most of their lives and therefore had to postpone partnering and children's income.
The type of appointment also has a strong influence on maternity, even though it has a minor influence on the time of the start of association with the partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is dedicated to research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of the offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
The differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in age group 35 to 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at age 25.1 p. 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to the first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education do not prefer to obtain stable employment before marriage and the birth of the first child," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger's worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal password 'Because I am behind it'.
The performer 'Joieux Noël', one of the most infamous actors at the international level, is thus added to another famous characterL'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her they joined this selected actress Evangeline Lilly ('The Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Chatter').
The French part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by significant characters:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical's partner in the Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to talk about in fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, earlier and now – met at the annual price transfer that took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.

Poker Manual Vicenta
Manuel Vicent presents thirty X-rays of writers in 'Esový poker' (Alfaguara, illustration Fernando Vicente) with whom he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in ordinary life).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but it seeks something like a core of creative personality.
The road brings excitement, and Vicent doesn't look at the lessons or the inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading aid, even when repeated reading.
I'm here to give you some sights.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, just like what I feel, but it cannot be named: the benefit of prejudice, the moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nishlist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intelligence, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humour, as if it were a stick of knife that almost killed her."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been obsessed with this woman for all thirteen years, cessopia, pleasure and adventures, which is a spiritual precept for the achievement of heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey issued in Paris in 1922 Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight peaks in the universal literature, which must be crossed from the north, from which the best horolies are often seen."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said to himself that he was the heir of the county shipyard, that he was the son of a crocodile.
In both cases it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught this man's faint call from Munich to bring his response to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running ahead of himself and calling to the future and speaking to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One time she kneeled and prayed, 'God my beloved, make me stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "In his tomb, Spencer's verses were broken out: 'After effort the dream will come,/after storm the peaceful port,/after the war of rest,/after the full life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also brought his depression into his pockets.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azals or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with neurotics whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroness: "What else happened to Martin Santos than to focus on Joyce at Baroque?
What else happened to Bennett than letting Baroque fix Faulkner's gun?
What is the matter with the Holy One except that he should be glorified for the sake of that man's glory?"
Free Aggressiveness
Last week my 70-year-old mother passed through our fourth, Fuenlabrad period, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed through the vertebrae and our dog, a cross saved from a weight of not more than six kilograms, without a single word, tied it twice and severely injured it.
Our enthusiasm is greater than that we see nothing fun about such aggression to a small and defenseless animal that was also on the guide.
And the shock of old lady after this incident, when she was in contact with these individuals, began to worry about her own safety, because such a devilish possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to the woman, the child, the old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usual quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have complained about the nearest Commission, but we doubt that it was a matter of course, and that we should not raise questions of shame, we find that these rescue murderers were Spanish nationals.
Enraged, we were forced to announce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people today when they are having trouble with defenseless animals that give us love, company and friendship.
We don't understand where the right upbringing is divided, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helm
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, as both of these subjects have been informed today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, as it is the only means by which head injury can be prevented, where appropriate, and death in the event of an accident when driving a motorcycle.
Michelin points out that this campaign is part of their obligations with regard to transport safety, which "means more than designing and producing more secure products", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose, in other words, by means of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when driving a motorcycle, under the term 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 motorcycle repair cycles will be deployed to get to the widest public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that the transport security "is a constant problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
Increased sales of light commercial vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to be remembered.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain accounted for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to the number of employers' organisations of Anfac and Ganva.
However, the positive data is better to put into quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad time for comparison and meant 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, including all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: personal car derivatives, pick up drinks, deliveries, small trucks and light trucks/cars.
And not even the clouds that hurt demand the most, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases they are financing through third parties.
Other factors such as stopping or continuing a bad economic situation should also be added to the restriction resulting from the closure of the bank's credit source.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the purchase support 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to the private individuals, it is necessary to mention the companies that operate on a small and medium-sized business directory, which intend to purchase a light-duty vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam, they again reminded us that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The sales association assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to sales calculations in passenger cars and 4x4 will fall by 19%.
The manual brake support system is already mandatory.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be with the management of the stability of ESP, the auxiliary hand brake systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light-duty vehicles, while others have set a deadline for eliminating the shortage, which is February 2011.
The aim of the EU measures is to increase the protection of pedestrians, which works in such a way that it can help prevent many strikes.
The auxiliary manual brake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system will detect when the driver is asleep.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of the Bosch car parts, one third of the drivers who had an accident did not lose their brakes before the crash and half of them did not use the full brake force.
Up to 1,100 adventures
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum braking system, reduces the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year related to pedestrians could be avoided.
The reduction in this figure will be even more marked-on-calculations would prevent one of four accidents with an impact on persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that (by radar or cameras) captures obstacles and reports them to drivers except for easy braking.
If the driver reacts, he will be helped to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the impact cannot be prevented, the device shall act as non-intensive on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors sets the plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega informed, the American producer points out that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then the governments of the individual countries in which the production works are located, can be issued with the delay of early 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that Saab’s sales decision should be taken in those days.
No wonder the Swedish government raised pressure on the American producer to make a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM provides contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars acting under the protection of the Russian Converg Group.
In case it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s Chinese assets to Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is still valid if its sale fails.
Riding with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this excellent model, the engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of the first line, the automatic landing roof was in paid hand-operated operation, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; the aluminium door, such as GT3, was further used, meaning another 15 kg less; the removal of the air-conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to the reduction of the weight by another 7 kg; after the installation of the sports seats of another 12 kg, thanks to the relief of the 19palch colloquial five kg.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and the replacement of the door arrests by textile arrests means another kilogram.
It is also offered with a two-wheel PDK transmission, one vehicle with a manually sorted six-step gearbox was tested, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many complex turns.
Its behaviour can only be qualified as inaccessible.
Reduced weight does not mean that the vehicle will not be printed to the asphalt.
On the contrary, we haven't been testing a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would also convey such security when moving in the direction, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to warm the muscles during a short drive after a necessary time until we order him a sprint, braking, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want, because of the behavior that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we're pointing our hands at the steering wheel, that's what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 sound boxer, with 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and it is possible to enhance it with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that has been used before at the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it's a dream or a recovery.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we're going through with Boxster Spyder was pretty ruined, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; however, in some turns we were attacked for lighting on the winter and summer even in the early morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the most fun on the market, as it's about something more than just modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bag Girl'
Friends Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional starlett on the tour of the 'company', the singer presents his face of the evil girl as massively as his cables Chanel.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", it's "Bag Girl".
Basconia awarded her victory in Israel
The workshop won a brilliant victory in 82-91 in its hosting at the complicated Maccabi Electra playground, despite the frequent absences of Duska Ivanovice, and thus reached the head of her group after Mirzy Teletovice’s great performance, which with eight three points was the best statement in the company (29 reviews).
Vitorie was able to replace the significant absence of Hermann, Oleson, Huertase or Micova with a large dose of planting and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circle with 16 triangles greatly contributed to the final triumph.
The front line started for the blue ones who had been placed on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicating that they attacked the Israeli society very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alawa Society decided for the internal game of Baraca and Elijah’s work, which was accepted by sanding and swallowing upon return to its original position to increase the benefit before the start of the stop (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to appear as the best in his 13-point company, although 'without six' when evaluating Splitter already indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazil.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided either in the least and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their playground, and 'by Elijah' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to the return of 'jumping' to the show (50-49).
More inappropriate
The Ivanovic members, injured, but not dead at all, needed several precise games to catch breath, and then appeared the Mirza Teletovic tower, which with three-thirds of them returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which reached locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavšti had the skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to prepare them for the merit of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep their life together from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with the Splitter excluded from the Faul Sevanovic, they did not attack and defend well, and although the Israelites approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost the first time in the season.
Wounds make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and abandoned the leadership of Group B in Eurolise in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but especially the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victories.
Malagasy did not care about Pavilion's peace and friendship or the rivals, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defenses and three three-points behind them, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, sparkled the playground with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensityUnicaja , although the local arsenal in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcice and Schortsanitis, turned score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between U.S. resistancesBeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek society began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both areas where the absence of an English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez made the company unique
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing of Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Inadvertent rebuttal
The third part was very aggressive on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite losing 19 years, proved to be overweight and even managed to offset the difference from the fight in Malaga 66-48, minute 27 that shook the leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
In spite of all the advantages I have for Unicaja thanks to the leadership and three points of Cook and the benefit of Levise left a sure hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos was proved unstoppable by the strength and overcrowding in centimeters in his zone.
Croatian brewer Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize the basket of average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja seduced and handed over the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you deposit for your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the pay that they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, searchers with the largest number of classified ads in the area of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
Tool How much should you take? calculates user fees on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form that is available on Facebook, where you need to invest professions, years of experience, age and city where the interested person wants to work.
During the week that the application works, the searcher found that the Spanish worker generally "felt badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in Great Britain and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45.226 euros per year and French 31.059, while Spain receives 24,000.
The driver also pays 34.247 euros annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, Spain is the worst paid employee's work with 11,592 euros per year; followed by the seller with 14,725 euros and the employee with 15,667 euros.
The most sought out online jobs in the last three months are drivers, semi-trailers and social workers.
Brazil sets the date of Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government set the deadline for Manuel Zelayi's stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office shall leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ́affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras City, confirmed for TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy where he is hiding since September 21.
"It is known that on 27 January after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former stater who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said phoneically.
After the elections on 29 November (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured the Brazilian embassy that it would be held until January.
However, for the same week, he tried to find shelter in Brazil.
The operation finally failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which he was trying to save by the government "de facto", chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since the last spring, when inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in the environment where the parties make decisions about the future that they do not exist on their own.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise the market was debt relief by direct acquisition of assets and indirect liquidity release in the near zero course, so that financial institutions could buy assets to dispose of them.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually completed, and without doubting their unequal liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into the conflict, as did the Spanish Central Bank with its auction last year.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we participate in the return of the risk reduction.
The mobility of the stock exchange and the differences in debt companies have again gained points, although they are still very far away from the abnormal level they achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise their private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, they push for quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have become the refuge of the chosen investors, thus widening the differentiation of the eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain had almost been hit by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction of the qualifications of the Spanish Kingdom.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useless for the silence of those at risk who have again tried to raise the awareness of those responsible for world economic policy due to the derailment of the effects of limiting the credit to employment if a new day of thanksgiving should actually be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between emigration of power in emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen it before.
The government that covers the deficit, elections and the new government is taking place.
Prodi did this in Italy after Berlusconim and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro Member State not to fulfil its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin should make the Greek government more transparent and commit its citizens to shared responsibility when it needs extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some overruns in supported positions, they would be within the range of expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the debt of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences are to be reduced and our future expansion is to be extended, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is just anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the studio services to take over their recovery scenarios and review their recovery scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it gives the Spanish economy little hope of experiencing the fulfillment of this warning.
Again it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being, "be careful, friend drivers".

President Iberdrol Ignacio Sánchez Galán intervened as the first yesterday before the Subcommission of the Parliamentary Chamber, where the energy strategy of Spain is being discussed these days over the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán submitted several comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommission at the closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol Spain, investment of EUR 50,000 million is needed by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 from this date until 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are currently in operation.
If this does not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrol is indeed of the opinion that in the next decade investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the issue is changing and performance needs to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that there is a need for new 18,000 MW, but with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who is of the opinion that the bill on a sustainable economy that has just been approved by the government, is in line with the line that the company demanded, did not want to leave alive as a royal decree to support national coal consumption, which opposes climate change policy.
In his view, "a clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "precise" measure, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to take place now, because their maturity is continuing and a stable tax framework is necessary for their commencement.
Ferrovial wins 'action' Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services, Swissport, will play the role of a preferred Irish airline airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement from which the economic deadlines have not yet expired shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation in the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures yesterday
The Association anticipates 20 million investment by 2012, of which 50% is Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to explore energy efficiency at airports and airports.
Action seeks its first road in Australia against Hochtif and Bouygues
Action is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where it is already working as an energy and water business.
The building is estimated at $1,700 million in Australian dollars (approximately €1047 million).
Her rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
A tunnel 5 kilometers long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the nearest possibility for Action to be established in this country as a construction and concession road company.
Counsellor wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to initial in English) for further development of the project in the commercial plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the mill.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach $1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and, at the last stage, three groups with significant presence in European buildings.
A group called Transcity runs Action, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first one is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second one with a residence in Italy is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
Against the Action Group is the Northern Direct group with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which went through the network, has the name LBRJV and shares in it the Australian capital Lightton (subsidiary of the construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and a prominent company specialising in the civil construction of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatisation, but it carries with it a clear difficulty to enter otherwise than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to the Asian references, the strategy of the Hochtif or Bilfinger was still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has obtained a market position through its 30 % share in Hochtief, owner of the quoted company Leighton.
Millionaire assets
The action is based on a geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector in question, where it already has a significant presence through its activities by the energy supplier and in the trade in compensation.
Among other things, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and repair compensation facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy for access to the construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground route, which is the promoter of the Brisbane Infrastructure Office, with the name Northern Link (Northern Link), is to connect the Western Road from Toowong with the road around Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce Brisbane’s congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled for the year 2010 and the start of the work for December next year.
Although this paid transition would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to design in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic milling system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this order to Hochtief
Australia continues to bring significant gains to Hochtief because yesterday it announced a government contract estimated at 154 million.
The partial ACS operates through its Leighton local branch of the national broadband network with an optical fibre cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the King George tower building project on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was just to begin and Hochtief closed sale for 129 million.
In Britain, specifically in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke will be involved in the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC was allocated a 64 million-dollar tunnel in Slovenia
Through its branch office, the FCC received an allocation of a tunnel building of 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia worth €64.5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after work on expanding the tunnel in Bosruck, Austria, by 130 million.
This way, the Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore received a commercial at Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the last two years to Ms. Rushmore for approximately three million euros a year, informing the railway company.
Mrs. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves in a competition issued by Renfe, of which four were posted to the final, including TBWA, which was responsible for the creation of advertising in the last three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
Pukuta 63 million proFrance Télécom for the suspension of competition
The French Competition Regulatory Authority imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas of the country.
According to this institution, the operator restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programmes at the end of the regulation.
This penalty was imposed by the former French monopoly and the state company has still purchased more than EUR 560 million since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto raised, because the competition authority is considered to have allowed France Télécom to commit a similar offence as in the past and has therefore been rescinded.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened up a web-based business to raise revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, trade in Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
The game in the league Champions has brought 476.4 million Madrid and Barce from the beginning
The League of Masters has become a source of revenue for these clubs since their creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have won 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in competition.
The list says Manchester United.
The list says Manchester United.
Wining the UEFA Masters League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5,362.5 million between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish) who took part since the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he's earned for participation, and the only one with AC Milan that won three times the main price.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the lost Cup of Europe in 1992 is the fifth.
The list is led by Manchester United and Monkhovský Bayern, two companies who have also counted the most money to participate in the previous League of Masters.
And yet she lost both of them with Barce.
Spain, on the other hand, is the third country that received the most money through the Champions, although it received the most titles from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by a complex process in the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, Michel Platini's body is expected to make $1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of these, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atletique Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, except for another 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There are also prizes for win (800,000 euros) and remise (400,000 for each company). Osmifnalists get three million each; eight quarter finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion will make 9 million, while the second finalist will make 5.2 million.
This is how the club will make a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for victory in the European Superintendent in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments of 337,8 million.
This money shall be divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned places.
Last year's champion will get 40% of the money allocated, second 30%, third 20% and fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61m euros for 29.9% Sos
The group of Nueva Rumas yesterday published details of the offer to buy shares with which they want to get a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 for the share that she would pay in ten years and for which she would pay interest for this deposit 1% annually.
Yesterday Sos's share ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumas will value a company of 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The invitation to tender shall be conditional upon the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez Group shall provide a period of 15 days for shareholders to notify their interest in the sale of the stock.
CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruise Mateoise confirmed that it had joined the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would be 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to maintain the edge of possible bids for the purchase and settlement of the trials of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesus and Jaime Salazars, the election of Marie Luisy Jorda was announced as the head of the internal audit.
This Decision constitutes the first woman who holds a high role in the food business.
This is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company is still subdued in the legal battle of the alleged movement of more than 230 million of the Sos company of Salazar brothers.
In fact, the possibility that Sos will discover new transfers of funds in the coming months cannot be reduced
As regards Salazars' credit, the former Council members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja) spoke yesterday before the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows options to exclude the Paternina who participated in Inversor Mer
The National Commission for the Market in Securities (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion of Inversora Mer from Federico Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority has explained that it approves this operation because it understands that its conditions are in conformity with the applicable standards and is considered to be "sufficient" content explaining the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
CNMV explained that the offer was directed towards obtaining 550,008 shares by Federica Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares could not be transferred in any way until the tender was concluded which specified that the price was determined by the Federic Paterna in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car rating
In these days storms and accidents not only make car services.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered insurance events are drawn to a service where the knower must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of labour costs and working time can be long and complex.
Calculate manually the repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and the workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of knowledge is using this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for assessing insurance events and maintenance shall be used to collect information provided to them by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain Audatex, from the American Solar Group is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of tools to assess and process information about the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the producers is not at all easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the sales director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is very hot work because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and their price fixed.
In addition, for each model "intelligent" graphic processing" is carried out, where it is possible to "run" individual parts of tourist cars.
With regard to the model with massive sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
With regard to a minority car, it may take three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information on are Porsche, but for example not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the driving park in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing databases, Audex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) working at the same time with three computer monitors.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are collected, and customers are updated every two days.
The processing of this immeasurable flow of information allows companies to make different use and supply of different products.
The most common use is focussed on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries, there are also tools for handling spare parts or for calculating the sale or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide available to inform the value of the vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With a view to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain the support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different instruments, with the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for assessing insurance events intended for the knower.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it shall also include time for the repair estimated by the manufacturer or varnish.
This instrument shall be applied as applicable for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it only a few times a month.
Then every insurance company that carries out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow for the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came from the mounting line only on the basis of the first entry number of the vehicle.
AudaGlass concentrates on vehicle glass and AudaSubbastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which enables the removal of vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analysis or finding deviations according to signs or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modeled brands have been served because of the accident or how many serious insurance events have taken place over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of tool.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for the knower and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution to damage, accident or car maintenance assessment
Gt Guia evaluation is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 employees and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and accounted for 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the internationalization process of installing the office in Paris began.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's resources 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global billing of the Solar Group (Audtex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will make 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solar Group stood at $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at $2,400 million in total.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet sale of unmanned vehicles
Last October, the Solar Group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after the insurance event.
The operation assumed a write-down of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company's capital, which could expand by 15% next year.
The objective of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the vast international market.
This valuation and purchase and sales service is provided exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance, knowledge, credit, services, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey are among the main markets.
The web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 knowers.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, cars whose number of the trailer has been removed cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be authorised to operate, even if they have been decommissioned, after the prior procedure.
Budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user will receive the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation of the budget for budget generation.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals who are more or less resistant to new techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with Internet connection is needed for use.
After identification of the model which is to be repaired, using the transport number, a real graphical display of the model will appear and the necessary spare part will then be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of the workforce, supplements or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that it is service oriented and does not include the estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it will allow for for example to choose a door and turn it around to show off the inside.
