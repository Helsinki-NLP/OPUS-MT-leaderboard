The meetings must be prepared and corrected in advance.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably fix it.
But first of all, I think we need to add something like monogamy.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Thai Bill”, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
On Friday, the official representative of the Office of the Gossovet of the Democratic Republic of the Congo said so.

China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by any and no forces, stressed by Ma Siaoguan.
TikTok hides uncomfortable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age
Image China / Reuters
China ' s TikTok social network is subject to the censorship of videocrats, which refers to the Tianian area, Tibet ' s independence or the banned Faulun religious group, says The Guardian.
The documents provided in the publication show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting the foreign policy objectives of China abroad through the annex.
Much of the violations of China's policy are under "inflammation of hatred".
In each case, TikTok has unfavourable publications in a context suitable for general rules so that the social network does not look censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system is subject to a general ban on “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the Tianianmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the "explanation of the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the names of the 20 “foreign leaders or state actors”, including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen Yn, Indian policy Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Tramp and Barak Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Pack Kin Hy, President of Indonesia Joco Vido and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as shown in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories mentioned in the document.
The first category publications are removed by the administrators of the site and may lead to the user ' s blocking.
Not too severe violations fall within the second category: such publications remain on the web, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance's representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we are using a localized approach to modernization, as well as attracting independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, according to the founder of the "Producer Centre" Ruste Bogdanov.
"Producer Centre" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials from the Producer Centre are in agreement with the members of the community, but the user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov refers.
To the question whether TikTok could speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered yes and said that he had seen such publications.
The founder of our Didgital Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no shocking content can be expressed, discriminating statements and so on."
But under these rules, any content that does not like moderators can be subjugated, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
The administrators of the community check their age with artificial intelligence: neuroseth analyzes people and determines how old they are, says Bogdanov.
If a neurosect decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBK, ByteDance opened office in Moscow in September 2019 in the territory of WeWork.

She was working directly at the workplace.
Later, it got easier, I went back to business.
But I'm so ashamed now!" said the girl to the 360 television channel.
"The Istanbul was a really strong earthquake
I can't go back so far!
But in general, I'm fine." I've shared my impressions with a politician named J. Ozgul.
The project manager of Selin noted that the mayor of the city had all the residents in the course, but she said that the citizens still felt small magnitude thrusts of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of connection immediately after the earthquake.
She reported that she could call her mother, but the Internet worked "well" and she was able to send a message through WhatsApp.

Russians warned about false bank calls
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of phone calls from frauds that replace the phone number of the bank.
This is reported by "Commersent" with reference to the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communications operators with information on more than 2.5 thousand numbers that had been called to clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement number.
Another 218 numbers have been blocked and, in 59 cases, a restriction on the use of financial services has been imposed.
The Deputy Head of the Department of Information Security told CB Artem Sichev that a wide range of Russian banks had been confronted with the replacement.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warning about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such an obligation under the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank have confirmed information on the increase in counterfeit phone numbers.
As reported in the Bilina Press Service, some of the information about the fake phones reported by the CB was incorrect: the numbers actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to a malfunction in the organization.
Artem Sichev said that the Central Bank was planning to set up a fake number base to which the liaison operator would address every challenge to check the number.
He explained that it would be necessary to amend legislation to create such a framework.

The Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stollenberg and the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelenski discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance at the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Gensex reported on this during his presentation at the Columbia University in New York.

Czegrinet noted that Greensky was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.

Barcelona blackmails Neimar
Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the transition to the French "Pari San-German".
The case was almost before the court, but the Catholics suggested that the game be settled without interference from Femida.
Otherwise, they will not return to him.
Neimar and his smart father, who is also a Brazilian agent, were focused on: under the Barsa agreement, which the game signed in 2016, he was due to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the Forvard proved to be in the PSC for a record of €222 million.
Nevertheless, he has received 22 million from Catholics and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In short, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club should pay even more for the duration of the payment.
When it became known in the capital of Catalonia about Neimar's claims, Barcelona filed a meeting complaint.
"Sine Grants" claim that the bonus was intended for the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers that the game was worth only a quarter of €40 million and requires the return of the proportion of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that, in the summer, Neimar and Bars almost agreed to return a “devious” player to the Catalonian lono.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the return of the forevard remains.
And according to Sports.Ru, referring to insidders, the lawyers of the club told the players that if the issue of financial claims was not dealt with in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of returning Brazil.
Neimar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catholics would buy him back.
Mart Laar: members of EKRE will not enter the council of the Bank of Estonia
ECRE members were not and will not be invited to the Council.
The advice of the Bank of Estonia is based on the findings of the trust of the Estonian State.
Until such time as the members of the EKRE continue to behave as they initially speak, and then they think that none of them will be invited to the Board of Directors.
"The President of the Council of the Bank of Estonia cannot apologize for the statements made by members of the Council," Laar said in an interview with Delfi, transmitting the ERR news portal.
Laar noted, however, that the Eesti Pank Council had been represented by the EKRE.
In addition to Laara, Lina Tinnisson, Kaye Kerem, Urmas Warblane, Kalev Kallo, Yaanus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Ann Listra and Rain Minka, the current seventh board consists of the Bank of Estonia.
On the proposal of Laara, two members of the council - Callo and Tinnisson - were to be replaced, and Laar proposed Anna Eesmaa (Central Party) and Ivari Padara (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wished that, instead of Yaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would take the lead.
But Laar replied that the aim of the Reform Party was to get two seats in the Council of the Bank of Estonia, in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi, to join the Council of Andres Sutt.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected Laara's proposal to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia.

Mass disorder on three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests continues to fall into separate fragments and lose political momentum.
The evidence of the very fact of “mass disorder” does not hold back, but without a political solution to bring this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The breakup of the case must be encouraging to society, but it is likely that it will leave in the extreme anger of the rapists whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved futile.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 C.E. (mass riots) - Alexei Minjaylo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and after several hours and was completely remanded: the DRC dropped the charges from him.
During the past two months, several professional communities — historians, priests, and scribes — have been arrested.

Will Phytoestrogens and Phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens has been studied poorly.
One of the most famous is the dust dust.
Phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogen are all bees (popular soybeans only), hops, lna seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot fully replace natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additions cannot be excluded.
For example, at the background of their adoption, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that there are too many analogues outside.

And he couldn't stay away!
I spent half a season at this club.
It was not the best time for results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal sufferers who have always been with the team!
It'll always remain in memory and the Munitepasov stadium, where I killed my 200th ball in my career!
"Genis" must be reborn!
He's got a great story and a great pain in the ass.
I wish them the best, and I believe that the authorities of the city will bring them back to their home club."

The hydrometer called the faithful people’s notes
There are many popular sights in Russia that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre centre, all the notes that are likely to work were checked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted in the short term.
According to Russian Hydromet centre scientist Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will really be as cool as our ancestors.
And if the sky is bright, there will be rain on the Day of Resurrection.
The second note is based on bird surveillance.
They usually talk about frogs if they're flying low, it's usually raining.

On the beaches of north-east Brazil there are unidentified oil Fridays
The oily five unknown origins were found on 99 beaches north-east of Brazil.
Pollutants have become scattered over 2,000 miles [2,000 km] of shoreline.
The reports on the first found oil Friday began to take place on the second September.
However, their number, like territorial coverage, continued to increase every day until Thursday.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the detected samples.
It turns out they're all the same, and it's about crude oil.
In the State Oil Corporation Petrobras, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, it stated that they did not correspond to the oil obtained from the locations in Brazil.
"It's a dense oil.
It may be discharged from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And she was probably in the ocean during the time," told the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the union of oil industry workers in Pernambuk and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the ban on such practices, many ships continue to waste in the open sea.
At the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the north-east, environmentalists found nine sea turtles, fully covered with oil traps.
And only two of them survived.
In the next few days, the Brazilian Environment Institute will start cleaning contaminated beaches together with Petrobras.
As long as the Institute’s specialists recommend that tourists and locals visit the oily fifth side and report on all the detected pollution.

Russians have no reason to retire - B. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvienko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient resources to make full use of the draft guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal wealth in the world is quite widespread.
Another matter is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
"I think that a large part of the population now has incomes that just give them something to increase their pension provision in the future," said B. Matvienko.
The Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the arrangements for the formation and assessment of pensions, as “the constant changes in this area have ultimately affected them”.
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we are obliged to do everything we can to improve the level of pensions, social protection of citizens.
But the steps in this direction must be smart, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," said B. Matvianko "RIA News".
The FF Chapter stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on the guaranteed pension product) is to be developed, there must be a number of basic principles, including voluntaryity, preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and responsibility of the State for the preservation of pension stockpiles.
The Ministry of Finance announced on 6 September that the draft Act on a Guaranteed Pension Product (GSP) had been approved.
Among its main elements is the voluntary arrangement for citizens to join the stockpiles system, the preservation of long-term pension stockpiles by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, business tax benefits and citizens ' tax benefits.

Sony and Disney agreed.
The right-wing owner of the picture Getty Images Image caption The news of the care of a favorite superhero from filmed Marvel caused anger among many devoted worshipers
One of the most famous comics heroes, the Human Pauk, will remain in the filmed Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures were able to agree on the rights to use it in French films.
It was known from the Sony press release that the third part of "Celveka Pauka" with Tom Holland will be screened on 16 July 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on income-sharing, which would leave a filmed Marvel.
Sony has the rights to the cinema.
She rented them for Marvel's movie, which is Disney.
As a result, Sony received the proceeds from the cinemas and Disney from the souvenirs and toys.
As it has been reported, at some point this situation ceased to exist in Disney, and the company wanted to review the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faegi said he was a coward.
Surprisingly, the journey of Spydy [Helveka-Pauka] to filmed Marvel will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
A human spider is a sign figure.
It's a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
Faegi reminded me that Sony is also creating his own cinematography, which is just around the Spider-Man.
"So it happened that he was the only superhero ever to be seen in different cinemas.
So while Sony continues to develop his own local Spydy, the future can precipitate unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, a human spider player in five movies, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account a "Wolk with Wall Street" fragment in which a hero named Leonardo de Caprio shouted, "I'm not leaving!"
Information on conflicts between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted half of the cash out of Human Pauke films, provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of making paintings.
But it didn't stop Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from filmed Marvel caused anger among many devoted worshipers.
Details of new conditions are not yet available.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have been working together for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was proportionate to the wishes of many fans [Celveka-Pauka].
We're glad we can move forward together."
The film "The Founders: Final", a united human spider, Thora, Halka and other Marvel superheroes, has become the most cassist in the history of the world's cinematographer, moving from the first place "Avatara".

The expert told us why we should quit tea in packages.
A group of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that more than ten billion microplastic particles fall in the cup in five minutes.
In the packaged drink, they can also add particles of the capillaries, said the National News Expert on the Food Safety of Elizabeth Tihonov.
According to agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the tea packaged - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be included in the package.
The mushrooms are not released at the end of the season, so they can be found in tea.
"More importantly, packages don't always include tea plants," said Tihonova.
She said that it would be better to refuse to use such a drink in favour of the tea for development sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of the packaged tea was not only in its composition but also in its production - the micro-particles heat up to high temperatures, which could lead to the release of harmful substances.
"It's best to buy pure green or black tea - at least the supplements will be in such a drink," said the expert.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As noted in the Parliament's paper, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation's Economic Policy Council, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Max Oreskin, and Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, proposing to express his position on the initiative of the Federation's actors to improve legislation on support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional relations
The Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy has compiled information from the regions on their business development and the legalization of self-employed people and the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of developing SMEs and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions has not been sufficiently established, which has led to the lack of information by the business community in all regions of the Senate's visit to regional business development programmes in the country as a whole," noted Andrei Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive formulations of regions for the legalization of self-sufficiency and the compilation of proposals and issues from regions (available for editing).
In addition to profiling ministries, the data from the regions are also sent to the heads of the regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give an impetus to entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such exchange will be to provide the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the Senator of the Parliament newspaper.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions, small and medium-sized business support programmes are being adopted and implemented successfully.
For example, the Enterprise Support Centre operates in the Vologau region, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in carrying out the certification of the finished product.
In the Ivanov area, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of one window through multifunctional centres.
In the country of Krasnodar, agricultural consumer cooperatives provide grants from the country budget.

In a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-esteemers continue to pull out of the shadow
In the opinion of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangelic area has proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “business” because it is “most suitable for the content of public service to promote self-employment of unemployed people”.
In the Ivanov area, it is considered necessary to amend to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities relating to the division and repair of housing, tax buildings, physical training.
The Brian region considers it important to strengthen the control of non-reliable dairy producers through the Mercury veterinary system.
In the Costromian and Magadanian areas, the concept of “social enterprise” and the support of social enterprise are being strengthened in the legal field.
All proposals from regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills,” Andrei Kutepov assured.

The “penalties” in Russia fell 100 times
In the RF Government it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tonnes of product were imported from the sanctions countries in the I half-year of 2019 against 3 million 442.2 thousand tonnes for the same period of 2013.
The value of the imported product decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not fallen under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, imports from the CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia and South-East Asia have been offset by increased imports.
Recall that at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the time limit for the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs which are prohibited from entering Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the time limit for the rules was still extended for one year from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The original effect of the decision on the abolition of sanctions was to produce from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine joined the list.
The Putin Decree on the Destruction of the Unlawful “Perishable” Country (food embargo products that Moscow imposed in response to the West Anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has authorized the destruction of “licensing” food in any legitimate way.
As the sanctions were maintained in the West, the FF also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council, President of the RF on the development of civil society and human rights, Michael Fedotov, had previously referred to the destruction of food, which he said had had a negative effect on human education.
In addition, in early June, Rosusulsur, with the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for use, spoke.
After that, the same recommendation was given to the Government by the Human Rights Council with the President of the FF.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food products was wrong, and we should think about how to use them when assessing quality.

According to the Moscow Investment chapter of Anastasia Petov, it will create all the conditions for the self-realization and development of children ' s talents.
The educational institution decided to call it "New View".
The project will be funded by the Moscow State Institute for International Relations of the Russian Mid-Society and the High School Economic Development Fund.
The design of a building with an area of about 10,000 “squares” is planned to begin next year.
The construction will be completed by the end of 2022, and the first students will be selected as soon as possible.
“The project provides for the establishment of a public, non-commercial educational area based on the traditions of the classical Moscow school and experimental methods”, noted the press service of Moscomstruy Invest.
In Chile, a 1 billion-euro telescope was built.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week the construction of a building dome where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) will be located was officially launched, while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project was launched.
Its total value, estimated by the ESO, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 six-point segments of 1.4 metres.
It is a huge mirror, as well as two supporting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, which will help E-ELT to get the first detailed photos of the planet outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as to search for the Earth ' s twins.
In addition, scientists are trying to use this observatory to observe the circles of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that dome construction has only been started, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing three years since the first E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was around EUR 400 million, was awarded by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
