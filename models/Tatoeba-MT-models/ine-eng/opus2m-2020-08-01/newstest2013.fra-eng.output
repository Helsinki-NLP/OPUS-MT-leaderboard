A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of persons killed by fraud.
In addition, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has taken place widely since the November 2010 elections, which will add 675 new Republican representatives to 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and evidence of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the voting periods by advance, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens who have their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirms the constitutionality of the Indian Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other States.
During the last two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to present an identity card with a photo.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card like the disease insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those who earn less than $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required identity card with a photo.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well,
Students, voters considered to be voting more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their photo ID card issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, these same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly aim at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, he found that two Hispanic voters out of three favoring the democratic party.
In addition, the Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on the day of the vote in eight States.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electorate registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% decrease in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other States to reduce the voting period by advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in anticipation were African-Americans, while only 13% of the voters in the State represented them.
He went with the Spanish.
They represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in anticipation.
On the other hand, the whites that accounted for 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in anticipation.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by democratic governors' veto.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, they were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requesting the presentation of an identity card with a photo.
However, the new rules that have been put in place will undoubtedly make exercising the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partial nature of the laws that have been voted on and see a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key States.
A report by the Brennan Centre in 2011 shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the election college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer testing: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more reluctant.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was much contamination among the witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients who have had a screening and those who have not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40 per cent of the chances of metastases are more likely if not depravity.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years old, or from 40 years old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are intolerant.
The patient must really understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer by offering him or her options, without necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by choosing, instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested for active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
In addition, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are specified.
So I recommend that I pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the for and against the APS test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would grow at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
That night is a great night for people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after leaving the cigarette, the risk of dying from a fall in half of the cancer.
The weight
Embossing and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer," one adds.
Food
The Agency also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of being affected by colorectal cancer.
Charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salaison may result in the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer development," explains one.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CCS.
While one of them found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and family backgrounds with his doctor.
"To pass a screening test, it doesn't give cancer."
The Higgs Boon Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boon created a whole emoticon, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this boon participates in the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing that this is.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's not quite sure it's good for Higgs yet.
We know without a doubt that we have an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the Higgs boon predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still no data to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume that it's good for Higgs, because the chances of cheating seem to be lies, and let's see what this is about.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally uncircuitable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it appears that it also has such a law: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantific state" - this "state" consisting of a large mode in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens named fermies, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other, the boons stir up, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be beautiful and well located in the same place at the same time.
These boons then split into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, of course) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesmons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boon would be somehow related.
These bonnets, we need to highlight here, are not all as exotic as we could believe.
In fact, if you get to read this chronicle, it's thanks to a bunch of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little like a caillolu launched into a pond.
Of this "disaster" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or of infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "force carriers" knots.
Field plus stable
It goes the same with the Higgs Boon, in this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this Boon to appear.
However, this field of Higgs is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must reach very, very high energy, a little as if it were a frozen pond with only a very large rock that could climb the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circuit ring! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all the particles, nor all the materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep himself on a frigo.
And likewise, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the others (such as the photon, tend) do not.
Now, what is it that "may bring" all these research, Mrs. Plamond?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to choose any difference between the observations and predictions of the MS.
They are also many who wish that we find them hard, because the least difference could open a door on a "new physical" and close some of the doors of the Model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for the gravity (up!) or the dark matter, which constitutes about 80% of the universe's material (up!).
But we haven't found such differences in CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these research on the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Note: At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers, in Bell Laboratories, had no doubt about the revolution that their work was about to begin.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - was seen at the start as a "labo gadget".
I'm guessing...
And then, applications can also come from all the tools around research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not entirely its original intention, now serves as "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world, and it was valued by the Nobel la physique 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die...
With his Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed shortly as a draft law is being prepared.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
The duty has tried to look more closely at it.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that robbed him had left him a two-year-old relapse.
"They had given me five years to live, I've lived seven years," he said, half a fig tree, lying in his bed at Victor-Gadbois' palliative care house, from Beloeil, where the guard arrived.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its work: an enormous weakness that prevents it from going to the toilets alone, and even eating alone.
Attangled before an appetizer breakfast, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, renouncing.
Courage, he even comes to smile, speaks to strangers who deal with him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In our lifetime, we learn that a man, he's standing there," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the child stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the ability of the person " to accept regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of several people who work in palliative care, great moments occur in the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering Victor-Gadbois' palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, "the team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer provides so-called " curatives " care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die " conscious and informed " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I no longer have any wishes in my life," she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She still expects, in the next few days, a last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers are provided with body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we're all done dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At death we will accept the provision of oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the daily.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, died during the night.
This morning, it's his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help our loved ones as much as our patients," says Nathalie Savard, Chief Care Officer.
At Victor-Gadbois' house, the days follow, but they don't look like.
At the side of a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in court, well shut up in his ears while being drunk in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," concerns Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois house come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great lack of Quebec's health care that scares several doctors specialized in palliative care of the adoption of a law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by the summits of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not sufficiently effective to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before they are accepted for euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients don't ask for death just because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists rely on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostics.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she left a trialsome chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping fighting, she told me.
Still, she told me I was done!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die are grateful to the caregivers for not accepting their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often resort to palliative sedation, which restores the patient to sleep until his or her death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
In addition, the unresolved patient will have the possibility of having this palliative seduction.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: " I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanase me," that means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a journalism fair of the Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials on the road, BTP contractors, political party fund collectors and specialists of the Italian mafia tell us every day what they know about a huge "system", combining the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafios.
A " industry " that cost very much to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system has been flowing since we took the big money," irony Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former Montréal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, by means of a substantive investigation into the abuses of road work contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had agreed only to resign.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and civil servant corruption.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, does he point out that the only transport department would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some of them refusing their instincts to reach a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two majors", he adds, hoping that it will "demonstrate the strategies behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also deals with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police officers of the "Marteau Skuade" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel des euchos" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the inflations of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town of banlieue.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that he has consumed repeatable potables in exchange for public contracts.
They are formally accused of engineers on the road to Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the committee the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For three years he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary related to the mafia that returned the money to the Montréal Union, the mayor's Gérald Tremblay party.
Mr. Zambito seeded all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals then in power.
He also agreed to organize an illegal fund collection for the former Deputy Prime Minister of Liberia, Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost-contracted deficits
In Montréal, the corruption "system" worked around.
Gilles Surprising, a former public-service engineer, told him well before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pot-wins totaling $736 000, in exchange for cash contracts with which he paid the costs.
Other road officials have admitted to fattening the potato by swallowing 30% to 40% of the invoices by extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash boxes.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November, sinking Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected members of Montreal to take out the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, it is rising against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, full of real estate boom.
70% of the money is available in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, it says that it "puts on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by forks, to stop gangrene and evaporate the falsifiers".
The process, she says, is "suffering but positive".
We're cleaning the wound, but we'd need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a guard, so we don't see any suspicious practices coming back.
Like we do the house.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "operators have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially concerned about the role of "elects in the course of the strategy", when they did not stumble into the trap!
Estimates 70% of the sale of money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he is ironic: "We were told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Québec government proposes to limit donations to $100 to the parties, but this will not change the gift, according to it: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be salt money in politics."
He proposed a complete revision of the public procurement and party financing system: "We cannot go down; go down to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable the house to be rebuilt on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story attracts the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you have taken a new range with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness as well as by the new dimension of the GSP.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I go by them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements move me to raise my level of play.
And in match, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I don't burn.
From my beginnings in the pre-forming center of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved forward by stairs.
You will therefore benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to contest very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He was escorted by associates like Claude Makele, who played the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal in League 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with hop clubs.
He has sided with big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I'd get out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the lead.
But we're still on the lookout.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word against very good European teams.
We want to finish our chicken first, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the GSP become a major European short-term club?
He's already got the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and join in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we're really looking forward to this championship title.
Last season, we haven't gone far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the skills to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media are waiting for too much of the PSG?
It is normal for us to expect a lot of us in view of what we have invested and players.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we get a 4-0 home against Troyes and we find more things to blame, it's certainly a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to put in place a game project.
A team is built with time.
We have proved in the League of Champions that we could respond here.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been able, since two seasons, to qualify for the 8th final, they've also made huge expenses!
In view of the amounts invested, you could imagine with 15 points ahead of the deck!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope in May we can have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying it.
The PSG seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's operations.
It's better to say there's a "Zlatan Dependencies."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and that he sets many goals.
He came here for this and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I had a heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me from picking up the game time.
I saw things there and I got out of there.
Today, I'm able to make good selection matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must have exemplary behaviour today.
What are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deshamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the Qualifications Group for the World.
The selector is rigid, close to the players, and inspires profit.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) rooted on October 16, Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived a match like that in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
All contrary to current currency exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling costs among stakeholders.
In addition, as is often the case in these technologies, political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded using 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning to today around a dozen dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real money or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as "credit" used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The Facebook social network has also developed this kind of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and deals with exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are both depositaries of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers of money, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a two-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on computers, and the winner, like a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file mapping, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "hatch" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular print (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes easily verify that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructible linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orpheline because the two have different prints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by up to 100 million, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also seen in each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Websites providing Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also provides information on money-laundering opportunities through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Weight players such as Wikipedia refuse such gifts.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins don't circulate.
In November, "great balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much about the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier manages his identity more and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photographer and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but 2013 could be a turnout," he predicted.
In its report, the ECB also intends to re-evaluate the various risks that are now considered to be high in the event of the success of this currency.
We're part of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
It is particularly the Afghan peasants we have punished by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armies, such as the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajiks.
Tolerable, sometimes supported by local insurgents, will be no longer when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was made in order.
Trucks and armored convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overrun by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferral on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their unrestrained progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants over the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in wanting to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They moved to businessmen, taking up government lands to re-sell them in lands to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan, receiving huge US subcontracts.
They have become disillusioned; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to take advantage of American economies will: the flow of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have sided with the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and have appreciated its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls as well as boys.
Work will need to be given to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurance of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are friends of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets that feature a modern world are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about reconciling provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, eliminating the position of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, especially during the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long ago, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been abandoned, no barrier is in place, no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been required.
The noise was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the West were only here to get rid of it.
Without the energy to treat on-site iron or copper mining, no means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to explore the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls', boys', French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "get the hearts and minds" and accomplish the task impossible to coincide with offensive aid and actions, a service of "civil-military actions" by the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, led, and led to the success of a small French NGO, numerous collective work and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, gourmets in local works, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivation.
What will we leave as a reminder, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which is very hard in these valleys often more than 2,000 metres above altitude.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, what farmers told me to do, it would be necessary to maintain in their favour a small, well-controlled, direct civilian aid.
A Constitution for the Force in Egypt
It's a new poker blow from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally confers full powers on it, it has decided to play its whole game.
On Wednesday, he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this Assembly two months to complete his work.
It was soon two years ago that Egypt was based on a provisional text, several times amended which weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persevered in his "autocratic dilemma", continuing to "tradition his word" and to "peet the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a means of bringing an end to the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way of finding popular and democratic legitimacy, while the dispute is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American Weekday Time.
Since this use of a hasty vote takes the view of the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "It is you who vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of the Islamic majority voted the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, feeling that they had not been able to express their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 replacement members were added to the harvest yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Without a surprise, it is most often unanimously that the articles have been voted on.
Comments were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constitution's pendulum was wrong.
The text, which was still voting last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, article 2 remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of charia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a reflection of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals answer, who only notices a single blow of communication.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which confers a consultative role on Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws with the Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the premiers of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are further confirmed by the fact that the next director of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulémas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Tempera Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be an ambiguity around section 220, because the terms used lend to the religious vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic case law, ndlr].
And in the future, the question could be asked about the extent to which civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very critical because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that they are significantly reduced in comparison with what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
Civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will no longer be prohibited.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider to be libertarian.
Blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article is more sensitive to the protection of women, Heba Morayef, of the Human Rights Watch, points out.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on TV last night, events were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will defil them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a salty sea await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the magnitude of Bible truth, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has held five major reasons for making you in Israel.
Go to Worship the Holy Places
Make yourselves immeasurable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptized funds" will be touched by God's Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fish was miraculous.
It is in this precise place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers traveled there on the Rue de la Suffrance or the road of Croix (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the fortress Antonia (pretoria), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the place of the Peter of the Onction and the burial.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is raised to the place where the tree was grown to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem also covers the most holy place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave them with little words accompanied by prayers that are then justified.
Travel by height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 a.m. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountain lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telephone takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m high, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski slopes are 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to live on the top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
This country covers nearly 300 museums.
I can't visit them all during one stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really value the detour.
First: the Israeli Museum near Knesset (the Parliament).
It covers the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Tel-Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are presented.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of wetting of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only Ralli Private Museum where you can admire Rodin sculptures.
There are no guides and no store of memories.
The entrance is free and gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or Memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which comes back to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Scenting stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major beach resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not drop below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year.
In fact, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, which is 417 m below sea level.
The azure colour water contains flavor and very easily retains the swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are surrealist beauty.
There is a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative wells and various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Ancientity
They are kept by the old town of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persia saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile upon you.
In Jaffa you can cross young married women who come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to march into the Roman theater, "quenching" the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourist note
If you leave for Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily interchangeable in shekels (now 1 dollar equal to 3.8 Shekels).
With regard to urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funicular.
The journey in all types of transport costs 6 shekels in common and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, unscathed fish and dishes consisting of both milk and meat.
There is a wide range of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also the humus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, soft chick balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nutritional cats that walk up the high-air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of the car parked.
These fellows like passing places and do not refuse to be regulated.
The rental of a car varies from $37 per 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry to the museum cost on average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest in the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before visas were cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"What language does Moscow go": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are arguing about what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudrs selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker must undergo a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail sales.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, the knowledge of the language will have to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will need to validate its language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russia has official language status are exempt.
Persons who have obtained prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are no longer covered by this Act.
Benefits, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of review centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Language Institute Pouchekine, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the University of Moscow State, the University of St. Petersburg State and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative was supported by members of the State Douma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will this give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, they answer the representatives of the migrant service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery to work".
Many speak about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the knowledge of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in a crowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and without paper and will have to fast between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"Ask them, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passport is taken, and they don't touch the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the migrant service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many members of Central Asian republics who want to come and earn money in Russia are confident that they not only know the language of the country in which they want to go but also write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow it would be only a viable primary education.
In fact, their families do not even have what to feed their children without talking about how to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adulthood, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel diminished and faint."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the law on language.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have a legal status.
Without statute, there will be no examination or official work as a result.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defend to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and still these language difficulties.
In addition, the cost of legalization of money: between 12 and 16 miles of rubles.
And then we can get a fake record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have registration, from where the cases of extortion are.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy from cigarettes, tea," said journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, from Tajikistan.
"Be quick, don't lie down and buy yourself a beautiful art work."
As from the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
False papers come out of a regular printer color.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the work of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is twice as expensive as the official procedure: it will cost the worker three thousand rubles.
The authorities and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is not possible to simply buy these "paper bags".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the carriers of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: the shootings at the weddings or the murder organized by Moscow's lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who died seven deaths.
The police want to ban the port of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the weapons port permit from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Douma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced to the Douma of State shortly.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by closing their visas.
An open letter appears on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demand to abandon "this foolish hardness".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, according to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a criminal lawyer and specialist for the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, for a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening the laws on civil weapons will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, today we can find any weapon in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, reports Victor Baranets, retired colonel for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the District.
Screenshot taken from a site using weapons commands
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those seized by criminals under orders.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in police stocks and those seized directly by law enforcement officials.
Illicit guns start selling from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"The certified versions indicate that some fires have been launched in order to defuse the deficit," explains the former military.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are for something.
"We see private arms factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and they run weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes handicraft, a mafia has formed and organized the supply," adds the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts evaluated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts have analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Rosstat, criminal records and public data on weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explained by researchers, come from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found "because of employees whose work is related to weapons", the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% are derived from "secret sheets".
A seller and consultant for a armory who has asked to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these clandestine dig specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a teaching unit, such as a TT gun.
We deliver it by passing the merchandise through a grill.
"He transports it in the city and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he relates.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so, when crimes are about to be elucidated, it makes a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury store "
The seller and the buyer are generally by means of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to walk.
The gun price, I got it on the spot.
Victor Baranets in Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there must also come saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American points with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Small new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schedules, according to him, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I believed in a luxury store," the military remembers.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I'm not happy to buy, we go with the forest vendor and we install a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the gun is working well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
The search engines display the sites and groups on Vkontakte where we can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any document and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," we're going to post on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthograph preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and has taken away the people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they recycle coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard about this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian legislation.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on automatic tapes.
"He receives a photo and instructions indicating where the gun is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a gun", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, you can meet without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and has taken away the people who want to buy combat weapons.
"People run on food like hungry wolves and then they recycle coal in Siberia," he says.
A 100-dollar Makarov
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to an Arms", you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term deposits by the management of these medium-sized deposits.
According to the department's official data, compared to January-October 2011, the number of these crimes decreased in Russia as a whole by 7 per cent and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extermination of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8 per cent.
United States: employees of fast-food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers pass through a cashier's job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has been mounted against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to take the width or suffocate quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left associations.
At the same time as the increase in modest wages for basic employees at Walmart and in fast-resistance chains, the organizers of the events want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a rainy rain fell on millions of people in the United States and sometimes set off sparks.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work in the world for 2.2 million people, left their position to organize strike tickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart commercializes everything: layers of hunting rifles passing through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart employees are only running at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart may sell its products on the market, particularly because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complains of difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifting trucks or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" events demanded an increase in wages, and they complained that the company's health insurance price had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For Walmart's basic salary that touches $9.5 an hour, it's a sum that he can't afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California demonstrate that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in wages to the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would make them 46 cents more.
They will only spend $12.39 in a year more than now.
Walmart's supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Monday Black" continued in the stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the following day and Walmart sold 5000 items during this period.
His cashiers made 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Dan Fogleman's spokesperson assured in an interview at the Huffington Post's left site that Walmart's "less than five" employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many others" by the organizer's union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not related to Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet installed) but McDonald's and other well-marketed restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food increases them over time, but little by little, on average its basic employees touch New York $8.90 per hour.
No one touches less than them in this town.
For me it's inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about living with this salary and sometimes feeding their children with it.
On the other hand, there are comments on the Wall Street Journal forum saying it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to eat them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 am near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, or more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also asked for trade unions to be established in the area of rapid restoration.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing the protestors of a union by brigades or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, getting rid of the fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that for specific reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The moment of protest was the meeting in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you did honestly!"
The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkers in view, including the candidate for Major Bill De Blasio's post, who said that "we all need to support the employees of the fast-resistance so that they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast-resistance sector in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not knowing that they were all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to say if this mass motion cell will make small ones.
"At the moment, we only happen to deceive the brain on average"
Recently, fans of new technologies became accustomed to seeing the increased reality through special glasses.
At the beginning, it was Google who released his current model this summer at his annual conference and in November we learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, glasses are already from the old history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked air, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Would you like to tell us in a few words what your research team is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time try to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remained at the moment at the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes at the touch screen.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead of us and see the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the control by the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, many things occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Access to information has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for the time being, is not really.
We try to change this and work on real 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is the panic: the issue of confidentiality is raised because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its nest.
For example, in order to command the devices in public places, we had a project for which we were looking at gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen?
You'd do it with the word and the gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or cannot do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual relationship.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
This may be the case with laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If you're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are good enough, which adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution must be remembered according to X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave sensors a regular delay in treatment between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone doesn't understand the extent to which this affects the interaction between man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more leaders at second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect today has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary sensor of the visible field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar flexible product in Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a day-to-day perspective of the use of increased reality technologies, mirrors are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transit" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses on the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes their strength (the personal elements are those you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents point their finger at this idea: there is no touchy feeling!
Hands don't feel anything!
How does your group respond to this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could well be the addition of touchy sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
She's perfectly recording the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrason rays directed towards a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the time being, of a breath of air on the fingers.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that affect the nervous endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Does he make him feel what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: the way to convince someone who is physically in a very small space that he is walking in an open space almost at last - we work on the concepts of racing rugs (not to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the time being, we only get to the brain on average, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertility.
The realm of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersbourgeois Avant-garde" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, to the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city's border and have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, this man rather than barbu, all of red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and linked paints.
The Kirill Miller tables always gather the crowds, whatever their location.
He is one of the land-based and philosophical Petersburg counterers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersbourgese front guard of the late 1980s and the early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and make them feel good.
He recently took in his hands an organ from Barbara and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role of his existence, philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you run the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I've chosen the red as a specialized tailor in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even in society, anything that is not gray causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
And when did you realize you were supposed to be painting?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I understood it was my way.
So the wave of old non-official painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to associate myself with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except for words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of Saint Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which served as a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohema petersbourgeois.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Black arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Black and his friends sang easy play-back songs in moving beads, among them Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group started to live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not encourage any shows prior to the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education, it was at our home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are the implications of the artistic clinic.
Our employees left as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Pearter of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not easy to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a very strong current and acuteity.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a time category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares me to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragedy falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory decoupling.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but instead we have to crack him to the trunk.
And the lie will be wiped out by the denial.
- We've seen you recently in the role of Barbara's organ player. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else can I play?
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liquefied.
Disintegration of culture is under way.
Previously, people were divided into troops, the supporters of Bohemia loved one thing, the other.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Everyone sees 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see it, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and at the end of the account it's less management, money, all desperate.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat them, not to ruin their lives.
When I was young, I caught up with the tables that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually those that we paint at the end of life.
Today, we often confuse ideas.
It is said: there is a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and lived in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it was not like this, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're missing, because there's a need for higher experts who will evaluate these experts correctly and they'll get off the road.
Currently, it is the "king of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they don't take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- For you, what is Saint Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for this.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At our house, this layer is very fine.
We have to make art the way it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange
Zoom in on the space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board are looking for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how to continue to bring our species to life in distress or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be won, that would be only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on March the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitude or on Venus orbit... in space.
We started to focus on reproductive issues in space by focusing on the flower.
A half century ago, we had experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas cultivated on orbit were in no way different from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put in orbit insects, small reproductive Drosophilic flies.
In 1979, hatching eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in a pusher.
We're getting a perfectly normal pulse at the exit.
Then the problems start.
" The problem is related to the need for the pusher to find support, to get on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Not finding any support, the pigs acted in a disorderly manner.
And at the end of 10 a.m., the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The pillows did not react to light or to sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die at the end of four days.
"We shook their eyes twice, then left them, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, discovering the failure of experience with dust in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experience will continue in spring 2013.
However, the Biosatellite " Bion " will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, we haven't discovered anything supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We need to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions can not yet be performed directly in space.
It's not a lie.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sages have abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has more precious.
Our moustache flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
" No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the shooting and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, it may be lost.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a whole-healthed offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, the heroes of the Soviet Union and the heroes of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
However, humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floatability, the cosmonauts are trained at extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the sink.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves for about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid of her mother's womb, it is easier for her to get used to water.
It is logical in principle, because from birth to first bath, it only takes two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swim instructor for babies, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who is born the child is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In a pusher, the muscles of the belly, the basin are atrophyed very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on the boot simulators.
We can certainly prepare a reception in a special room, and the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valery Poliakov to invite you to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled, totally de-adapted child," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still part of the theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will go into their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Public Finance Control Institute) said: " The control of independent pseudo work (Czech " Szvarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is at the heart of its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Financial Control Institute, said in an interview with Aktuální.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what makes us defective," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Švarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the House of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project, which compared the laws on public markets in these two countries.
What was he specifically asking?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public markets and specific national legislation, as well as a practice specifically referred to.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: in general speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality", however, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is best in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to develop ever more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project be of practical help to you, and what is the result for you?
A common control of this kind should just help us to stop trying to specify laws, reduce and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and any criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of markets, we will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It could be that this system is so submerged by paperasse that those who are looking for flaws will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
In the case of institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechungshof works there, which is also organized in a similar way, it also has a slightly different council, but these two institutions are essentially running in a similar manner.
The skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has a course of such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of Länder's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model but certainly cannot be said to do better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I have no comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider to be a model is also faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, what did the amendment of the Public Markets Act mean to you as an institution?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do post-control, we have to deal with a certain delay.
Our observations only concern, for the time being, the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "risk detection of bad management" with which we have moved to the crib nearly 14,000 public markets - where these changes will certainly be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions for certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an overload for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation regime, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) committed controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the Markets Act would mean a failure to budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful, then, to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who wish to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with so-called control of the Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Schwarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He may declare, "We are going to change the law and authorize it," but he cannot say that we are going to act as if it were nothing.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, just to protect the call for tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what makes us defective.
The roads are frozen, but most of them remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased surveillance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but also by frozen and snowy places.
Temperatures fell and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but should be slightly up to date.
Snowfalls have stopped in the region and there is only a fine snow layer in the plains.
However, the crates of the metallic mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by about 30 centimeters of snow.
There are data from the regional road maintenance service that due to the fog, visibility was reduced.
The R6 motorway and the national roads in the region are now feasible without difficulty.
However, surveillance remains to be done, for example on certain points where the coating can be frozen and smooth.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
It still remains on some of their sections of iced snow residues and by traffic-scattered places.
Especially in altitude areas, drivers need to strengthen their surveillance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of verglas and that traffic-tight snow layers can be found on the roads in mountain and altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of vertebrate training in areas in the area of Pardubice located at altitude.
There may be a glass in the vicinity of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitaviy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the departmental roads and third category.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitaviy were treated chemically.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoshe) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlicky mountain).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnu and Trutnov, a traffic-tighted snow layer is present on the roads in the altitude areas.
In eastern Bohemia, time will now be dry, most often cleared, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and + 1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although there is a need for increased monitoring and adaptation to weather conditions.
It cools this morning, temperatures rise between -3° and -9°C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, certain communication routes may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to pass through fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what comes from information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practical almost without difficulty, however, road maintenance services recommend increased surveillance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coverage of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some can be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case there is an anti-freeze guard.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Shumava region.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers in the Olomouc area at altitudes today have to rely on a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remains on the col says "Chervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to go to the ground that night; according to the road management services, it fell more than three centimeters in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most footwear can be used without difficulty.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district are snowfalls.
The drivers running in the direction of Jesseník must wait to meet the call "Chervenohorské sedlo" a layer of thick and soft snow" in ČTK today declared the head of the bus maintenance services in the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also went to work during the night; according to them, after chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, roads are easy to use, but in the Šternberk district, drivers should be careful in sections in forest areas with wet footwear.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions
As early as this morning, the North Bohemia Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult sections.
There is evidence from the police that, in addition to certain snow or verglas covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and fog should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of the central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, including around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: snow and rain during the day, clear sky and ice during the night.
There are also difficult conditions on national road 13 between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have been curved under the weight of snow until they reach the shoe.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think should be the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of these new alarms, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, it is said that we are the only group capable of collecting a balance of positive energy to resist or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you have a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable act that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential for the end of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December at 11 a.m.
On December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will practically end when the Maya calendar ends on the island of Kiribati located in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour advance time zone compared to us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymn against the end of the world, which is entitled " End of the Canceled World " (Czech " Konec weda zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we understand it at these charity concerts as well?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also meet at a given time in the context of an on-line broadcast, quite uniquely, of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the moment, Xindl X sings it also...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech biz show personalities, because we organize many charity concerts and events...
We strive to make them participate actively in these projects.
It has been found that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studio Training Centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, and for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedlikkov Institute and offer them activities that interest them and show them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to an independent new building.
Several music groups and interpreters will be on stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria do you have?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratesphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on-site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks like it first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose tools are to travel on foot, of course we also have many luggage and tool boxes....
Until everything happened more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without any problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What has been your experience so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east it is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there is still no current that a person moves alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it an evidence of giving priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
What must we do to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with heavy disabilities to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively participating in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are, rather than the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers among us.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what led you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Ládja Angelovich says, we have lost some control of the situation (sighs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union's grants, we can also make it possible to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you want to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that covers each other.
In a sense, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally mercy, it is natural ...
But mercy is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by all, that we must take into consideration.
They are people who can live a whole life and expand, provided they have the necessary means of doing so.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not just an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to repetition twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the streets for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this works the same way in each group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Un seul, Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 21 a.m. to the scheduled end of the world.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of the band The Tap Tap " End of the Canceled World " will be sung together.
The aim of the concert is to gather financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional study centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket for this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years of age, the ticket prevention is open in Bohemiaicket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of that agency, the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and had participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
Poland's road to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at Warsaw's astronomical observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his pre-war book entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold audiences and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Prize in France and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) then became a great advocate of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagandist of world fame astronautics, and his contribution has been rewarded in particular by his name being given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the Moon.
From 1925 it was built in Poland a draisin designed to be equipped with a fired engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is not clear whether the rifle should be used to push or stop the drain.
The only information known about this dress is that of the press of the day.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the shootings.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It follows from the documents retained that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photo-electric hunting rifle, drawn by the engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Raketa - torpeda poieternza i rakietobomba lotnicza" by a writer named Leviwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all drafts for use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended.
After the war, other work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystó Astronautique).
For the first time, it is a matter of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem Journal, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Sototowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautics
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the international Astronautic Federation (created in 1951) and, from fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Astronautic Federation.
It continued its function until its death in 1959.
As of 1956, the PTA has made a significant contribution to the crowned development of the RM Meteorological Fusion (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish Fusion to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rifle with a length of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Then an improved version was built, RM-1A and during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This shot was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform specific scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type rockets.
It was designed with two floors and had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of tools was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the airport, and the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Utility Act.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public opinion.
It is no doubt interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities as well as national economic systems are permanently in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free movement of private capital linked to a french financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the labour price (wage) generate tensions on prices.
The following meaning should be given to this: a producer strives to import low-sales goods to withstand economic competition by "making it more expensive" the price of the competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to transfer production abroad, or to buy at low prices, or to disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and that this is the reason for the unemployment it generates, the social burden of the State is increasing.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect ill will of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is at such a point of public awareness that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in which governments in different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own population at the expense of private capital without taking into account the collapse of society.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictation of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This has resulted in increasing poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been years of public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such salaries as the State is obliged to pay an extra to achieve the minimum vitality.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all Member States of the south of the EU are no doubt creating a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with wages of poverty, on the side of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their countries.
Here we have to ask the following question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come any more, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot invest in capital in its own economy, that the economy driven leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly advocates the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It should then be wondered whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to that question is certainly yes.
Evidence is that there is a practically omnipotent lobby and present in all States.
This has resulted in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the development of bills to industrially-related law firms.
These bills are then adopted at the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that the liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "The crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State has long been in full delicacy and the functions have been attributed to violence.
Pott-de-vine cuts, illegal benefits, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-table and corruption spread without limits, and the people went to the elections with already-sold voices" ... ... "The honest people were not seeking any office, it resulted once the state remained unconsulted for 8 months."... 'We really started to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had the Pompey spirit, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interest of the society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, a decadence without previous elites, without any effort to reform in depth.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems can be seen as a kind of break before a new step.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systematic.
The solution consists of reforms to socio-political objectives, which will strengthen investment in State capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of the private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able," says Sting in the song entitled "Fragile whose main face is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my son didn't want war, there would be no war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her deathbed in 1849.
As a result of the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some take the side of Israel, asserting their right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not lived through the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view "backside the curtain" on the one to whom they are mainly benefiting from the tensions that have lasted for more than 95 years (on the basis of the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others are based on my own understanding of it, or more precisely on the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexandre the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owe their actions to someone who directed their actions according to pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when global wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been able to do so in one generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the leper (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
It's not written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) to put an end to the linkage between their names and the serious criminal acts they had committed and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or engage in wars against countries in which they have not yet had such participation (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's 5, after the return of Kadhafi only 4, while Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status of the Bank of America of Rothschild and went on to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue cash and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, while he wanted to try a trial against the FED for triggering the big economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three-world war plan by Albert Pike, a 33th-degree freemason, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, particularly British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a number of slaves are sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and eventually acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order by chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an exacerbation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeated crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After successfully launching the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the successor of Habsburg to the Austrian-Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the death of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
To facilitate the launch of World War II, bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: they have, on the one hand, imposed faramineous war repairs on Germany, thus generating the conditions for radicalization of the apex masses (they then have to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, create a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities, including a strong German minority that was supposed to play the fifth column (which it actually does) to set fire to dust and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the basis for the massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the Arab local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially held it; or if everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in concentration camps creates the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war repairs imposed on Germany were at the origin of the second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse capable of causing a third world war.
If international bankers are able to launch this war, the Jewish population will be like it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fight, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of disagreement and chaos, not only in this country but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are clearly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where it is wrong to produce another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where, at the origin of all, is the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world?
There is a difference here between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in us, international bankers do not offer people elections except their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a facilitating politician, loyal to international bankers, who does all he can to launch a war with Iran, who could, because of his country's accession to Shanghai's cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the desert of Ormuz by which 20% of the world's oil flows (this ship's corridor is only 2 miles wide) and generate a destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is used by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all new births are implanted at birth an electronic chip making it completely controlled.
" May they compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on the hand or the front a brand of red iron, so that he can neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast nor the number of his name.
It must be understood that the person who has the right sense has the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number represents the man, and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators made up of Islamic students took over the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats in hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution to the United States, who had been supporting his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, even worsened later by the failure of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations by the Algerian government.
Their luck in the United States sparked a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and stager Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated areas, they were found in the Canadian Ambassador's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team to make repairs to a large-scale science-fiction film.
Combination of genders
The expert's plan in exfiltration Tony Mendez requires Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious production company and offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way, but also a "caper motion", the story of a successful blow, a betrayal - such as in the trilogy of Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
Ambience follows: sequences of documentary-style Tehran (sub-title sequences contain iconic photographs of the time of the events and the way in which these photos have been retransscribed into the film, there are no major differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with customary men discussing the situation around conference tables, in corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to relaunch his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected actor and his actor's game ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long-distance after the police shadow " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It's also Afleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of a place's atmosphere is one of the features that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role is "maintained" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false tour team in the Tehran Basar).
Too many actions in too many locations
The stager had to content himself with a subject that offered only a few palpitating scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It turns out very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is removed by a telephone call in America and the pursuit of the landing track is sufficiently pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness is in its dissipated nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperatives, their characters would have deserved a greater place and that they are not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is shown with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of another story, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omnipotent, he makes the case.
Rules for swallowing balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey on the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a 40 per cent quota of women for the management of large European businesses was at the root of our decision," said Právo, the organizer of this survey, Patrick Naher.
Among the absurdities mentioned are, for example, the recent European Court decision to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
People can report by the end of the year any other idea as incredible as "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The contested EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio-fuel components, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively low amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of the use of the term "tartine butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic currently imposes its banks' requests by threatening to use its veto right).
For example, the interests of pressure groups are also due to the fact that bananas in the Union should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curve".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables were imposed despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this investigation in the EU Regulation of last year according to which a warning must be given on the inflatable balloons indicating that children under 8 years of age should not be swallowed without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American survey that the balloons are, among the toys, the first cause of infant deaths by exhalation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age for blowing in fairs.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials itself is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official EU function cannot use the name "Macedonian" and should instead speak of FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Association "Let the Fair" bringing together liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server appointed in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for mushrooms in preserved and risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting that money should be paid to some countries because they did not have access to the sea and that a grant should be granted to apply for grants.
However, these ideas are not originating in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea has a problem with us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said the Minister of Agriculture of Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
It was argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of the so-called "interventionists" purchases, the State had encountered full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), which had to be used specifically to write applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "the strange regulations are rare".
If the regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the efficiency of the Union's operation and in its overall development are to be commended.
More serious, for example, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, fights in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight against which it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions in the Czech Republic.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké trážky", as regards the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only canyon alcohol products, not beet sugar, can bear the name of rum.
The official list of EU registered products is currently available in a world-famous cheese company such as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck or the Jambon de Parme, the Karlovy Vary cookies ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Carpes de Pohorëlice and the Treboň ("Pohorëlýlý a Třéboný kakr") and the Hublon de Žatec ("Zatecký chmel").
The bread d'épice de Pardubice ("Pardubicý perník") and the gâteaus called "Cornets de Horice" ("Hořicý trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm not just an amateur, Senator Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how was the idea of presenting itself to the presidential elections?
It's not about being a senator or a president who counts on me.
If everything worked out without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been pillaged in the past twenty years, that thieves are not under the glass and taxes and the age of retirement.
I didn't have the ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to make a solution for it to change.
And since I am more than forty years old and am an independent member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senate but you are quickly set up for the Château (N.d.T.: Chair).
Isn't that how you turn your back on those who chose you?
I've always said that I'm going to launch myself in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections
I then said that if I were elected senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, this is just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we go to the bar or in front of our TV station, but that we also ask all those who are trying to change.
This is added to the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
We have, for example, said about me that I am suing journalists or that I was the adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Château with as a knight the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax returns beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To that end, you have to change the law.
As President, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I put pressure on tourism activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is political: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, he is deliberately denied and this delays citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I have much more chance of obtaining the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of having the power, without categorization and participatory dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and to implement it.
Do you think you're right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is we were going ahead.
What counts for me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I also act impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without Parliament's support, you have only slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have another option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to get them to my camp in order to impose them.
If I were elected President, it would not be a problem to broadcast my request directly to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then maybe they should explain why they don't want to.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to pressure the political scene.
For example, the election of the President to direct suffrage was obtained through pressure from the public.
I'm starting to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm just trying to move things forward, and if that doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back into the private sector.
It's a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make the difference, that's why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present themselves to the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jancúra, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I supported at least the investigating journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud in the mass.
I was introduced because people are really unhappy, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did most gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Do you plan to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is pointless and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any more money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have a 25 million property in Prague, an apartment worth ten million, another 8 million apartment, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
I was told by passing, I had an Aston Martin because it was a game dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in a car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You're in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million-dollar heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I go to bed?
I've already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows well that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on it, like paying my son's English school that costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I would not submit to any election.
So you're going to continue your business to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in silence?
But this is not linked to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
I have to live with something, though.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV cabinet prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be sure, it is enough to contemplate Spijkennie and the newly built book mountain - 2 photos
"I find that this building is boring, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby at the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large neighboring company, tells us, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone on the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going to be happy in one of these ring libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a town of Dortoir that has nothing to attract to the doors of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small small concrete miniatures painted.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to resume their hands on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from Rotterdam’s MVRDV architect’s office, master diagrams of bold batons and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepted the project with its usual flag and presented it to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a reindeer on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking, disappointed and uplifting their shoulders, Maas, the front, picked up his books of choice by size to make a pyramid, and ended his reasoned speech of activists by a "common dear!"
Here's my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkennie, or, as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has a plot of land.
The building is included in a revitalization project including a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the bookstore received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the case with this small young bourgeoisie, who had nothing to offer to this day but a post-modern pedestrian zone and a seam of an arable lair, whose white facades invite to think that they cover a milkery, has enriched itself with contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkennie now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you dig the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior is completely made of glass is bright and clear, the floor in Dutch bricks and the elegant vertebrae speak unmistakably the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public banks, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the classical space configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the bookstore was well-equipped: there are offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment centre and the technical centre of the building.
A particular beauty is found in the library's black rays, which are both lambs, balustrades, and climbing ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the solid building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project to the municipality of Spijkennie, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in an agricultural company ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thickness has been used for years as a substrate in the locks and fields.
It's a good market and it's time.
The membrane finish is used for one or two seasons and can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
Above the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary coffee offers an impeccable view of the city, but also Dutch croquets and pot figs.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they especially contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecology project," Trouborst confides.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior, even the days of good weather.
The thick wooden powders mounted across from the glass facade serve as a para-soil, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are charged with the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above mentioned septic computerist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkennie.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, every citizen was invited to make a donation from his personal library.
This measure has been able to meet the gaps in the library that were not yet fully garnie (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays flow everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called "the creation of an identity" in the professional jargon.
Spijkennie wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinians to obtain observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstinence.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, however, without showing too much criticism of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain when voting on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to be defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
Thus, the Germans meet on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still struggling to find this role, but they're on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
External policy, such as in France or Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean specifically for Germans?
It shows the will to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected Germany's position towards the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention of the United Nations in its vote?
Germany first has important openings in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to distort public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is certainly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But it is a decisive element in the German strategic reflections.
Does Germany sleep in its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do they differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly demonstrating a great deal of understanding of the European position.
However, given the country's political configuration, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that real differences of opinion are not so big as they always seem.
If you observe the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiastically about Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore join a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will play a role as a locomotive in the future and will encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they have to play a role that is more marked by their independence.
Does Germany see itself as an actor of weight on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on top roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be composed with very varied neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only decreases, but at this point the EU does not fill this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're just less appreciated, it's life!

"Market protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are famous brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what really is this?
Behind this name is a trademark officially deposited in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand thus enjoys protection such that the company that bears its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, it's not sure she'd get a cause.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violation of property law in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives at my office.
Imitators need only a few additional letters to be able to record their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copying the manufacturer of sports articles, such as Puma.
Pattloch opens a classroom in which are recorded at the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the Zigna DF Puma brand, a name that the company artificially created by fitting part of the name Ermenegildo Zigna, the fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres on several floors that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: its mandate is to attack the fact that the Chinese brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are appointed.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweet, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
Financial losses and the costs of justice are estimated at millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the cost-effective products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to irradiate suspicious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports the proceedings in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period the term criticised had become "the reality of the market".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the beach because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of Sany's machine, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why the Chinese can use a symbol similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, used before a blue and white logo that reminded him of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost against Hong Kong and Singapore beachers who had reorientated the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that it had some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have passed the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of the work to an established normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing a 75% increase compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Go to the previous word
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark filing applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the head of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be true of the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each recording reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euro.
A much more costly legal battle, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illicit manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the simulator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wenzler, president of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Directorate in Munich.
The Office of the Marks had therefore rejected the objection of the Muniches.
Freudenberg has certainly gained cause from the two following instances, but the adverse party continues to fight to this day.
Caution is needed
Today, the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, trialsome and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed to the opposing party a "large sum of six euros" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see what it represents for us," Wenzler confides.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to land in Europe.
This would be the case if copyists in that region would ensure the use of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "watch is on the move".
Pattloch and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international brand law, that foreigners should "register in China as well as everything that is likely to be protected", as Wenzler says.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than those of recording.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the adverse party for the use of his own name, as explained by Wenzler.
Or we will lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: tapping, singing, helping
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland's AIDS rejoice in their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that gives far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, you tap the foot: cowboy boots, basketballs, women's socks and men's moccasins are looking for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers are amplified slowly - tall, low, tenor and soprano - and they behave, they stir and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old head of the orchestra almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are Monday night, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came from genetics in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choreographer has different words, all in a very exotic language: the toilet, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in certain regions of Swaziland.
Be Helped to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 orphans in the village of Esitnie found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per minute, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means "historic content" or "songer of praise".
No one can often speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choral repeats songs in this foreign language that she has taken to Germany to now return it to her native region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitje, which depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40 per cent of persons affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitijen, the worst disease afflicting Swaziland can be seen on a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, yet a measure that guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection of half.
More than 40% of the population in Swaziland is immune-deficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Imbongis saw above all many children in the street who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is no good prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who committed themselves to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal every day.
But almost a year later, the choral founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has taken care of almost professionally the orphans of the AIDS of Esitjeni.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ISTs include syphilis, chlamydiae and bennorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
The common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis pouchs and gale belong to parasitic ISTs.
What are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and blennorgia are often seen in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute considers that sexual contacts between men are at least four cases of syphilis on five statements in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennorgia and human papilloma virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence rate of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of Chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European reports, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25 years.
Furthermore, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has doubled in more than 10 years: the figure has risen from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess at the level of genital organs, urinary pain, whiteness, lower abdominal pain, and the appearance of buttons and glass.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes from sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
Most of the fast-disposed ISTs can be cured and the late sequels can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the gifts, but especially to the funds collected by the chorus through their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulated.
"All in all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitje," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-sufficient woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well accommodated, in one of their grandparents, for example.
The gogos, as they call old women in the hall, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcome in a safe place, in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the support of the American organization for PSI health, the association organized a HIV screening test for many inhabitants.
This is not of itself, because even though the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"The AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These State sanctions, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
However, there are condoms at every corner of the street, Annette Lennartz adds, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi's Choirists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and immerse themselves in songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people from the Black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African is a sign of recognition such that it not only produces good humor and joy, but sometimes also draws a tear to a few redout-front guard.
The bus always takes them to Esitje, where the choreists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitje, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres by flight, returning to Heidelberg, in front of these hikers who walk in the repeat room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet in continuous in the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 meters.
Water is likely to come from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have killed Mercury.
However, no one connects the discovery of water with the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other essential elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Ignorance of the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Naine Cérès.
Like Pluto, who orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Cérès is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are blue and the pink points, the most difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the universe's acquiring room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiope, at 6,500 light years.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope photographed the flaming spark of a star in the process of dying.
The bengnet circle is composed of elements that the star designs when it dies.
In the immense cloudy Trifide, 5,400 light years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope photographed this Galactic Custody Room.
The Pleiades, also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on the colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years in the constellation of Verseau.
His similarities with an earthly continent were worth the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular landscape.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope could capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and clearest photographs that the Hubble telescope took is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tent, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of the Sagittarius, at several thousand light years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trains divide the heart reading from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the premises of a cosmic carburage in the constellation of the Serpent: at 400 million light-years of Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like the technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname as "australe fire wheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the fog of the Iris, in the constellation of Cephe.
The fog is 1,400 light years old and consists of dust seeds that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was produced from optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
There you can see the circle composed of black holes that are located at 430 million light years from Earth.
The Space Telescope photographed for NASA this group of baptized galaxies Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this fog the group of young stars is the brightest of our Milky Way.
The celestial bear always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the cloud of the Rosette, are also continuously creating young stars at 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy at the bright rays and surrounded by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed mostly of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrores of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see even further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Big Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, the United States.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Grand Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter also reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is in keeping with its great light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe looking for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing to its machine's computing power.
View on the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clicks before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They would build two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of Mauna Kea's observatory that monitors the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and its mirror diameter will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire him.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as soon as possible in 2018 on board an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have, among other things, a mission to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also covers ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data have indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink daily from butter, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of worthy Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young to 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of worthy Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young to 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is of parlored romanticism.
Around the many road tour guides, the small bus cachotes along wooden hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which we don't know much, if it's not that they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and that they have a very longevity.
Term: Lerik.
The small town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the landscape of the picturesque mountain.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road has only one road.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of luck in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight decades of Talysh from the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Still having a child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şarali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more suspicious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Şarali Müslümov would he be mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man at the great age of Central Asia.
"Unsurprisingly elderly people also live in certain regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, regardless of whether there was a civil status register.
Every day, a glass of deep butter
However, it is true that people in the region of Lerik often reach a worthy age of Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the museum director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that foods rich in the calories of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of which drink a bottle of butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengeriran, a small village near the city of Lerik, living Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the whole region of the Caucasus.
She sits on the ground next to a barricade, which she beats the contents unbeatably.
Eight people live here under one roof, one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two small children are also gambading in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical glass-shaped kitchen.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his crowd they hide long strips of a dark blonde that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and they've kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," added Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small chickens.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times have been since World War II.
But it all improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of the strange propaganda in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the nation's fatherly figure, a man who, however, ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterwards.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, an amount that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva has been right for a long time: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" neglected in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival manifestations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on the charia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President does not lack words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and laymen.
Because all members of the confused and desperate opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, a doctorate at the American University of South California.
Will the judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles written in horror by the Islamic-mostly Islamic assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the caselaw is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains an interpretative issue, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal manoeuvre that results from it to apply a more stringent interpretation of the charia.
In any case, it is a thought that a newly introduced article stipulates that, with regard to all subjects relating to charia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the country's most important Islamic institution and its radiance shines across the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto lead to the exercise of judicial authority.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to punish the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, perhaps read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
Clearly, it would be just censorship.
Furthermore, no article specifically guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits insulting or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
All too doubtful is the wording that makes it clear that it is forbidden to "offensive people".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke about the damage of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in Morsi's draft which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Regained"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to cause the chariac to fall before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we are going to win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, the third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the spheres of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet cleared," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim conference called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square by precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before Cairo University.
The veiled women and the partisans of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, were scandalous: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Thair place, where it all begins, would soon have brought about a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Of course, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to allow the people to decide by the lines of leadership to be taken by the country.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process which should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts in Moubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their concept of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term has not even been pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are violations of the rules of democracy and will generate a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto left him all his powers," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protestant at the Thair Square warns: "You're hosting a monster that will no longer be able to control you."
Norway's fish: is this the most delicious fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway benefit from one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of places for an extremely smelling fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and salty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of raffisk, one of Norway's most taken.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about 3 o'clock in Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, impregnates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-salted and fermented trout in the water for a time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness settles and it gets cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw food, then you take a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time fireman who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people take advantage of small pieces of fish and pour a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer the aquarium to raffisk," Howard adds.
Drinks kill the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The raffisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in deep-sea water bars, then washed in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedes, their ancient rivers whose country was not so richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Racfisk is considered to be something of importance, a vital, although odorous, element of the past of Norway.
This is based on the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not intended to disappoint it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the incident of July 22.
The Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them was able to commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has had its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our servant, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a transcendent blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a raffisk plate at hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't want to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - everything except a low percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the lines of its stock exchange tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and make a date in the summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"Don't forget the raffisk," she added in an unsub's laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm making the queue to buy me what to eat - I've had my rakfisk dose.
In the menu, a hamburger made of wool, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of many places where we use raffisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most delicious of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a knot-papillon, surrounded by raffisk seats.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here's the point, Havard."
We hear laughs and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of water.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As the President enters Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his duties in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, he is interested in the challenges that await him and the people's expectations, which are numerous.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where bottlenecks are legal in normal time, a security barrier has been established since Monday, blocking several key roads in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential leap to become the new president of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is good, the results of the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the process of a drug war that has already cost some 60,000 people six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before the US President was elected, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that enshrines the capital. On its pre-election ground, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises are responsible for the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To join the city, you can take one of M Pena Nieto's new motorways, an important improvement has been made to these roads, once bosseled and full of crevases.
A new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change are attached to its name.
"We count on him to bring about sustainable changes," said his political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and party of M Pena Nieto, PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failure, the PRI was defeated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there are many expectations in the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects the criticisms of the opponents who reproach the new president for lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent state man and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the Paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more striking.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called on to fight drug gangs in the neighborhood, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a troubled area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered during the last two years have been found on the border of discharge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto said that he was best unable to address the problem of the murders committed against women when he was in office.
Worse still, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality face to face.
In a concrete house, typical of this delicate neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version of a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came to her, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and body stiffness had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana wears the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family refused.
The authorities treated me like I was an old bee, a troublemaker, a gossiper.
They want us to accept what they say and to stop.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his discharge on Saturday, she will shoulder a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment which Bradley Manning would have been victims of during detention.
The trial deals with Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having confiscated thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being at the root of the greatest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the U.S. Army -- had missed many occasions to complain of the ill-treatment he alleged had suffered during his military detention.
During an interview with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-inquiry -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request requiring that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, was accused of having seized thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that officers had completed after meeting Manning during his detention in Quantico's military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked questions at Manning and noted his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms, on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he had reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not state any complaints about ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had voiced concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but did not report the problems.
"They wrote "no problem" (after having addressed the concerns), and however, it did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee that had met to address the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the close monitoring of suicide risk -- for his protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to withdraw this status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Corps des Marines base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and had been evicted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been aware of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very worrying.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arajon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, because sleeping or staying away during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also stated that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he came back at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked questions to Manning about a claim reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after having been forced to sleep all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning stated that he had withdrawn from the order of his guard that he had to release his cover that could have concealed his nudity, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep late last night because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have declared to the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but that he had not done so.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that at least the judge would take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he would significantly reduce his sentence if he had to be found guilty before a court of death, a trial that should be held at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that Manning is considering blaming the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Chiefs of prosecution against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, the collision with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the heads of the prosecution are detained, he is indicting the criminal remand for life.
My Mexican-American Identical Crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexicans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicoans", the other for the "Externals".
I've been in real estate for several seconds, not knowing which file to lead me.
I grew up in the middle of California, where I was called the Mexican all my life.
It's an ethnic character, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the ground that my grandfather was born, there was no need for special qualifications or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport, and I went to the "Foreigners" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their predilection themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory in writing at the point of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
As a result, as soon as an U.S. official expresses the least criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints about the way Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbors in the Mexican press and among the elite.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for the trunk.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that of the country with the more than 35 million Mexicans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the subject of love?
There's a lot.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a given time, in our genealogical tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandfather, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, poorly trained, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good conditions, we must never lose sight of that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
Besides, we know that some of the Mexican elite in the ruling class doesn't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they think of us as being individuals of lower descent and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relations with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves at the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans are more strongly claiming their identity and Mexicans are against it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know do not have the impression of being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little bit more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want Mexicans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a wonderful country that must absolutely visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much love.
And, if we consider the inequalities in wages, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, my friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexicans still want them in the way their families have been treated.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old Querels, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood transfusion seems to indicate that such a hope is vain.
While the same foolish arguments persist as the one that began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem trapped in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
In the Arab Spring, everything was stolen in flames, whether it was wanted or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis were caught by this regional disturbance.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
However, there are every reason to think that this could help them get out of this mortal impasse.
A War That Makes No Loss or Gain
At first glance, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Even if the ceasefire granted on 21 November remains, this week's fights have strengthened the force supporters on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will argue that they have forced the Israelis to leave, even though Gaza has been a rarity.
Having killed some of its leaders and recaptured 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining land in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah Rivers, the other most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Arab world's Islamists is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full swing, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has also taken cause for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Gulf.
The members of Hamas rejoice and say that the growing Islamist is running around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its rule, passing through Syria, where the rebel Islamic tendencies can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, from the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily returned to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor who can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
During this time, Israel's hardline supporters will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was taken into custody.
The Iron Dome baptismal missile interception system proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unbreakable support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being the origin of the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under the Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Israel's rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide attacks, including through the barrier of separation that is on the West Bank, the main piece of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to spread despite their illegal international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more bellicist party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman's approach to the January 22 election, has a beautiful party.
Why do these Palestinian figurines fall apart by giving them a status?
If they led the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they head out.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will take it; but the Arab spring may change the give.
Even though Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpowers will not help the new Arab governments arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire that is desirable -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is intended to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and democracy exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains that proposed by the reasonable persons on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this journal: two states, with a assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A hope, small and short-term, is that ceasefire will give the outside people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now try to stop the movement of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchange and shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama is also interested in Israel's acceptance of negotiations.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own plan of peace.
Returning to the White House, it seems as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws on packages of neutral cigarettes have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a first world, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by the smoking of their parents.
Outside the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% of the chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia records the lowest rates of smoking in the world and while these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would relaunch the black market, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"Bad consequences will come from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
The falsifiers from China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, particularly silicone to mask the terrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the High Court of Australia.
Ha said Zico sold it to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the section of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for sellers to dissipate cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you are working on tobacco marketing and you have no more than a small glass to promote your products, the Internet is the unsurpassed place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is just a citizen who worships Marlboro cigarettes and who has been sentenced to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries have declared to WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you score the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which a photo of the mouth tumor is shown.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little daughter.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobaccoist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to arrange packages on the stands.
"Before, I needed an hour to download a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them a good time for everyone and we would have said OK, that's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a world that is constantly connected, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day at an airport waiting for a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting duty-free stores).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child commend boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, even to eat creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several kinds of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
Should we then welcome the nuisance with open arms?
Yeah.
I don't.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greek-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Board: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom rises very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they rise in the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and debated in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of combined psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After traveling through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the nuisance as an experience that is "to want to do something, but without getting into a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not doing a task that she would like to do.
With the apathy, he said, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of boredom, did he say, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a massy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Nausea can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we may think that we are bored when it comes to a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened to tapes, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard from the next room that was too high from a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said they were more upset than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or demanding task, a interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an aggregate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "as you look at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, right now, we know that when we torture or bite, these gestures, often considered as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigogate learn more and withhold more information than those who are forced to remain without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Predisposition Scale for the Night" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "For the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have the time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied incentives.
But in general, adolescents are quickly bloated.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during their homework, while 23 per cent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if today's percentages of boredom, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adultness is a period when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets, or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain found it to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology in the United States.
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-restraint, says Professor Fenske.
And "it automatically goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him anymore.
To feel at ease outside the constant drilling that generates activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way of disconnecting and appreciating arrest times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directives for the new Marijuana Act
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a university and footballer in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana bubbles and pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to compare for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low use of drugs depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were immediately classified.
Police services have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative districts have called for the acceleration of existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver suburbs to the West mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of sales of marijuana approved by the State in their neighbourhoods.
"The things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators also have no questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a license system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the date of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is desirable or not, is in progress on most of the regulations on marijuana, first of all on the use for therapeutic purposes and now on personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Liqueur Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith recognizes, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could rely," he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the licensing system will not yet exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain pending: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees adequate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales trade, especially in the Metropolitan Zone of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City of Atorney" (representative of the public ministry) would no longer continue the 21-year-olds and more who had small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop indicting people for this type of crime "in immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new justice decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, the "atorney district" (Republic Prosecutor), Ken Buck, incarnates a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with Marijuana-owned cases, mainly in order to pressure users to detoxify.
Currently, 119 persons are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to try to prosecute these people who committed a crime that was a recognized offence at the time of the facts," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to promote the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compare adults to possess limited quantities.
The representative of the county's public ministry, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all Marijuana detention cases immediately.
"I don't feel like wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado's voters supported the move, offering an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions observed in different American cities highlight the profound ambivalentity among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents people accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as the local spokesperson of the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws".
"They spent a good deal of their life pursuing the people who consumed marijuana, too, have trouble accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington are in the process of becoming a case of case law for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and representatives of the State are planning a new border of legalized sales, they look forward with concern to the federal government's directives, which still design the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will resign.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and vendors, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are probably not going to knock down the doors to catch small bags of drugs, there is strong evidence that they are opposed to the approved sales of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser of Obama's administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Shortly before the vote, some local authorities approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even though this was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the State.
Many questions arise.
Petroella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory (conservatory).
It is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was an excellent place for me to know, a sort of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates both pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disappointed.
The Standard Event newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with a faety that I was gone after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I ran away because I was a victim of intimidation and was the subject of constant harassment.
Not because of my different name, not because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this so-called berth, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sad father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why do you say that today? You'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffers from the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is like last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the student room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative from the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to be able to express their views freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonder Country: Young, Smart and Right"), devoted to politics among students, and which identified the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (UCA), who moves to Rolls-Royce, builds a full silver and moves with a chromed cane.
In other universities, conservative students are said to be treated as emitters of the introduction of increased school costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservation Association, said in a Sunday newspaper "that there is a left-wing party growing in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, studying history at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OCA, says that there was a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members with respect to people who are centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about it during my first weeks in Oxford.
I went in in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and a paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was in charge of Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcoming week, when the new students got acquainted with the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that not only did the professors participate in sarcasm against the Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on child abuse, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were recorded in the classrooms.
The first sarcasm to which I was victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a cheeky face, carried himself easily.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he said with an angry tone.
I'm back in my room, uncomfortable.
During dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said, politely.
I'm very afraid he'll be like that.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is taken for a target.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youth claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, in the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with all that Mrs Thatcher said.
This strategy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have resumed the refrigeration.
I was a pervert, you know.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I just live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I become a Labourer and renege on my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was counseling thatcher's foreign policy and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professor's position at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started making the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dream bells.
Even my communist friends had irrevocable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's for you to touch.
That would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another professor of history suggested the world's most serious, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
I have admitted myself to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and "old crazy" treatment.
The repetition was short-lived.
It's my father who slammed the last key of my oxfordian circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed on tape in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers left.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with pleurnichard wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also benefited from an unmistakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian tailors.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The tailor recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of high sewing created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ point of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr. Garavani", but which could not have been written without its famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Cantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest tailor of the town of Voghera, north of Italy, to the icon of the international jet set.
There's nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
"At least, they don't write their cigarette bubbles on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular guest and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past-time beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charm of the tailor.
A few years ago, after a show on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," he recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"It will never become fashionable, because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobless Line Show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves well-known people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the mannequins place and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dreams bearing the main creations of Valentino, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Night", or a wool coat and fur belonging to Emperor Farah Diba.
Among these peoples are Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the tailor in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentine's first clothes are like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" gilt and a dress from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor's museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Feria shower.
I like the colors he uses, they're bright and they shine the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she brought a Valentine's model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening clothes...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentine for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Linene.
It was a red evening dress, with a flyer's jacket, a draped basket and a decoy to fall.
"It was a dream that became a reality," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with time-consuming," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the tailor's night clothes with "the greatest care, because a night's clothing is not only a dress, it's also all the memories she carries".
The "king" of the fashion
The great end of the exhibition by Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress during her wedding with Paul de Grece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girlfriends" (the tailor calls his tailors) to make this dress in Ivorian silk with incrustations of pearls, twelve kinds of different teeth and a four-and-a-half-metre train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high cost of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnoble for years by the "sovereignness" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Laboro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated by the Legion d'honeur, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his well-being and perfect look have always come to my mind," says Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was impeccable, years had no effect on it."
If it's a princess who says...
The world's hardest job: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the broken stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their lives by bringing the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian Java Island.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas coming from the ground drains solidify into contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the broken paths.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters of altitude, but the worn-out carriers put more than 40 minutes to record this distance, at a tortoise, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a fake could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents of euro for each kilo of extracted sulphur.
Once above, it breaks down a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were animals of the circus, and with painfully carrying heavy cargoes, they walk 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little in contravention of 1,850 metres of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry as this miner is very present in everyday life and is used to make bubbles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who generally makes three trips per day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a surhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of the minors is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.20) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167)," says the porter who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the work was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as undisputed as the suffering: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Then suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life exposing the danger on the Kawah len, but the sulphur has already begun to pay him the bill, although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Then suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French" he promises in more than acceptable English.
Misleaded by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent guide could be a tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unsanitary wood mass with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur doesn't stop jolting at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and bright in the middle of the darkness.
Defending the darkness, Then went down into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 wearers load the suffrage trays on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company did not mechanize the extraction of the sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their behalf and are paid to the weight.
In addition, they also do not touch one under 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.50) of magnifying by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old corporate wearer who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the minors in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so tough that no one complains of severe diseases... to which their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knees pain and shoulders are obviously added, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions pulled 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to Tamansari's warehouse, 18 kilometers from there through a goat's path invaded by the bad grass.
"I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life," says Unainik by opening her mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The older of his five children, aged 30, also works as a copper carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetuity of generation in generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one that makes the human mussels of the Kawah len volcano.
Singapore Search for Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans are responsible for the absence of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem immeasurable that these words come from advertising for menth pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread as a powder train on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polykine in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would fulfill their "national duty".
It is intended only on the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme we should address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they did not necessarily work.
So we say the following thing: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little to do with it.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and strict social control.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, considered as the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the constitution of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have helped to increase the number of singles and delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created a feeling within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with a narrowly-tested xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unforeseen consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, fiscal income, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as a shoebox, which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters who want to build large families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger size.
That's why it's much more profitable for our treasure.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to the promoters, who were put in front of the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small homes in a project.
too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
As long as these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people give it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time," another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private off-line is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life which we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for at least 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself by spreading on the Internet events that he would certainly not share off-line?
The newspaper ElPeriodico interviewed five young boys between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent screen users.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "the password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not disclose my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would make the fool," he said.
The young boy recognized that it was wrong to publish obscenous photos, desecrated persons, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
In part, her mother knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"The social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"That doesn't bother me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one has made any progress or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I'd just delete them from my account," he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberharcly are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was picked up on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was" assures him.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post knowledge photos in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyber-hark," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed," she says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who must teach them there, while we ourselves are learning," she said.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what to disclose, publish or say to an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think about them.
"They say don't do it at all," she says.
Then Porras cites some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every minute?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do online.
Those are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Esturado Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, states that it is essential that parents consciously read the terms of use of social networks.
By including each term, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they do not need to speak to strangers.
Unasur's summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, although it had been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 current deputies.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unassur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be released after the close of the summit and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
Access by journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that was circulating among journalists was reported by the press attachments of some of the Unasur governments that attended your meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only paper released during the day was the list of the presidents present, which caused a certain malaise among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd South American Summit of the Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested by the press, it did not disseminate the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the availability of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which runs a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at your regional meeting and stated that they would respect the IJC's decision to hear the complainants from both sides in the trial that Lima tried against Santiago and that began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are having today before this international court," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
" Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country in accordance with international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," President Pinyera added by handing out a hand to President Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit itself to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be a serious mistake.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
He read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project action lines had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of Unasur would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He reported that actions would be put in place to improve “cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to drugs, access to the Internet at low prices throughout South America, and to assess the risks of natural disasters jointly and effectively.”
With a crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should help to increase our productive matrix and create a better future for our people," said President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian President said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the cross-roads of its territory, from coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the country's electoral process will allow it to be reintegrated into the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he was hoping to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico to discuss peacefully the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will call for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," President Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to attend the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the United Nations, although the latter is suspended.
Peru ensures the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should be an example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the United Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State TV, Peru, that Europeans "were interviewed during World War II" and other conflicts, "but they were now almost a country".
In this regard, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unassur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive areas that we want to have in the past" he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President was in favour of the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, for he has not betrayed his principles himself, but has, on the contrary, respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that its case would not be respected".
In addition, he criticises the Swedish justice that demanded that he submit himself to an interrogation on a alleged sexual offence in his territory, while "Swedish legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, which could have been done since the Ambassador of Ecuador to London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health was deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates because he is trapped in a small space without being able to exercise freely.
"This is about anyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the award of an alternative conduct that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is between the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stresses that he has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the nursing of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there were permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures with various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain agreed to save conduct from tomorrow, that would end".
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or would question him through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocrit, evil faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil or evil political men, but the bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
Under this angle, he was pleased that it was not this kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and to trace the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should stand firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempted coup d'état" because, in fact, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
What is more, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the Hague International Court of Justice, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to advance together.
They need to be solved together to get past them and get ahead of them.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders that opposed Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "beneficial that Latin America would seize international bodies if both countries agreed to accept a judgment so firmly as to be true".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, he noted that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa ensured that if he lost the early February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved by means of political power.
"My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential mandate and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we never forgive, I will.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a rejection of President Chavez's health status," he commented.
The Heads of State of Ecuador have today participated in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur), which has ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the result of the test: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it and his passion was as he had just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients in Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmatism.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided telling him to say "because he was without a voice".
At the time, having AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exploited" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at an appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit head Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he claims that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectionologist and expert Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system assignment that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reached a CD4 rate of 5004.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who receives a 25-year positive HIV diagnosis, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years," the researcher explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, we need to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
While mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (as reported in the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients identified on the national database have died since the AIDS outbreak.
Nothing but in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there any more deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In at least the last 12 years, we've never missed medication, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is necessary to carry out earlier diagnostics and, for this, to offer mass screening tests to all those requesting it."
The specialists and members of the Jalisco AIDS Prevention Council (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that despite his youth, he was already a AIDS keeper and was suffering from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Any change when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I wake up three times a week," they say, that's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid of today, during the World AIDS Day march.
If they do the test, if they take risks, the sooner they will know if they are seropositive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest residence in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms before we were given one or two, now we are given hundreds of packages, it is very good, but as a result, some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, assure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold to counters but be found in distributors of public toilets and in places attended by young people.
It's not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it any more to pay their girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not like sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to already sexually active people," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
Cumulative 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) were reviewed.
The State is the 4th State of the country in many of the new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminants are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario leads to a bad precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighbouring country and with insolvency problems.
It would therefore appear that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the star flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the coup d'état rendered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Failits for the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican companies without defence in view of the possibility of enbarging their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will enable Mexico's main glass manufacturer to arrest the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register under the United States bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, which sits in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing cooperation in international proceedings in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-society vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial failure, the debts contracted by branches of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are a half a dozen examples here, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Commercial Debate.
In addition, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in all ways the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "valuable" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data missed by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without halting the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For now, the González Sada family will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The appeal will require non-performance and requires a higher court to review the proceedings, in which case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the curiae friend ("friend of the Court") in which it was detailed in the proceedings followed by Vitro under the Trade Faults Act, noting that this would release him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring him to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Faults Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two sides: they take Vitro and they take over the country.
General balance
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the company's former patron, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been kept silent for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, and the Association of Aeropilots has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is accused of obstruction to justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically refused to provide information to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from F/589 from bank IXE 198 million pounds on behalf of Mexicoana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're watching Dragon Mart
Meetings at the end of the week in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge center of sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South East to oppose the monumental project that is in part on protected areas and represents the greatest of all the threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a request from the Senate to explain the terms and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Contraface Trade Agreement, known as ACTA's English-language, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was considered to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is all my life"
The basketball balloon "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage does not condemn him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, which is as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
"I've been wearing several basketball helmets all my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes on a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his route out of standard, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he most loves are those who remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or team manager.
"That was my best years, the ones I've enjoyed most because I've had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has led to many years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead in the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been leading here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a player cost you two meters.
Do you want it?"
It's like starting Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gauss, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gauss was going to help us try and win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gaussian, but only at a distance since he was already the great manipulator of the federation in 1988.
At that time, he would prefer to take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the World of 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not given us the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as was the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Cuban Pan-American Games in 1991, when we won gold and that we put a link to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that had won bronze during the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the world of 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter in place of the players suspended by the imbroglio of the American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt it's Piculin Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his route in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Ariel does.
For you, what is your greatest success within the federation?
It was part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys play only in their area and face only teams from the other corners of the island at national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch videos from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my little kids and, from time to time, I watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been on my side.
Actor Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for John Ross Ewing's leading role, known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he was incarcerated by a man of business without scrupulous, reroutable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnet without scrupulous J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had come back this year in J.R's role in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a family communiqué sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., "Dallas" production house.
"Larry was back in his hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on that Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted her husband's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, declared her press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and lived a deep life," said Gray in a communiqué.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and was diagnosed with a fungi.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had been introduced to television in the role of an ordinary type in the "Jinny of my dreams" series broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought it back to him.
He also played in two comedies that remained in the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the film are the roles well received by the critic in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was through his masterful interpretation of the deliciously hated J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The drama series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their relatives was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in pairs.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at this time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made Dallas the second most popular entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s beautiful sister, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had pulled him over.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfied man but with charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and a unfaithful wife who tried to seduce her alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as epithepa for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as well as a man "great, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of each and every one of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT chain.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the chain has been informed.
For now, neither Warner nor the TNT chain have communicated how the death of Hagman will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who is famous for classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the New York theatre stage in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where they live for many celebrities.
In 2001, he entitled his memories "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s impeccable memories)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or hurt him in any way," he said to the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor militant and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the concerned patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to work and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay."
He was also campaigning against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when religious professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistable hammer there: the end of the "great discount" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, to which many refer as proof of the end of the coming world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what was expected of him during the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax failure that some have nicknamed "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theologians of the end of time thought that the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," said Professor Charmé to his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we were reporting it, that was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vucker awarded the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios leads to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vucker.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of History of Art and Anthropology, made a team to give a course, simply called "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "necessary disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be carried out the wake of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students of other choices than to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, on the part of people who asked if there was still room.
For their part, students ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I am delighted to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgeid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursery, says he's seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students questioned, and even less a teacher, told us not to believe in the end date of the 21 December world.
"Our first project was about the Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, last year's student in Temple, aged 21 and originating in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is anxiety about apocalypse in Western culture, which goes back to centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a stir in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he said.
It's mostly the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who gave courses to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that there were courses here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception coming from a superior authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that in the course of the years, many dates of the last judgment have been mentioned, and he states that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or philosopher on the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to light.
Several told us that they were thinking about going to parties "of the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
