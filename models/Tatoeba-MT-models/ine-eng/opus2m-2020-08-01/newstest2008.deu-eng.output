Foods due to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly increasing food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian notary banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced its leadership. According to their estimates, the increase in commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment would favour the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB intends to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is located in the target mill: inflation must be "consulted" in order to rule out the need for action later.
With 3.3 percent, the rate of inflation reached a 12-year record in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for rising inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF rating increased by 88 percent, and the Soya beans course also reached a record booth since 1973.
Also in the case of food oil and milk products there was a significant price increase in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month, the price reached almost US$ 100 per square foot of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent, but it is estimated that 2009 will fall to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts will go from a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts estimate that the ECB will reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Location of Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathians has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while according to Gallup, the consent for the Socialists has reached a never-existing depth of 13 percent.
The difference is clearly due to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are in favour of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP.
The MDF and SZDSZ are surveyed under the parliamentary inception threshold: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of participants has grown by a percentage in both stocks.
Compared to the last bottom point, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before was the share of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "bad spoken" so high (41%), while another 46% consider it "bad".
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population will expect a further deterioration in the situation; only one tenth will be improved.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - assessed the Prime Minister's work as "more bad than right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% suspicions against the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of those who think you could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without government change.
If 35% of the rest of the government and the head of government had spoken of the unrest in last October, this percentage is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) see the solution only in the new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "safely" participate, and another 20% would "probably" vote.
In comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent of the vote would go "safe" to the polls, and another 15% would consider their participation "probably".
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% against the hospital taggled.
In turn, the group of participants in the vote "with security" would be the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees even 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Buddhist Trade Area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article by Napi Kjság
The price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" also increased by 16 percent this year in the Budaørser Handelsdreijck, but higher prices of more than 1,000 HUF were recorded in all Hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets have been "davonggalupped" last December, the price of the food is not percentagely dramatic compared to the high, earlier level of output.
However, it is certainly frightening to the consumer that what they had paid well below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeds the magical 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, whereas prices for Puten breast files, Nuss and Mohn have risen significantly.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg bread for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price shock on the product at less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink including Pfand cost only 257 HUF.
However, this year the "Napi" shopping basket compares Auchan with the most expensive, and Cora is the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart against the prices of Christmas last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent respectively.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping basket of the last year and the most expensive shopping basket of the current year amounted to 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206.00 Forint in the previous year, however, the increase in value added tax at last Christmas prices was noticeable.
This is precisely the case with trade: it appears that the commodity houses could not decide exactly what price ranges they should apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were invisible.
(If the trader plans to run a product at a bad speed, he may fall for substantial gains in the price range that is geared towards traffic intensity.)
The price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket at 1,630.00 forint cost more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas season, a catastrophic price increase was shown, the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: For some basic foods, the Statistical Office has established over a period of 12 months more than 30 percent.
So in about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has increased by almost 10 percent.
Apparently, they are in a stronger position than the suppliers - while they were able to reverse the dramatic price increase on the multiples.
In the gold triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported for good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses are no longer looking at the prices.
It is bought out of all large quantities, durable food goes into pallets across the Ladentic.
On Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes at the Kassa in all three warehouses, as the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multiples complain to the opinion researchers, they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Various sites are saved by disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals that have resulted in inappropriate treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overlap of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not directly accessible to the infection, thus the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Various sites are also saved by disinfectants.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, a MRSA infection was diagnosed recently.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was submitted after a serious accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection here.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly thereafter the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation since then could not be performed because of the bacteria that are still in the patient’s body.
Until 10 December this year, infections caused by multi-resistant buggers were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many multi-resistant infections have been registered in hospitals with safety, but the number should be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry about one third of the people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA infections (such as neck inflammation, mandelitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healthy.
However, if the means are too high or inappropriately applied, they are produced from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, in patients with weak, or persistently poor immune system, but also in older patients, or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events belong to the hospital everyday.
You must not mix the infection with the epidemic, remember Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only no place where it is not sought.
Antibiotic resistance
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and masks when providing them, and we have the antibiotics needed to treat them," says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are being tested for MRSA when they are being hospitalized, an infection cannot be avoided at all times.
Samples to be rare
Most of the MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the current prevailing conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the inhibition of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant Erguer, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should investigate the patients submitted and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not practiced so often.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the State Hospital.
Therefore, most cases only come to daylight when the patient already has a significant MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the European Union side there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease patterns.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always followed by hospitals.
Among the ambulances, or among the patients in basic care, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saving with disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patient to the other most frequently by the care staff.
This is why the washing of hands or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by foot-and-mouth infection or contact, but domestic hospitals do not always have the possibility to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds are hardly intertwined, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less financially well-off hospitals, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that directly favour infection.
Such infections are proven to be much less common there, or the further spread of the predator may be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections in the grip causes the sickness insurance costs enormously, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its inhibition, was established in the government programme.
According to the first sign, the program is successful - as published data are, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant ruminants (including MRSA), as well as prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Deadlink police chief was not drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the chief police officer of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
Attila Morvai, the head of the twenty-second district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholised nor under drug influence, said that after the official opinion was presented on Friday, the Budapest Supreme Court press spokesman Attila Morvai said.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before taxing.
The former police chief moved with his own car in the XXII. District into the Kossuth Lajos Street and moved over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street to an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milder condition - the driver has, even though pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, afternoon.)
After being handed over to the hospital, the pedestrian is injured.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then returned his functions and sought retirement.
The Budapest State Prosecutor's Office has initiated its investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects carried out under the Cohesion Fund's grants. The 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier in the current agreement on the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also intended to cover the financial financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of more than EUR 50 million which will flow mainly from research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the metro line 4 also came into the language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of the underground funding with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
Loans are linked to EURIBOR, the loan is provided by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - Europe as a whole is paying attention to the former rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the even cheaper market in the EU, but is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now undoubtedly the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses at sea.
Among the mountains are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa regions, the most popular are Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historical towns of Sozopol and Nessbar the racers, however, property around Kavarna and Balcik are still more and more asked.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's heart is also attracted to investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the highly affordable area of Russia lists more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers promising offers - trade and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises and thus attract tourists in the two other seasons along with the summer and winter season.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in the big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria also want to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or downloaded houses by 5-15.000 euros, which then renew themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are written in great detail, but also the proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are crucial to the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest in medium to long-term value increases.
Real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Although real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria within the EU, there has been a price increase of 21% annually in the last five years.
The price of the real estate is far higher than the increase in the fees.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on Bali's roadmap, which sets out emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a strong debate between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate specific figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support developing countries financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on the support of developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol's adaptation fund is to be managed by a 16-head Council, which is likely to be read at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the "Piaac es profit".
Hungary has six percent
Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pre-representative role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that by 2020 the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (according to 1990 values), whether or not the "2012 Agreement" will be achieved successfully. The Union would even be willing to use a 30% reduction if other major industrial countries of the world, or developing countries, are also willing to comply with their obligations by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its 15 Member States at the time, had already committed itself to a 8% reduction.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the years 1985-87 - a standard which will be fully met by the country as reflected in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The use is high on Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, the meaning of which is also the IPCC, the international, which has highlighted the United Nations Scientific Climate Change Committee's latest report, with the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which scientists say would have very serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos on the network against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The footage of the Helmen-based miniature cameras is checked at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are put on the Internet.
Political Message Unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the international peace forces (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally published the videos aimed at recruiting soldiers and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the people of the actual objectives of foreign missions.
This kind of propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however, these videos always contain a certain amount of political messages, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
American advertising with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur footage, which will also create censored footage on the network, such as those that show the death of soldiers: in some hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the most about the losses are discussed, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the battle scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos have already been uploaded to the platform, but these "type" have only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans are in a somewhat different way, with the free downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the player can drag more or less live-stream simulation into the soldier's skin.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogats in the Ministries
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is in no way zimperous: Instead of a Christmas party, she is holding a work conference where her employees can let coffee and pogatche go off in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magical Christmas moods with Tombola or attacks in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffets - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the officials.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is being held today in the defence resort, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Festival of Wages" children are given by fallen soldiers, at which "mission celebrations" family members are received by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NFC) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport propose the strands.
The 4.32 Mio Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics will be held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees will be expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFC) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas party at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT) on Wednesday, with concerts and a feast.
The room rental was 1 Mio Forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 charged guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFC is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the play theater ("Vígszinház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information since we have not reached the authorities.
What's the suit?
The ILO building was not only open to NFU guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with an address from the minister, after which there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] one said: There was no ball dress or suit duty.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self-Government are preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes a celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party but to the conference on the occasion of the year.
It is estimated that there are about 180 guests, who - so the press department - are only being treated with coffee and pogats, the festival will be held with 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply appear in the Chamber of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own conference room to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 Forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent attacks.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate in this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the afternoon party was set up.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year's reception on 20 January, this time the Ministry's Christmas celebration.
One asks the hundreds of guests to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information from the resort, the expenses are measured with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be loaded.
The receipts that will be held each year are traditionally starting with a short call from the Minister and sound with a retaining mood.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas party, no information could be provided during the Ministry of the Environment press department.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the festival, which will be held in the art museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite period beginning on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the popular vote on the Health Insurance Act - the unemployment rate begins.
It is calculated with strike conditions, significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are off until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be shared on Friday afternoon by the trade unions and the trade union federation.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will drop their work for an indefinite period, unless no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even possible to think that it is only in the late hours of the evening, or even at midnight, to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strike beginning on Monday will have to be taken into account with significant traffic barriers: the railways are putting down their work for an indefinite time, the majority of public transport is on the morning and more than half of the Volán companies are silent.
At the same time, there will be a lot of roadblocks in a direction.
The call for strike is followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated on the League website.
Some organizations have announced strikes at an indefinite time, others are planning a temporary downturn.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement on sufficient performance between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railway VDSZZZZ, although around the Christmas Day more and more people are on the way.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from start of operation up to 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA Power and Heat Energy Trade Unions are putting down their work for four hours, and the Teaching Trade Union, among other things, has called for 2 or 2-8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors extends to different times, while the EDPS, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, keeps a two-hour warning.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourses.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Demand number three is that the eligible occupational groups will be allowed to access the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ of the League of Trade Unions did not accept the offer offered by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established in August with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "risk warning" report says, among other things, that in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is "enhancing the existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-citizens in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely to aim at the provocation of such a dispute, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure of political leaders: "People of public life have abandoned the discussion of the Roma issue by representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposite."
This is supposed to reinforce the problem, make the sensible dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard had, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary has been significantly damaged abroad, in particular with regard to confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been constantly under way, so since summer 2007, several organisations called "national Self-Defense Association" have been established.
"These groups are in common that they define themselves as a civil organization each, while they openly urge their members to prepare defence tasks (accidental protection, country defence, order protection), with a call for the inadmissibility of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all this is done in accordance with that method, which seeks to serve different political and political concerns of the population as a civic initiative.
The emphasis of the civil character and the union form are therefore not only the circumvention of legal barriers that could occur during the proceedings - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis is to be taken into account, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the formation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was called.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are reported to be comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass expansions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The UNB has taken the case immediately for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the objective of the "national protection" organisation is to be achieved.
In her opinion, in the past 17 years, a regular "cigeuner error" in Bulgaria has been felt, but the state has remained silent and indifferent - says Political Capital.
Further: The initiative would have triggered a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own fence for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital said at the request of the News Office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and risk-modifying trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not anywhere
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of re-disposal of working days has been established around the holiday in the meantime, however, the next year will protect us from such days.
You also understand something else in the EU and in America under "Faerday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working days.
Unemployed days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working days - the last alone so that the Silver celebrations can rest.
All year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The State celebration is the 15th March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd October, the Memorial of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the establishment of the State, on May 1st the work is celebrated, on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our dead.
In addition, there are every two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on one weekend, the practice of "working days shift" has proved itself in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we work very well on Saturdays before, or have to go to school.
Where this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalized, the Minister of Labour has for many years been laid down in his own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and officials of the public service.
Only companies and establishments in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on holidays, are excluded.
Today, the agenda will only be brought together by the holiday at the end of the year: From 24 December, life will remain formal to this country, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester will take the time off, or the vacation for which it is cancelled.
The following year more holidays fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer re-disposals in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "put on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a quiet day.
The second re-disposition is linked to the holiday of October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to finish on Friday, October 24.
The end of the year, however, will remain idle in the sign of the holiday, after all lies down and remains on 24 December, even if Silvester falls on a Wednesday.
Six horrendous little things to make colleagues angry
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that don't even happen to us anymore: they bring "color" to the workplace every day.
The question is whether to get used to these small disadvantages or to get better acquainted with the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings deliberately for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the Marketing Department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
Best of all, you regret it and try to enjoy it again by perhaps calling and standing at the marketing department, you should have forgotten to send the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get stuck in painful speeches, you should consider how you can really prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations deliberately.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to one alone?
There's hardly anything nervous as if you're picking up a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the device was still on the desk - is it gone early today?
Or is the lost lost bullet writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they will be wronged to the right when they find that something has gone away.
So, no envelopes or post-it from the office stick in the bag, because it could hit one of itself: no more when you need it urgently.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a tratsch that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who?
Where and why?
The information (or suspicions) on the privacy of colleagues should not be tied to everyone's nose as far as possible!
And if someone opens up and betrays his inner secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to keep quiet like a tomb instead of just telling the unsub, even if others know about the problems of the colleague as well.
No reason to be sick reported?
If you are calling in the office to report to sick people who are experiencing painful headaches because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to relax, you should be on one level: your own work, irrevocable excuses, projects with fixed deadlines must now be done by your colleagues instead of by themselves.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you know on the morning that you will not be able to do it in the office the next day, or that something could happen between you, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither your colleagues nor the boss will be unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Totals, Specs, Telephone
You have just been deeply involved in your work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gecko of the colleagues?
Would you like to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard from?
You should not bother your colleagues with sums, songs, loud conversations (which are carried over their heads), trampling, constantly nagging or ningling.
All of this can be very disturbing, even though they are not exactly in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not ready, if you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
As far as possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best you can do is admit your mistakes, and apologize if others were affected too!
The question of how to make the mistake right again, or how to recover the mistake, is just too much!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training shoes and sleepers: Comfortable for home, but nothing lost in the office!
Not even then should you dress as badly as you would if it were actually allowed to work!
Not only do you become too sloppy - you should respect your colleagues as well as yourself to the extent that you dress properly in the office - if desired, also beautiful and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how to become uninterested for others
Stop and go traffic, the car is in the middle of the morning.
From the radio comes a rare melody: the sound of a twin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which corresponds to Mr.2.
The local music scene has not just baffled us with a qualitative electroptic for a long time.
But now you can even see the stack differently when you hear the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the home digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar re-in is "in", the home electrop proves: There is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, performed himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a house does not have two peppers - began to spread his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of Jazz, Electronic, and Pop mellowed, he managed only when he was asked to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"season" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which started in smaller clubs, was only known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" selected its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, shorted almost the only marketable trend set in the West.
There was no doubt that Zagar and his band "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album now published with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying activism would also be fine, but in addition to the essential character of the music, the louder guitars, the influences of the rock'n'roll, - corresponding to the spirit and the trends.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in the Millennium.
A song from the album even created it as a radio drummer - from the latest of early to late pop music, Mr.2 Pet Gossipfi has successively placed the earworm with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "schichtmusic" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be cool and unsaid, but they can also only be produced for sale which makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The willingness of the listener to take part also works according to this principle, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of your music to the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs.: In the rest of the world, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only teenagers or twins go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that pass around them much more attention because they also regard them as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many of your music do you hear?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we've never composed for the market.
With us the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is mostly tangible in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that is, again, only in the irrepressible changes of the moment.
Yet I have one thing: If you want to make it right, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's on his way as a soloist and he's built up his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We are not really going his way, even if you are always trying to include this in our music.
We see ourselves as a teamplayer who trusts in the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took another route.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" in the charts of Mr.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style deliberately staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which was to be held as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and some more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is she exactly what the guiding principle was?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to build the choir from the soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-headed choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik-Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized "underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song as well, or did you design it for the girls?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought this number was "something else".
The Accordion has formally demanded a vote.
I got the melody on the same night, and later they taught the girls.
Everything was practically on the rise and scary spontaneous.
I can remember, I was pretty electric at the time, but it already needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never be so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, you had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo party (except the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing perfectly together and are not louder than music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
And they stood on the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Z.: The fact that they were behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately didn't want to let them come into solo roles.
The number is also about the fact that you should forget your ego a little, forget who came from and where you are on the way, let us simply let these certain birds encourage the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most expensive song?
B. Zs.: In fact, nothing has been done in the musical work of creation, but it has been more difficult to mix.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything has come together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts on and off, and even now, where I have the album "loslassen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deceiver risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Groundless Deceiver
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking company Société Générale, owner of the domestic commercial banka.
It came for almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and he certainly wasn't incapacitated.
Unlike all large banks, he soon recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He is mentally weak," he was hearing from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as the Kerviels statement, published by the French media, such as the Le Monde daily newspaper, shows, he was a man who, at the end of last year, had achieved a profit of 1.6 billion euros with his business.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer he managed to earn half a billion euros just in the American crisis.
He had already said that at the beginning of the year.
In February, the first news was that so-called sub-premium mortgages, such as those that were poor in income, or those that had previously had problems with payment, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel adds, saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the entire interview, he admits that he has faked documents so that he can't get on the rails.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Euroex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Very few.
"I thought she just satisfied the fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Even at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigation officials.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros at the London bombings on the course of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses apparently knew of everything, or they didn't.
"If I make money, you close your eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the great blow.
He lost a billion euros on a single day.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
Suspectedly, he took a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be seen in the cards," Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech Minister and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, which allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately SEK 365 billion).
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive in the years 2007 to 2013 from Brussels.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the resources that Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to earn funds for innovative enterprises.
This means that companies will earn funding for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new accession countries to date in the current acquisition of money from EU funds.
Nicaraguan Court of Justice certifies 20 years of imprisonment for Presidents
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (almost $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is coming back behind the grid is now unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to allow Germany to stay at home or whether to go to prison.
A court four years ago stated that Germany had regularly moved money from the government to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund set up by Germany to finance its election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The government budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget this government has designed and adopted without the support of the opposition by the majority of the coalitions.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) was approved for the current year because it had been submitted by Minister Sobotka (of this party), and the ČSSD could therefore not afford to refuse it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a resolution against the Government, nothing has been dramatic at this time.
The House of Deputies approved this traditionally little observed, yet very important law in all peace.
That's kind of a paradox.
All governments begin and end with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than nude numbers.
In the past social democratic governments, public budgets have been left with three weaknesses that cannot be eliminated at once for 2008:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are compulsory by law, which is not only about pensions, but also about social expenditure, which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction consists of the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and in some ways under control.
However, a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors have provided other sources of investment, with the exception of income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often excessive debt write-offs, which resulted in excessive debt to their councillors.
In recent years they managed to pay off these debts by massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received in the process of privatization by the State.
Now this source is already defeated.
To the extent that we only hold to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, where the ČSSD is famed without delay.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to manage public finances.
Instead, these governments owe the State even more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our Republic.
This is a huge scandal to be attributed mainly to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are at least at risk of poverty in the global context.
This is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been superfluous in recent years.
Even if it is possible to eliminate some of the foolish populist expenditures adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a shift in the age of retirement and a pension reform, then practically any policy in this country will end, and, just as much as anyone is in power, nothing will remain to him as a pure administrator.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that it will then become officials from ruling politicians who distribute most of the tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only provide support for the suppression of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner for 2008 would be very excessive if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was all.
If we do not want it to really happen to become purely administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take taxes and fees, want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Cope With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In this way, more than 100 billion dollars will be made available through auctions to the currency markets.
In these auctions, banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another $24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, following the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of the individual states agree on a coordinated procedure to defend or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can afford," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group in a report for its customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unserved loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what could still happen when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, credit will become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and bring the American economy into recession, possibly with effects on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR to the London Interbank rate used in the loan between banks after they were unable to do so.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by the central banks contributes to the recovery of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Debates of the Ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is likely to damage most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now refers to the UN's international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he explained that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
Klaus said that not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a rare mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-fire which is only a substitute for a real solution to present problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in his presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was thus committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet the cartoons of my views."
So now interested people could clearly review their attitude.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, capable of understanding and evaluating professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main point of the book, he referred to the fact that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists on earth that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are excessive, effective and unacceptable.
In addition, as someone with experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he considers it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and income."
Klaus had talked about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people couldn't exchange their driving licence
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day in which exchange can be applied for so that the authorities can put forward a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the streets without valid driving permits after New Year's.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the trade in lead, the officials of the capital are being overrun with applications, and interest in exchange has grown this week.
The city administration produces about 2000 customers every day.
You've got to go about half an hour.
In Prague about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition will take 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who do not make the required exchange until the end of the year and run without a valid driver's license are threatened with a fine from January.
The villain pays no more than 2000 kroner.
But the police can also use it with a reminder when they commit an offence.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may increase to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the person from the municipality may also receive a penalty which is not at all carried out.
He could, as it was called, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on officials to force Milde and to impose a fine of up to 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand kroner punishment.
The driver's license is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not he wants to own it.
It's not about a personal statement that everyone, even a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their driver's license.
It is enough to bring him to the local authority responsible or to send him there by writing.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers also need to exchange additional types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have time for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court of Justice fines for detectives connected with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, who are accused of having done a joint thing with the band of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
In a powerful judgment, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce its penalty by two years.
Initially, the detectives of the "Office for Combating Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
Against today's judgment there is no appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is accused in this case, but first of all he stands before the judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already received penalties for a total of 16 years.
He can't be convicted anymore.
In January 19 persons were found guilty of theft, and today the Supreme Court negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants fought the charge with the justification from the outset, it is a built case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in agreement with Berdych Criminals Information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to withdraw from the prosecution.
The band left 30 percent of the bags left for Opava and Konyarák.
In the case of the prosecution, the gang's crimes ranged from 1999 to 2001.
Especially in cases of theft, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also in cases of official possession and unauthorized possession of weapons.
In the case of domestic investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
The gang has, according to its thefts, enriched itself with millions of crowns.
With the exception of almost 20 men in this procedure, Berdych and a number of others were found legally guilty of further theft.
Other men from Berdych's district must be responsible in another process, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šuljej, who are in Irish custody, have so far been awaiting the final decision on their release for criminal prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a decommissioning clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask for compensation from the hospital in Trebíč 12 million crowns plus legal costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers every two million, and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
Therefore, the legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, disagrees completely with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal because it is too high," Dostal said after today's negotiations.
"But in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the opinion that created the opposite.
We'll find out if it's worth any statement.
But we believe that this should be for all in the hundreds of thousands," Dostal stressed.
The amount should be between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not taken up her biological daughter.
For Veleba, an opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol served as the basis for compensation negotiations.
The parents of the children suffer psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychology.
The men were better aware of the stress situation, even if they saw themselves being challenged, they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
In turn, the women get worse off with the effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is just going on, Veleba stuck to the contents.
Veronika and Nikola replaced hospital nurses in Trěbíč last December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermáks in Pribyslavice, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Märischen) handed over every family of 100,000 crowns as a replacement for expenses incurred by the failure of the hospital in Trěbíč, which is the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by laws because of liability.
In the event of doubt, they must reach a reserve fund, but only exceptionally can they apply for help from the carrier.
The Courts have so far agreed on relatively small amounts of damages, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polivka came to his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the battle around the brand "Kingrich Walachei".
According to the District Court judge in Ostrava, he used the name "Walachisch King" as the first one, but the project had established a team of Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in long-term work.
Polivka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, this is probably not the end of the matter, and his mandate will probably be called.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to share parasiticly in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas," said Polívkas Prosecutor after the negotiation.
All presented themselves with the words "Walachisches Kingdom" just these actors and comics.
The same is true of Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money procurement and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years they found that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to earn parasitic on our work," he continued.
Lukatory business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachier King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
However, this did not go along with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of giving up walagic passports.
From an original fun action, a business and entrepreneurship began to be crystallized, with Harabiš joining the establishment of the company "Walachisches Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and his signature in the passports and even offered his owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" broadcast for his entrepreneurship purposes.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walloon Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team had been actively dedicated to him.
The cooperation of the parties currently in dispute lasted until 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka in Vsetin organised the official crown.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have begun to rise, which culminated in the section "King Boleslavs I. chosen until the St. Nimmerleins Day".
The leadership role then took on the initiative of Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková as queen's mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the Court rejects today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš to the throne and a half princess.
A new king should come out of this.
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment.
"We don't want to confuse anything.
It should be something like the King's suit in the Walachei.
The King should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages Swim
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not very valuable, the quality of switching, steering and also processing could be described as rather less average.
But now he's his successor, Peugeot 207, on the market, and he's for a lot better.
The combo with the name SW is still a piece, and I just want to review my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of freedom of mind on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available because the combi body is designed so that no two-meter men will suffer.
Move forward
I'm just going through the internal equipment for a little while so I can't repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, where I am opposed only because of the care centre tunnel.
There I would welcome some more design design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over where we may complain about too short seats or headphones.
The content of the page has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
With regard to the range offer, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork here.
In the van the already mentioned deficiency of head freedom is also eliminated.
Bags in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the truck.
I have to call it (also due to the foldable back window) very well chargeable and space-saving.
The cave rooms are equipped with hold belts that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let themselves be drawn together, and also hold on to more difficult objects.
But let's talk about the volume of charge.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains at 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a vacation abroad or when inviting a child's car.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the completely flat loading room or the very low loading corner after the roll-over of the rear seat.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-wheeled petrol engine with a hub of 1.6 litres and a performance of 88 kWp.
And frankly, that's what a 1600-cubit engine should look like that that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, he has a low consumption and he goes well.
If I compare him to his opponent at Škoda, which sometimes works as if his rash were covered with a patch, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not quite popular.
But we need to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 kroner is still on.
With our engine it costs 4109900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test wagon once again offers 80000 kroner additionally to book.
However, we had headlight bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper release, electrical window lifts behind and...
Thus, the car costs only 531900 kroner.
This is a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision to choose the brand remains.
Integration of Slovak students to British schools is not possible
At British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, resulting in domestic fears about the further development of local school life.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been hampered by a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is illustrated by the case of North Kent, where there is a gradual increase in conflict between local and Slovak immigrants.
Disputes, jokes and riots among students have been linked to the relationship between the parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with a iron rod.
The defendant argued that the boy had harmed her with racist insults.
After an attack by two minor girls, the police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks against the man and threw him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bus house and jumped on us.
When I told him he was going to stop, he ordered us to have apples and beers and then blew up his seat," a mother of Slovak students in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases prove that the mood between natives and immigrants in British schools is increasingly tense.
In the United Kingdom, 70,000 Slovaks were reported who came here for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students then visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect of your holiday will be fulfilled if you choose only the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with cellars offering on the beach pizza, ice and disturbing cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it to an extreme extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Ants.
At the time of the Spaniards Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place any human eye has seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel was created at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the leaders of the U.S. Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (especially during the ban) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew, over the broad Boulevards drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty go around Havana to this day because the once-imported schigulis and fiats in the salty and wet air have long been intertwined.
If Havana, especially his oldest part, had come down heavily, there is nowhere around as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are just wasted, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for tourism, there was green light for this development.
Not only have new hotels been created in Havana for the last 15 years, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the Holguín province and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and attracts above all railway lovers.
The sugar tube of remote plants brought steam and self-propelled narrow-tracks to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how you can see powerful and fully functioning locomotives whose old friends are standing in the museum for a long time.
Exploration objectives
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors to Cuba.
This way, you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
Just keep in mind that there is a museum in Hemingways already mentioned that should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Vignales valley in the western part of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The over-vegetation grows on limestone.
The mogots, limestone, and rocks, rise up steeply from the valley floor, gather in their cave rooms fertile soils, which are also covered by wet rock areas of dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.
In its final form you can meet him if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean consequence of the "Major Zeman" television series was turned over there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish had colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth brought her trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth was in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so far away that there was no road to connect the area to the rest of the country in the fifties of the last century.
This isolation contributed to the loss of attention.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was destroyed, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of Sugar Plants".
In the evening, you should go to Casa de la Música, which lives after darkness, and where the music doesn't slow down until morning.
Baracoa
These cities all the way to the east of Cuba refer to some as the most beautiful island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both streets leading there by Guantanamo must cross high and steep mountains and pass through a landscape that is barely affected by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba took UNESCO into its World Heritage List thanks to its unaffected nature.
The best chocolate is produced there, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it was created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present El Castillo hotel, stands, are several tabletops, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the Rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain, the pighouse and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patronate Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves are recognized, many pages could be written about.
But as you say: Better look with your own eyes.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, alleged Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not follow its ideas; in Edinburgh, representatives of the countries stationed in the south of the country agreed to this.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban side, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by its Defence Minister Robert Gates, called on NATO units to become more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start a further development of the economy and security themselves," says British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activities of the Afghan rebels have reached the highest level, according to the US Army, for five years.
The number of acts of violence has risen by 27 percent compared to the previous year, even by sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have crossed an absolute border with regard to the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they call for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made a similar statement.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency for the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's Passive
Among the participating countries, there is also a dispute over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are giving their best.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its liabilities.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
This week the British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" referred to the German soldiers as faulpelze.
"Afghanian non-student: The Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in an article that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper went against the attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to one billion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a public debt of 84,000 kroner.
The total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of public budgetary policies.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its statements on the public debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we will be overrun by a billion crowns perhaps only in 2009.
The following year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said David Marek, an analyst of the Patria Finance, to the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, an analyst of the Next Finance: "To exceed a Billion we could come in the course of 2009.
When that is the case, it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage changes and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take up to 2010.
But I do not depart from such a change," he remarked.
The debt has grown
The debt of the State is attributable to the debt of the State Government and is mainly due to the rise in deficits of the State budget.
The State debt is financed by estimates, government debt statements, direct loans or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
This year's domestic debt rose to SEK 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
At the end of September, the so-called marketable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average rate of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly to be recorded in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts are rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," said Pikora, commenting on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise SEK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the proposed 91.3 billion.
This is also the maximum planned funding for the Consolidation Agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state debt claims for EUR 43 billion and the European Investment Bank's loan rates of EUR 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy Bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher charged in Sudan with insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days' imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She should've deserved to be pissed off.
After several complaints from the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who worked at the United High School of Khartoum was arrested at home on Sunday and, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, was accused of insulting Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its place in early September when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports schoolmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class agrees, 20 out of 23 children Mohammed choose as the favorite nicknames.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not bear a shield with that name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues from Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to get close to a religious belief, I regret only that she had prayed to the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it was only an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many of the teachers who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
It is recalled that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common name in Britain, for which there are 14 different writing methods in English.
This often selected name by Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached at the last negotiating session in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday, without being able to overcome their disputes about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger explained at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that the peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called on to fulfil their commitments to achieve peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
There are no acts of violence expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of tendering on 10 December
The troika mediators, which unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province inhabited by Albanian speakers to 90% could be clarified if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August of the UN had received the mandate for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council's mandate, are in addition to continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, a unanimous solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries maintain their independence under EU supervision for the only solution in the future.
Pristina stands ready to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide on their behalf.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the hotel in Baden, where these last chance negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province, shared his regrets.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations .
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence from the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so much weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken only and alone in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a veto right.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status and added that every unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will be conducted in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference held in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush explained, recalling their commitments to the peace plan agreed by the two parties in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the end of Abbas should seek a peace treaty that should clarify all open questions without exception, including the central issues.
This term includes the three serious problems that are facing mainly the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were evicted during the 1948 conflict from their homeland in the present state of Israel.
After the U.S. President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he committed himself to the fact that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would strive to be able to complete them by the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli that exist alongside each other, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it received assurance from Bush in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a route in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Arabic daily newspaper funded by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are facing.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Police Discipline Authority (IGPN), a police car went on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strips, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without lightning, a spokesperson of the police explained.
A green bike of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, not released for public road transport (see below), came, operated by two young people without helmet, with very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had missed its lead from the right, a policeman continued.
The alcohol checks carried out on the vehicle passengers are very negative.
The condition of the wagon (enhanced coat wings, split wind protection disc, cut-off brake) is evidenced by the stiffness of the impactor.
Very quickly, already yesterday, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an opinion on the " Facts of the Involuntary Murder and the Lack of Assistance to Persons at Risk", in agreement with the Chief Directorate for Public Security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor explained that she excluded the responsibility of police officers from investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the policemen, namely that this small power wheel had arrived relatively quickly on their left-hand side.
Yesterday showed some kind of rails, probably caused by the cracking of the pedestrians on the ground, that the two vehicles were stuck together until the police managed to brake it.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical review.
The body names of the two victims were obdurated yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, so that the police would have left the accident very quickly, and that without the help of the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations that are needed for further investigations and where there is a need for very careful action.
Libération has taken a look at these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, these Witnesses tell us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed cop who went away.
Two others tried to relive one of the young people who called the fourth.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, as it appears, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen of colleagues who had encountered the accident were taken into the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but missing.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police would not have helped young people.
You've been the first to help these young people.
The firearm has arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations, two days before General Musharraf was called out of emergency.
According to the testimony, in Lahore, east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated themselves against the emergency measures were injured by the tear gas grenades used there by the police.
Then they threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, prosecutors of the Supreme Court's prosecutors called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opposition, human rights prosecutors and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had taken place in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northeastern).
On Monday, the prosecutor's movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency and to those who had made an oath before the Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the command over the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the emergency call, said Tariq Azeem Deputy Minister of Information on Monday.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term of office as President ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government deplores the hard - pressed rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy military leader.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed the prevention of reception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a 5-6% reduction rate.
According to the Institute, which states that the percentage of pill users aged between 20 and 40 years using the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of reception prevention has nevertheless allowed for better control of fertility.
In any event, eight of ten births are carefully planned today.
At one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the time of year in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his friends from the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A careful exit, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had left the module Harmony from space transport Discovery, a large cylindrical part, which was soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy module for power generation over solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew was involved in the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, who are able to develop like chordone, was damaged by a glued cable at a length of about one metre
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector anymore.
The astronauts who originally left the spacecraft Discovery for a checkout and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre remote controlled arm of the spacecraft at which the station was installed to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was therefore selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully observing the damage, he broke the faulty cable and secured a type of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the castle, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, the commander of the occupation.
The tool he used to turn a mini-hockey blower into an insulator to prevent several hundred volts from hitting an electric blow, the astronauts on board the station had thought and built.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unpacked before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to space transport Discovery today, likely to join the return journey to Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS on the stock exchange is punished
After the Air and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion in order to counteract the A400M remnants, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 Euro at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again, taking into account the remnants caused by the only slow development of the engine of the A400M which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft amounted to between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion , of which more than one billion for airbus , were announced by the European manufacturer’s parent company EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBITs) for 2007, when presenting its quarterly results, without further details.
The group also states that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month standstill.
To remind us that EADS’ business performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selected status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the Urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very well-defeated election, it confirms its quest for stability, yes even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the voters who had already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President left nothing to be overlooked when he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was pleased to provide a new attack on the Western powers accused of mixing - his favorite theme during the election.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for fair elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have been there.
She's pushing for a campaign of repression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations on the last weekend, Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, according to his lawyer he continued to ban visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two very important questions are raised:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23rd time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot succeed for a third term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Will the President of the majority of Parliament and the mighty party of Russia be elected by the Government and the President?
Whatever the case may be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
It's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their fate, according to sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov from St. Petersburg State University goes back even further: the bourgeois society in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries after Europe, has only developed very slowly; the famous Community spirit has slowed down the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin re-linked to the model of a patriarchal state, which was fully adopted by the population, the more so, since this new paternism was not a terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation says.
Today, the Russians from free pieces refuse the personal responsibility they have given up shortly after the fall of the USSR.
How long will they think about it?
This phenomenon concerns all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative unit understands the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) are holding the local electoral lists of the United States of Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Concluding Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: What is it worth?
Those who are in authority are not so bad that they can ransom themselves.
A Hard to Remember
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the Schicksales of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located 27 km long in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, except for humanitarian purposes, that is, individual and name-related, that is, at the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, with their administration, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Helicopter information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the detentions of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Mastern, the head of this archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have also made these name-related documents available to the public, due to the hectic nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who were deported or subjected to forced labor, and perhaps to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 people are working on tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
However, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
Nothing can be expected in these documents, said Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Today, trade between India and Europe is already reaching the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the South Asian Union.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission figures India is only the new trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will put the two economic spaces forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europeans with a well-being," confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants exchange goods annually worth EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week Danjeale Smadja, president of the European Commission’s New Delhi survey, explained and regretted that trade has not yet exhausted its potential. On Friday, the EU and India meet with their eight diplomatic ministers in New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current recurring concern over credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly tough at the end of the year and to provide the banks with greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to provide an important part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks.
The Bank further states that on 6 December, around 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed in circulation, at the base tax rate and only until 10 January.
This appears to be the first time that the BoE carries on liquidity in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of the interbank loans from day to day with their basic interest rate.
The interbank rate between day and day was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has risen to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums released by the Bank of England have been linked to criminal charges that the banks had refused to accept.
According to certain rumors, strengthened by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many proposed to sign more favourable interest rates for the amounts implemented by the European Central Bank and with a more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to check the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text adopted by the National Committee on Socialism (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) presented about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, of which 50% was for the employment supplement, for the re-introduction of the TipP, for a transport check or for the limitation of rent.
After the UMP and NC voted against the review of the article (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered some intense changes between the majority and opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution to the purchasing power.
The President of the MEPs, Mr Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the draft legislation for the correction of the funds, which was examined last week by the Assembly.
A new festival will be born
As a result of numerous announcements about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 shared with Billboard.com.
C3 will host the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festivals.
In 1989 he took the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Ben added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been a co-owner of production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working side by side to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work hard together with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations in the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in police debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has returned to life at the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago, after it has been profiled in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
In 2007, the two events were able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross taxes.
These two festivals take place in a urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, where the unscrupulous are located on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts together in one way or another, at the same time to convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a city in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and to record a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Wineland will offer delicious rock, but the music will be very diverse, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partner of C3, who won the Top Independent Promotion Award for the last Bolboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the Terminator is facing.
These lock tests are part of the tasks of the delegates.
A political "heicle mandate" because of the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who launches "Runaway Productions".
Is it hard to negotiate with the Governor?
"You must be careful because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered to be the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema is the top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although Sundance, which was by Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about to present the films from Quebec to evaluate them and make sure that the producers provide interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year rally? Disagreement with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year at the stock exchange, investors are already shaking their hands in view of the coming end-year rally.
However, experts cannot create secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that it is purely statistical that the month of December at the stock exchange usually involves positive market developments
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics.
While other experts do not welcome such a strong increase in the last few weeks of the year, they note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, which are investing mainly in pension funds due to the lack of safe stock funds, which is strongly affected by the upward trend in value-added assets.
According to these experts, the stock exchange will be more of a lateral trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially since we cannot estimate the extent of the possible decline in the rate of interest of the US notary bank, which is due in particular to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of an increase in inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a good time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, insured by the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional survey carried out each year at this time.
However, the expert points out that this year things could develop differently, especially due to the fact that already in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day to the day of the constitution, which will take place the final year rally.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Inversis Bank, the previous market assessment is based on an almost technical level, which could soon lead to a deviation from the index values that depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values to drive Ibex to new maximums, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney argues that this year the big values are in line.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, since the electricity sector will be expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha assures the Bank of Inverses that the increase in the banking and industrial sector will go down.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACS has been on the course and we hope that other real estate companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will take the same route, says the expert.
With regard to increased consumer behaviour during the Christmas Day, the market will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in small numbers.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two declines have occurred in December.
At the end of 2003, the technology blast took place, leading the stock exchange from its crisis and at the same time initiating the last real year's rally.
This year, in which Ibex raised 35 to 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rate increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will result in the fifth winning year (the Ibex has been rising by 8.36% since January) and can also present an end-year anniversary, it will be shown.
Popularly, its 200 credit institutions will have opened 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in Spain's most economically strong regions.
For the Institute, which operates under the name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first banking group is the leap to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30 a.m. on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly read about the extension of its opening times in the branches, has not yet reached a final decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement, where 75% of all branches are closed on Saturday and open at one afternoon, even if not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, depends on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And that's exactly the intention that the popular pursues with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, because of their situation, can capture the lucrative knowledge of self-employed, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large buyers.
The Bank wants to open up the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of opening times is thus linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Angel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require any greater investment, but with an increased staffing position, as a branch now did not need six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches that will even be equipped with additional space for SMEs will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popularly, his concept has already been tested by nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience values fell out positive, says Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a clever solution.
Popular is currently looking for around 2500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the name Mundocredit. These are specializing in immigrants and also feature extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these popularMax branches, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to be competitive for our customers, says Rivero.
With telefontica, they have reached an agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking personnel.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles his stock exchange value for the first time and thus takes over his rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the stock exchange. The broadcaster led by him had increased his value twice by his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had less losses, he said.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they were not too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an extra of 2.54%.
This gain reduces its previous loss to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%) and Vocento is only 13% involved.
Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value is 2.193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) to 2,518,53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be seen from the fact that it is two similar companies, says Vasile.
Of course, there is also a question of how much we can actually do stock exchanges, at what price and how we can make it at customer level.
Telecinco explained his plans a week ago to raise more than 1000 million gross advertising profits to the first television station this year. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespana, the advertising company of the group.
If the project was to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's better stock exchange rate is the high payout ratio that the company could have at present: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend expansion.
Vasile assures, however, that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of endemol, with mediaset as parent company, could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far said much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: puts on its high effective income and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buy) due to the multiple incentives and the flourishing market a more advantageous position with antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPMorgan: in view of similar threats (satisfied market and poor economic climate), it is recommended to re-establish expectations in both cases
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which today ended with the Senate Congress decision on the draft supplementary/amendment proposals, the Government published the provisions of the new law with a view to enabling both regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of Congress and Senate Members who had pursued the objective of establishing the best possible arrangements to ensure investor safety and regulate individual business activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the IMF, which re-established the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the control demand of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various European Union supervisory authorities.
The new Directive enables both specialised firms and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), consultancy companies that are associated with investment and brokering companies.
Furthermore, it expands the number of financial transactions systems so that the regulated turnover markets are added to the multilateral efficiency trading systems and to the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The Act obliges investment firms to register the main points of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and all the projects carried out to facilitate the control task of the CNMV.
The Congress's Economic Commission saw further changes in the future, in which it decided that the debt write-off now has to be considered as a complex financial asset for the investor due to its high level of risk, as confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of graduates of economics; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the working areas reserved for economics, was adopted.
The Senate, on the other hand, identified new positions in the financial sector, how the economic intermediary working abroad does not need authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the acquisition of several investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (IPI) has risen by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare local and quality data with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up in advance by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) recalled that the indicator that was determined in advance was only indicative and therefore did not have to comply with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase of the IPV in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it ensured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Sundays in the conference halls found that even if the current figure is not good, Spain's inflation difference with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs announced the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
The assets of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half, after the Bank had been in crisis in mid-September last year, the British notary bank had asked for an emergency credit, and they currently amount to only 12,000 pounds ( corresponding to 16.800 million euros).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounting to 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has been significantly reduced by the loss of trust of customers within two and a half months, and despite the 100 percent government guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after its acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to make up about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will be made up of the facilities for the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The Group of the Multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to allow 50,000 million pounds (approx. 70 million euros) to flow annually to advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its favorite bidders to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for allegedly suspected involvement in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to Murcia this morning, due to the urgent suspicion of development in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales, current MP of the Popular Party and then President of the Totana municipality, and could, according to information provided by Cadena SER, be the original wire carrier of the plot.
Officials will continue to examine the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and will not exclude further arrests within the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused, the chief suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and consequently privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested on leaving his client's residence because of important burdensome documents to be linked to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from the alleged orders of Morales are reported to a Galician construction company that provides for the conclusion of a city-building contract in which the construction of a large area of 200 hectares has been decided.
Eight people are currently being investigated.
Bono agrees to accept the candidates of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of an election victory, at the Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. According to him, he will present the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming General Elections in Toledo and, in the case of a election of Socialists, will take over the office of Congress President.
This is how José Blanco, the organisation secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party headquarters.
According to the Chief of Government, the offer to the former Minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would appear to be the president of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who announced last November 15 that he would no longer join the next general election, end his career in public policy and instead take part in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had repeatedly pushed him back into the political situation.
Furthermore, he pointed out that the party, as the Vice-President for Economic Affairs did not want to keep the citizens in mind, who, in the event of an election, would take over the President's posts and that this was an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the House into a house of respect and not to turn the insult or the scream to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, the impression is that the only place you can't talk about in Madrid is the Congress; the President of the Government was interrupted up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he commended the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to awaken the appearance of having already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would consider it arrogant.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to an unhindered criticism of both climate change skeptics and those who are leading a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must bring about strong cohesion.
In particular, it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, makes it a statement on the action, or non-acting of its government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being at the top of the EU, which has at least met the Kyoto Protocol's requirements.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance with the requirements on which this is to be done, and why has his Government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to provide the Spanish citizens with the measures he has envisaged against climate change without any change.
What companies will be affected by the behaviour to be changed by citizens, the individual and collective savings measures to be implemented and the economic consequences of these measures.
More precisely, who needs to sacrifice and will be paid for saving the planet.
However, it has and will not give such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be implemented against climate change are unwelcome.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and dangerous for the companies and citizens' accounts.
Even the petrol-cent proposed by the PSOE appeared selectively dangerous in view of the fact that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Thus, it is now true to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty words without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its treaties with the planet, the other politicians so suitable for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse nor demand, but instead comply with the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and inspire others with its mildness and goodness.
But this can only be done if the contract does not deviate from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not provide that the bicycle will be the only means of transport in the future or that we can only be refreshed by a specialist.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to alleged development into urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were also taken into custody because of the arbitrary suspicion of city-building violations, today it was called a survey.
The city council was held at its residence, from which it was taken to the municipality and in its premises until now, surrounded by numerous agents who were also in the city administration and in the municipal construction of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unresolved construction ground for urban projects under the leadership of the Galicia construction company Nuaria should be redesigned, which should build 4,000 apartments on the property after the local administration has read them illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six prisoners were brought to the judge today.
According to findings, Juan Morales is also identified against the former mayor of Totana and currently independent PP.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current resident friend in Murcia, is under suspicion.
The president and owner of the group Nuaria , the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Immonauar Pablo José M.G., whose company was intended to operate as a group of Nuaria and to receive the butter money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban delinquency, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly linked to the prisons in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rosas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, which should have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area to be rebuilt in Totana. The aim was to implement a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking areas of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building materials.
Things That Can Happen
1.
If you agree to this, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to find a price designation of other names with appropriate skills.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki Sanomat, (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; incidentally, on the day on which the publication included the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the Faculty of Philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturant who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview in the daily newspaper Helsinki Sanomat, President of the Board of Education for the Faculty of Philosophy, Pekka Elo asked teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and proposed that the Platon teaching from the sub-level curriculum for the Faculty of Philosophy in Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the admission of illegal Internet downloads into the criminal law book:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which will be subject to six months' imprisonment.
However, once again, if you steal a music store below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft will be a criminal offence, yet the penalty will fall less than if you download it (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you search for a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
A three to 12 months prison sentence (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data has resulted in a six-month prison sentence of up to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to article 184.2 of the Penal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films whose author's authorisation has not taken place is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, then someone has raised his demands quite nicely.

My home doctor sends me one of his long, rare research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly payroll depend on the level of the colleagues.
The study was developed with the help of a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the science journal.
According to the statement Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Centre Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and fired his partner.
The researchers found that the brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct in their response and were therefore given the same content; but if one of them received double the amount, it was also more brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The public prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been after the Balkan war criminals for eight years. Her office is in the state prosecutor's office of the criminal court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and smiling eye, as the chief leaders of the massacre of Srebrenica - at the age of eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - the former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free on foot.
Their names are listed by the director Marcel Schüpbach, from Switzerland, as a template for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that uses the pace of a police triller to track the Swiss state prosecutor from Belgrade to New York during its project to track the missing criminals and pressure the respective governments to narrow their networks.
What insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance covered by a possible accident caused by the driver includes a high cost burden, which depends on the height of the car and its use, including age, sex, the time of creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of car to be insured, etc.
Having a car is only the beginning.
Because it's even harder to find the right KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it has to be clear what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract which determines that the company receives the corresponding insurance premium and is obliged to submit the corresponding amount in case of injury.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, sex, time of creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in the event of a higher accident.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women have to make less contributions, since statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate because of their caution.
The same applies to married persons, who, according to the statistical values and therefore according to the firm's conviction, tend to be less accident than individuals.
The benefits measured by the vehicle affect the frequency of the drive and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs most.
We are now listing the most important points that should be taken into account in the selection of insurance in order to be able not only to make a performance but also to make a pre-oriented choice.
Under 25 years of age, when choosing affordable insurance, many obstacles, such as low driving practice and young driving licence, are encountered.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance policy to complete a full insurance policy, there are still more expensive alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full-cask with self-interest, so that the services of a full-cash insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europe, a brokering company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures the customer against external accidents, but not against the damage caused by the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a tip.
When you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; your credit card increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A letter of credit is a reduction in the basic salary of the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs.
The amount of credit and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a rich year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
It is therefore best to decide on a full-cash insurance with self-interest.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their past experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been put off.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete full-term insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the insurance side, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contributions are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with self-interest (in the case of an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit card, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of the vehicle.
In total, they are more relaxed and have a larger purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is proposed to complete a full insurance with self-interest (in the case of an amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance which is only used with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidents, but also because it brings high costs that require a thorough selection that meets our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan at the point for the Eighth Final
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the missing point on the coming Tuesday in San Siro to reach their respective goals even before the finalisation of the Champions League. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while deciding on their participation in the shots.
The Italian team has already got five points and have already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an undecided in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine more points is needed to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not include Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to join the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time at the 13th half final for the entry to the 16th final.
Thus this group will be completed in front of all others and the decisionless in the Guisepe Meazza Stadium on the expected outcome, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not be willing to speculate at home, the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory, they would have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even have a defeat enough to qualify in a sleep of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are at the same level; they had lost in Glasgow (2-1) last week, but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the mailers will try to miss the shot in the evening. They hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned champion league for the second time, after they were defeated in the pre-season of the same round by a Kaka door in the back-up time (1-0) and by a zero to zero undecided on the back-up.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, since both the achievement of the eighth final and its membership with the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lowest position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the greatest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place by winning and thus join UEFA.
20,000 people in Vancouver attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour.
In the Canadian Vancouver, Spice Girls gave 20,000 viewers of the launch show for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) just before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium, said that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
About 20,000 people were able to live the concert at the sold stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which had taken care of furore at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headslines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on the stage that had previously been donated to them by the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who brought the GM Palace to shine, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned it from him in the previous days.
While preparing for the show Victoria Beckham told us that the British star has not received our wardrobe once, and that is why I am already very excited about what he will be holding from the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal differences of opinion two years later the resolution of the group moved, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I didn't really think about it; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm spoke about the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been eliminated and that they all liked each other again.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
At first, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special machine of Virgin Airlines, according to a report by the TV channel CTV.
On their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will take place as the next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute rages between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The vast majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and each dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the gas, it will account for higher transit charges from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries has reduced deliveries to the EU last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state Gas Monopol Gazprom try to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for gasprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in talks," said Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters News Agency.
"The changing global gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [after Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which led to a dramatic rise in prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas emissions worldwide, but many of them remain underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service needs to improve the checks of the pre-trial register for workers from outside Europe, one member of the supervisory body said.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service did not have precise ideas about the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in case of a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated staff recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving a field car through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transmission, and was charged with the accidental attack of a car bomb in Britain.
Public health services are expected to carry out checks in the event of the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they possess the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Health Authorities use Discovery Scotland to review pre-trial records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now says, in addition to other recommendations, that the board should follow the guidelines of the criminal record extract, that employers should help with controls in different countries.
"Although we have found information on these controls in some staff documents, these have not been carried out on a regular basis," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research directives before they were hired, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland-Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the field of the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could be involved in future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-employment tests by the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will be delivered," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was probably higher, also because the board had problems identifying those employees who were allowed to work indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely respected.
These include passports, work permits and qualifications checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a matter for me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations in the event of recruitment of all employees - including those from abroad - would be reflected in their plans for publication next month.
Joy Division Dominant Film Award Award
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division Singer Ian Curtis has hosted five awards at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Prices were also awarded to Chief Agent Sam Riley, who worked in a camphouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, Director Anton Corbijn, and Deputy Director Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was the best lead producer for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond-Darseller Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for getting the British film into the world public.
The prizes were given at a ceremony in London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - was turned for only 3 million pounds.
Nevertheless, he introduced two awards to the Dutch photographer Corbijin, who is the best director and the best director for the cult cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree.
Rockmusic was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - as Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best performers went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winston, who is called to play hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize he was named after the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Sea Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathies of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003 as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, identified by a foreign citizen, is attacking an oil plant in the eastern province, following the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed 35,000 men to protect the largest oil processing plant in Abqaq in 2006 after a failed Al Quaida attack.
The report, referring to a domestic declaration, says that 18 of the detainees were part of a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the Kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees reportedly had to kill spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned more to do to stop Saudis who are trying to join with Al Qaida militias, who want to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the U.S.-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is viewed by the hardliners under the Sunni Saudis as heretics.
Al Qaida militias viewed many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as being in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader Al Qaida who was born in Saudi Arabia to target the provincial Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector installations.
"This has been a very great effort of the security forces over the past five months," a spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also included a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to advertise for the "Takfiri Think" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which are being marketed as unbelievers and firemen.
Among those arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on a orbit show that the planet is even more like a distant twinkle of the earth than it has ever been.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planets, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have ruled under conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabited by scientists today.
But due to the uninterrupted carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus started a completely different developmental course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by Hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which has investigated the plants for a year, offer a refreshing view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are quite similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which the Venus has begun billions of years ago like the Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by the police
A kilo radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
In the middle of Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally declared himself ready to put a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters raise and submit questions on video to send them to the candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflect exactly the state of the Republican Party, which will be in the elections next year.
It is unknown, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with those who selected YouTube clips to show the candidates concerned.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the centre.
The issue is one of the most striking issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things that felt to them: the TV station noticed the tops of the consent when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of evenings was between Rudy Giuliani, the national predecessor, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to discredit the call because he had been persistent about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly keen as interrogators to ask whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More significant candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressor, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressor from Colorado, were able to address this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances in the nomination, but they both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been stuck earlier and harder than others to immigration.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates share in large and all the same views: stricter borders, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic than other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered torture.
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not believe in the history of Jonah and the Waldenses.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now opposite all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to support her, Jesus laughed at her and said that Jesus was too smart to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa is accompanied by Ron Paul's latest donations and his crash in the debate on Wednesday.
These two are shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkle to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sloppy.
No noble title seems to be sold, no politicians paid Paris hotel bills, no external toes were lost.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than $650,000 (1.3 million) for the British ruling Labour Party over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good for Gordon Brown without the fighting.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn the request for election, in this way policing the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed to Mr Bean.
The unsent rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment on bail.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have led to associations of companies against the government.
The fiscal loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A Trio of Generals in Rest began a rebellion in the upper house in protest against cuts in military expenditures: to be the minister of the military, they claimed to be part-time jobs.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary General (and her former CEO) has already retired.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably giving way to retirement.
However, governments can achieve a turning point after which they cannot feel it.
They don't like politicians or trusted people, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force seizes the office.
If it is clear once that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and it does not need to be long enough to do so, this delay is over: the public service is starting to go unnoticed; the cabinet ministers are starting to complain; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because he can't claim to be a new bear, unlike other political leaders.
If he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax authority documents, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misbehavior - as in the long "Money for Adelsittel" investigation of political party funding - the voters may assume that he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks.
The faults are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely crushed.
And the antidote, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new witness for political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske Abraham, who compares his gifts with his evil gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but the decision on this was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he would have known of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will naturally have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief finance manager, who was told about the separate donations in October.
However, Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his taking office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he softened this determination by arresting a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop in a state of rest and a judge.
In this case, the "teaching" is not very complicated.
Once the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from this, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, like finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour Party to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a partner such as Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unquestionable justice and solid competence.
Cardboard
Does the credit crisis set the American credit card market on?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that the back fluids stir up.
Now that America's real estate market is corrupt, the predators have the country's credit card market in the viewer.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
The signs of the voltage are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the cancellations and the interest rates that measure the share of the loans that are not deductible or too late for more than 30 days.
In the last month, HSBC announced that it had received a $1.4 billion levy from its US consumer finance, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
However, it is too early to fall into panic.
Loss and loss are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage below the historical average.
In part, the deterioration in the Councils can be explained by technical factors.
An amendment to the US Private Solvency Law in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of tendering which, in turn, accounted for a large part of the loss of a chain card; the number of applications (and thus payoffs) would increase again if the general conditions for creditors were to deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports on sound payment rates that show how much of its debts consumers pay each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, estimates that spending will eventually be 25% higher for 2007 than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certain: it is more likely that consumers will incur credit card debts, now that home loans are liquidated.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling home prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the credit value of the creditor.
You can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are lower if the properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts become more important under the repayment priorities.
Map exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than creditors to the stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones Chief Financial Rapporteur.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable divestment are much more real.
If lower domestic prices and a credit reduction in America are forced into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a worse future.
Keep them looking at these shark streams.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be brought before the court for their role in the fraud system with the former Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search into debt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially had seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for allegedly conspiring with fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was put in place on January.
But during a hearing before the U.S. District Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone was guilty of fraud by means of telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during delivery procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, its case is a loose end of an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastov aware that it was the aim of an investigation of the government in relation to the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed that they had come to Houston in 2000 to expel a fraudulent plot with fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machines, who contributed to the company's success in the competition.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Copper control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for participating in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely argued against Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, fastows and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while fastow, copper and other $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, fastov was known in two counts of conviction for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year sentence and a month in an establishment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States pending the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, broke up in the competition in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover the billions of debts or allow weak businesses to appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Schilling is a punishment for more than 24 years.
Lays' convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were nullified after he died of heart disease last year.
Not all of them down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the G550 Golfstream brand, equipped with a roll-Royce engine and enough range to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is small for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it's for a private family or company president."
Firer was on the golf course last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day organ of consumption that was held in a closed exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury showrooms had been built, hoping to interest newly arrived Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-täcken yachts to diamond-overs that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Four carefully took a brilliant orange Porsche at the next exhibition stand into the viewer.
"That's a nice car, but it's small compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be overcrowded with money like Dallas at its finest times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to giant wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overairmen of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the world's most visible money-free issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold.
In Moscow this week, another conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, has been invited to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars, totaling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires in the second grade, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the minimum of existence in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - so we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
For the first time she had visited the fair with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-maintained and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they walk through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a rotary carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily aimed at the new ones, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in the barn for several hours to visit an accessible warehouse, which was pleasantly Cadillac Escalades, platinum bag bag, Mövenpick Ice cream, customized billiard table, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bays.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a show stand by the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft in front of a large imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaics.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of naked brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, went through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the general manager of King Koil Bedten, said here, had sold two $70,000 matrix sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with one gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that a company equipped the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the green orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, said that a company that adapts luxury cars to customers' wishes, would have sold three car coolers for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are equal to linked chain arms, for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with stores that he had worn with colourful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-off.
"The Russian millionaire, the street leather biker or a picture of his wife's face from the Cuban circus will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30s or 40s garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the increase in the real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich at a stand run by the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to a British example, which were completely shut down with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees would have printed 500,000 false bank notes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around the money boxes, to borrow mobile phone photos, while they were in the middle of the spare capacity, to let friends cut, or simply to insert a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Suspected operation at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest party as Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and observed a car at the white Cape Cod next two doors at the West Scott Avenue.
Soon after that, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the boxing car of the medical bodyguard arrive," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Office.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked at the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and they are hopeful that toxological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to reveal a mysterious death sent by a mourner by the Newark Police headquarters.
Since September 2006, Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice has been widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She was protecting me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the alcohol control committee, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the Union County State Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That's one of the ways," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house about 3 p.m. in the afternoon of November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where there's a dazzling rosemary in the very front yard, and a Dalmatian knocks behind the house.
A blue facade with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes depend on hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after he had spent 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that one," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise of world stock markets
The shares went on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market openings that the Central Bank was trying to calm down the credit markets by further interest increases, with overwhelming comments from the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 by Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that the policy had to "flexibly and pragmatically" react to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down pitiful markets, in view of the signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the latest turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence remained, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step up and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rates.
The executions also helped calm the Wall Street, despite other bad news from the US economy, now that the sale of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were stressed by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure, to offset serious losses from their lost assets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55% to close at 13.289.40, while the wider-based S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
In the past, the resumption of credit pressure on the markets was stressed after a strong demand for a three-month guarantee auction by the European Central Bank granted to the European commercial banks was granted a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up on other capital markets in London increased as the credit tensions increased when the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks increased by 6.59 percent to the highest since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to beat as number 6 for England in Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, is here at least under this special title, to help head coach Peter Moore and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morris, the English business director, fills itself with applications for national voters, even if not for which in part-time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth beating position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is certainly it.
It is never easy to find out exactly what makes it possible for a person to reach the top of his career, while someone else never climbs above the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgements are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area if, for example, John Edwards or Tubby bannerjee, both intelligent young executives with good conclusions who know the business well should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or swim.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances have this too.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a hitter must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selector is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, James Anderson, who appears to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explained himself to be healthy and how the wind congested into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgirya stage can only be a question of view.
The choice could determine the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood was still struggling to stick, who created the breakthrough as a major test cricket player, and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and feelings for Shah's greater experience of boparas' youthful enthusiasm after another discussion during today's network session at Asgirya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his functional and valuable 88 test debutings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundred and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at age 22, and an excellent balance against revolving balls.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West India in the test in Lord, his Heimaarena as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan, was healthy in order to regain his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beat, which was still revealed in Bombay.
On the contrary, the all-performer from Essex has a sense of pleasure in life.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket site, and his attitude was brought to the fore when he had recently hit a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his Vodafone (of course also a sponsorship) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from afar, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he congregates his medium pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be there well if, as the tea set suggests from Ceylon, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaida
The first shipments of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of distributors whose funds or visas have run out, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before 800 people from Damascus arrived in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni physician.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the shooting militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to return to the moment.
Qasim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah urged him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States had contributed to disbanding Al-Qaida from its base in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was evicted from his house in Sleich in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had urged his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al Qaida militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the support of my boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obedi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing peace in the capital since the U.S. troops rose and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens", which were armed and, in cooperation with the American military, defended their city districts.
But more were said to be forced to go home due to visa problems and winning money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Syrian Prime Minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are likely to flee from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to give no more visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who knocked down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnits were distributed from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have been left behind.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
In only one area of education, the Saarland countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Saar country yesterday about 50 times that we are not French" - this slogan paints the smallest federal country self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in place in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities are already working closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple lead.
Therefore, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
However, the country children also bring the Saarland in an average number to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
More than every five young people acquire their study rights at a vocational school, so that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also relatively well developed.
As measured by the population, dual study equipment is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of England has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering.
"In general education schools, we have launched a number of reforms after the first Pisa study," says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
This is how the government introduced national comparative tests.
In order to start learning the children earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether the performance of the students improves sustainably will only be shown in future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students declined from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland did not grow as strong as other federal countries.
The Bavarians are better off.
And in addition to the Saar countries, foreign language knowledge will not be measured at Pisa - otherwise one could point out.
Because the language of the neighbours is compulsory to the Gymnasium - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez converts watches
In Venezuela the clocks are soon different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to return the timer in the South American country for half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clocks will be set at the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that exists in no other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, inter alia, that the United States of America should have completed the division in full-time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced the interruption of relations with neighboring Colombia on Wednesday (location time) due to a Geiselfaffer.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not have relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is leading a constitutional reform, about which citizens of the island must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostages.
In his decision, Uribe had "scattered in the face", Chávez criticised Sunday.
Also in Spain, Chávez is in all mouth.
A new phone ringtone provides for furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you hold your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken of by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was generous at the recent Ibero-American summit of the constant interrelationships of the left populist and was driven through the mouth.
German threatens 2007 Pay minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are threatened with real wage loss, according to this year's forecast.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could actually count on less on the cash account than in the previous year.
"The debt is the modest wage development, the value added tax increase and the price fluctuations in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" edition.
New burdens could also arise from unemployment insurance on workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent for the year-on-year change is correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour must not be forced again to ask for loans or grants when the Federation has to do so, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil has been driving inflation rates to the highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices rose by 3.0 per cent per year.
Venus is the Holicle twinning of the Earth
The Venus is thought to be more similar than ever in spite of its life - hostile atmosphere on earth: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines in Poland, as they appear on earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that it bluffs on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has given evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on the Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from Cloude to Cloude, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "supply theory", lightnings have created life on earth: wets should have stimulated reactions in the ocean leading to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should hardly be anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on earth, it dominates with temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the devil's will of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is so much like the earth in mass and size, has so much different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The beginning of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the 1990s there has been no probe alone to investigate this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "natural" articles, are not just the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to researchers.
"They also show that the communions of our neighboring planet with the earth are greater than the first accepted," the essay says.
In addition to the already known vertebral wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud cloud at the South Pole, which is much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the Earth’s Winter Hemisphere, writes a research team about Giuseppe Picconi from the Italian Istituto di Astrophysica Spaciale e Physics Cosmica.
The second-largest planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening stars, circles around the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns a lot slower around itself: a Venus day takes 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under similar conditions.
On both, water was collected, which remained on the earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonaceous stones, it makes up the vast majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Cooler defends trade marks meetings with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler asks for the reception of Dalai Lama in the office.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler has taken care of Germany's view and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute about receiving the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told the trade sheet.
At the same time, Cooler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Kohler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the president stressed, but Merkel took a new China policy in front of the draft.
"The Federal Chancellor has not withdrawn from the traditional one-China policy.
That's what China knows, too," Kohler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly identified the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by a number of Unions.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's 'extreme policy' in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
In this way, the Chinese leadership not only launched the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to SPIEGEL.
China's government chief Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China refuses when European politicians officially receive the religious leaders of Tibet, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The acts and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schwable warns against Krawalas as in France
Street fights with the police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawalen as in France.
Everything had to be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany did not get rid of violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior called for.
Barricades burned, Randalliers shot at the police with shrotflints: After the heavy youth carnivals in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears similar developments.
"We must be careful that social explosives do not build up and relax in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person is entitled to the rapid change in social reality.
The feds, countries and municipalities were already working with emphasis on solving problems, Schäuble said.
This is not only about the integration of migrants.
"From the summit of integration to the Islamic Conference, this is the first success."
However, for warning, it is too early.
Schäuble points out at the same time that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people had suffered severe street fights with the police during the last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Increased integration efforts by the Federal Government called for the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawale in France, Kolat warned against "follow-up effects".
The situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with migration background was "on average" under 25 years.
In particular, more training places have to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany more than in France "social control is taking place in the families".
Furthermore, many young people with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Kolat recalled, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people must be "quickly given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in Paris's Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police forces were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with light bulbs.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning dumpsters and cars.
Since Monday, a offer of approximately 1000 security forces has been providing peace.
The police will go through as long as it is necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the capital.
On Tuesday night, about 80 policemen were injured in Krawalen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the wake of this, the unrest overruns on Toulouse.
The Krawale burned themselves in a traffic accident when two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not liable for the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Cloude
The far-reaching appearance of the Chancellor proves that the coalition is in the end - and that it is no longer expected of itself.
What country does this federal officer actually live in?
After her unrestful appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was harsh and poor, one must say: not here - not in the country that you should finally be ruled by.
The suggestion that they focus too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an angered sentence.
This was provincial, she said and only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Federal Day, it has documented to all that is recognizable the extent to which their proposal has been made.
There was no specific interest or even a feeling of concern for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who flees to foreign policy and stays there in the vicinity.
Example of climate protection: There she praises herself unhesitatingly for the decisions of St. John's, but does not say how to achieve the climate targets.
In any case, the self-lob - so much inefficiency would have been lost to the head of the CDU two years ago.
Now she clings to the floscule that the upheaval reaches the people.
In this way she damages her image as a pragmatician who solves the problems rather than beautiful the world.
But in the realm of Angela Cloude, domestic problems are a border appearance.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low-income?
A couple of side sentences she's got for it.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to child abuse.
Three runs require Merkel to produce a half straight sentence.
It smears like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attacke Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Central Romney are providing a hard fight exchange - and now they must fear an external candidate.
The pressure of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", with Romney presenting his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This counts with heavy assumptions: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegal," rejected Giuliani and proposed to the former governor of Massachusetts to employ private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are bluffing at the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidents are using the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30-second videos that Internet users have posted via YouTube are hardly more than voice speakers.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain suggests to his opponent Ron Paul, who, as the only one in the round, demands an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets heavily read by the Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method that is simulated in drinking as torture.
However, the main topics of the campaign are beyond Iraq's war and torture debates, the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are always awarded and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium will fire by accident.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, blushing and presenting to the base and television audience a request that he was still one of the execution advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to understand when he is asked to explain the Bible literally.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in Civil
One day after his resignation as Chief of Staff, Pakistani President Musharraf has been defended as President.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has been sentenced to another five-year term on Thursday.
The Pakistani television oversaw the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf pledged to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as Chief of Staff to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and was particularly moved by international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after his conquest in an unblooded military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander of the military forces, Musharraf had met a core requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency that the Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf, according to Attorney General of State Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will remove the state of emergency and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which had occupied the Musharraf after the suspension of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had dismissed all objections last week against the contested re-election of the Chief of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more were injured in the northern region of the tribe of North-Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Crowd Return
The German supergroup of the Seventeen musicians again: The three band members of Harmonia took up their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For Revival there is an average of its great time "Live 1974".
At the time, they were much more famous abroad.
The above feeling then takes place in the form of three men set on the evening table.
Each one has his chest before him, his cables, and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius cross in the flower-white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by Laptop and Guitar.
Right, considered by the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, including even a beat.
And sometimes it happens to add to a traditional piece of music.
That does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The band Harmonia again has provided some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here you can reveal: Targeted requests have shown that the name was difficult through collective pop memory, but not so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
At the same time, what is called misleading Krautrock is more and more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music economy gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for Lifeworks, they were seen in the room in question in German pop-faces.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise did not know the limits.
At the concerts Michael Rother later jumped at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the declaration abroad is one.
Therefore, the memory is already overloaded with harmony because the trio existed only two years and at this time also developed a much smaller power than they were later assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubhünne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had recently trained at power station and then played a call as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Roth followed the Cluster musicians into exile to Forest in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th - century ruins, they lived as fugitive municipalities.
Less ideological than in the municipality I, where Roedelius could still be injured as a girl.
It's more like a top-level artist's den.
Apparently, there was also a twist of the concert harmony Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them were holding on to harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Because so left and modest the music also sound, the band has a material need.
The collection did not serve only the self-esteem.
The CD "Live 1974" now appeared was cut off at a concert in Griesem, in front of a almost 50-head record music, as someone thinks to be.
At that time, the desire to force harmony and practice occasionally came from Rother.
For Roedelius and Moebius an unsightly demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in Esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
The cluster has been relived in the eighties and has been more successful since it was harmony.
The gray live album is to thank Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a pure German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical restoration of harmony takes place in the Berlin House of the World's Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Waldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade Erfinder Dr. Motte.
So that the entire bandwidth of the influences of the Krautrock would be passed on to the following pop music.
Harmony fills the gap of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most special sounds in the hall: "The only true music you belong to is the future."
There are images showing producers with harmony in the farm yard.
Legendal education serves projections of other black and white photographs of our curved devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drummer, to untangle unstoppable sounds of the instruments via self-assembled power devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technical deepened Tifler.
It also doesn't change the choir of the house.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morningstarns, it is accommodated under sound clouds and sung at a beautiful place with Emphasse "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music schools (can), technologies (power plant) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and harmony can't get out of it even now.
Even the most self-intellectual is thoroughly thought over on stage.
Where does music start, and when does it stop?
This can rob one of the nerves or protect a volatile moment of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killing Peace", two films are again engaged in the Balkan War.
But they're not convinced.
Either the concepts put too much on action and soccer or they are too moving.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark background of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties last year because of all too many non-essential roles in women's well-being films and all too many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunter" (Why should film titles today always be as long and will be like pilot tariff agreements?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderful eyebrow presentation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what might have been from gere if the fate and the film industry were not as polite: a man who has long been behind his best times, but who has preserved, even as a ruinous monument of his downfall, a considerable remnant of the ultimate charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Killer Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "murder peace" you can make a brief process: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo's hackers, and who is in love with one of them.
Although it is commendable that here even the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evils, the TV film loses all too quickly in Geballer and action.
There remains a kind of "Alert for Cobra 11" without a motorway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be investigated in a very exemplary way, why there has never been a very good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who open up to detect the Serbian super-war criminal "the Fuchs" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and other book writer (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
For the stories are like striking: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times it will be a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that one does not simply let Simon Hunt be the downside cynic with his heart when he introduces us to us at the beginning.
No, the script must have another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the river, when the reporters in the last five minutes have succeeded in what NATO, the CIA and all the world's leaders have failed in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to the right.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against quinology.
The film has a deeper human concern.
He wants Karadzic and Mladic to continue to run freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (which should be exclusively agreed) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good community and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I can feel the murky hurdles: how hard it is to be evil".
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same hairheads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the nature of the Balkan war film.
Recently it was reported in this newspaper that all Iraqi films were big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always applies: If a star moves around the world's crisis shepherds or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Aside from all the borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It had to go away for decades before Hollywood could turn a good movie over the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are likely to mature - which are now the classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated in any way as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes home on the same two screens, just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the bookwriters of the carelessness they need to tell good stories.
"He or she" or "The Great dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcasticly distant artist view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change.
Cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Criticism for Olympia Absage
The withdrawal of the mayor from the Hamburg application for the Summer Olympics has been severely criticized in politics and economics.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But from Bust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
The chief businessman of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described on Wednesday as "not good for the place of business".
No other project has recently developed as large motivation forces in the city as the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the sport political momentum would not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to neglect the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "which comes out of a changed time radius".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with earlier statements, at least until 2028 the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Foundation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected to take place in early December on a Munich application for the Winter Games 2018.
"This preference means to us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period we have so far thought of."
Yet the dream wasn't dreaming all the time, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to get a chance to build up, by already eradicating the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply was also in opposition to the Senate statement on the occasion of a reception for the general meeting of the German University Sports Association.
There from Beust named the Hamburg application for the University 2015 "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD bourgeoision Group suggested that the Senate should not spend valuable time on housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map of Olympia and the building of the apartment," said SPD deputies Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Little Grassbrook has always required integrated planning for Olympia and later residential use, the CDU has put on the "Event Factor" side.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had sparked a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden box is thinking of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's workshop.
Most of the forty-nine Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After several months of doubt about Andy Warhol's reality of Brillo Boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to an end: the six Brillo Boxes, which the former museum director Pontius Hultén gave to the Moderna Museum in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of the approximately one hundred additional Brillo Boxes from the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is closed, a confusing combination of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol in New York created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes from paper: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cardonagen factory.
This was not about works of art, but about their examples, just pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol granted in 1968 the permission to let some Brillo wooden boxes be produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Modern Museum.
Modernists are now talking about about fifteen boxes that have then entered the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" right into the art and auction history.
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden by about one hundred wooden boxes in 1968 that Warhol had left him.
In fact, Huténs 105 boxes were produced in Malmö only in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Modern Museum, has also examined three of the six museum’s Brillo boxes from Swedish private possession, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press pads were first founded and melted, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies tells us that the color with a painter's role without foundation was applied directly to the press panel - it is not oil, it is acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," says the Director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York doesn't come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibitions."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has freely announced that the "serious charges" that will be raised in the matter of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, you have been hiding there in untimely silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up who have flocked to a hotel in Manila and demanded the destruction of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for the bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
The hotel had previously been stormed with tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hanging in the building for hours.
Around half of them stood before the court on Thursday because of a failed coup trial in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathians.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him were apparently overrun by him and joined his home.
They entered the Pennsylvania Hotel and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the area around the leading hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Her government has been overestimated for months of corruption.
Manila's financial district was already in 2003 the main scene of the attempted occupation of approximately 200 military members against Arroyo.
The rebellion broke out after almost 24 hours at the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
