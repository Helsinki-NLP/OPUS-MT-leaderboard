Wells Assembly members concerned that they "look like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly is a concern about the proposal to change their title to the MWP (Members of the Wells Parliament).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to "the Wells Parliament".
Members of the Assembly from all political spectrum are concerned that this may trigger complaints.
A member of the Laburiste Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wells: In wells, twp means "ass" and pwp means "cuckoo".
A member of the Wells Party said the whole group was "unsatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Wellsian Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the change of name, but he said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the expression "w" in wellsically is similar to that of "u" in Yorkshire's English.
The Assembly Commission that is currently drafting legislation to declare a change of name said: "Surely the final decision for the appointment of Assembly members will depend on the members themselves."
The Wells Government Act 2017 gave the Bellsian Assembly Tagr to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latest proposal for the Assembly's appointment as "the Wells Parliament" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the designation "Members of the Wells Parliament" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option found more support in a consultation with the public.
Members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative choices, but the war on reaching consensus can be turned into a turning point for President Elin Jones, from which the presentation of legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly is operated, including rules for the exclusion of Assembly Members and the structure of the committee system.
During the debate on legislation, the final vote on their appointment will remain for the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians are voting in the referendum on changing the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote for the change of their country's name in "North Macedonia Republic".
The people's vote was put in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a referendum opponent for the change of name, has said he will not recognise the votes.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is just the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin’s campaigns are silent, while the churches in Harlem face difficulties
" Historically, the elderly people I've talked to say there's been a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today both are missing."
He said the disappearance of the leaves is understandable.
"Today, people socialise in other ways," he says.
"The bars are no longer the place where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches could be replaced by palaces full of baths with people who would not support the holy places that remained in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy bathing environments in these palaces are white," he said, "so the days will soon come when these churches will close well, since it is unlikely that most of the people placed in these dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of colored people — the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white - method congregation was transferred in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was owned by a colorful congregation of people who had their own place of worship nearby.
Saint Martin passed a congregation of coloured people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority traders on the 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote colored people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but since Father Johnson's familitaries made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the carione.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir of St. Martin, called the chario with pride "the camp of the poor."
The expert who played the career in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and an "historic instrument irreplaceable."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also said that this was the first cartoon in the world played by a colorful musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin hadn't replaced her.
The events of the past months in St. Martin have been a complicated confession of contractors and contractors, some of whom were sent by church leaders and others from the episcopal diocese.
The Council -- the leading body of the Familiar, made up of the time-leader -- wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that it "would try to transfer costs" to the Familiar council, despite the fact that the latter was not involved in the employment of the architects and contractors sent from the diocese.
Some familiars complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Fishing the 13-year-old plague during a dive to catch frogs in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was sinking to catch forks in California on the day of the opening of the fork season, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's beach in Encinita.
Chad Hammel has voiced for KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been ingesting himself with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then had driven towards him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought the boy was just excited about getting caught, but then "I realized he was screaming "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he couldn't see that his whole clavicle was broken.
And he said unto them, I beckoned unto them all that they should go out of the water, saying, There is a fish in the water. And Hamle added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Rady's" children's hospital in San Diego, where he was declared critical.
The species responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was defined as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials stopped beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinita for 48 hours, for investigation and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sciencebury's plans to enter MB's cosmetic market
Sciencebury's is competing Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with big-store-style cosmetic pavilions, with a team of specialized salesmen.
Within the framework of a considerable effort to enter the US cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as sales of fashion clothes and household ornaments suffer decline, the largest cosmetic pavilions will be tested at 11 shops around the country and will be spread to more shops next year if they succeed.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are searching for ways to fill the once - used raft spaces for televisions, microwaves, and household rentals.
Sciencebury's said it would double its offer of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybellin and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, with dedicated areas for related markets, similar to those in shops like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-market its cosmetic line Boutique, so that most of the products are made up of vegan - something that is increasingly being demanded of new agers.
In contrast, the retailer of fragrances "Fragrance Shop" will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which has opened last week in Croydon, South London, while the second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a trend towards daily food purchases in small amounts in local stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sciencebury, has said that outlets will start to look more and more like big shops, while the supermarket network is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's price cuts with more services and consumer products.
Sciencebury's has placed Argos' outlets in hundreds of shops and presented a set of Habitats that after buying the two networks two years ago, which according to him has stimulated food sales and made them the most profitable purchases.
The previous effort by the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sciencebury's tested a association of companies with Boots in the early 2000s, but the association was fired after a debate on how to divide revenues from drugs into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business to 281 Celesio shops, owners of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for 125 million pounds.
He said "Lloyds" would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the view of our cosmetic pavilions to improve the environment in favour of our clients.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, which will be ready for advice.
The range of our brands is designed in such a way as to suit any needs, and the attractive environment and the desirable locations show that we are now a cosmetic destination, which makes a difference to the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "whispered" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million pounds agreement
The star of "Dragons Den", Peter Jones, has gone "hinded" since TV show Holly Willoughby has been drawn from an 11 million pounds deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home oriental brand and Truly accessory.
The business of these two was compared to Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter "This Morning" addressed Instagram to declare its departure.
Holly Willoughby has pissed off the "Dragons Den" star, Peter Jones, after the recent withdrawal from their lucrative business dedicated a certain lifestyle - to focus on its new promising contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
The sources say Jones was "feeled" when the golden girl of television accepted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- meant that she had no longer had time to dedicate their home oriental brand and accessories to "Truly".
The business was compared to Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double its estimated worth of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, was addressed to Instagram to declare her departure from "Truly", Jones has flew outside of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source has said: "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long future that would accompany her during the next decades.
Its decision to withdraw left all the people involved absolutely stuck.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close.
Offices in Marlow have a warehouse full of goods that are ready to sell."
Experts believe that the removal of the presenter "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, can cost millions to the firm, due to considerable investment in products starting from sheets and candles to household clothes and furniture, and cause further delays in its opening.
And this could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as her director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 per cent of the shares in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become a brand ambassador for the M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the "I'm A Celebrity" or ITV presenter.
Last night, a source near Jones has said "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
Strong talk "and then love's ram"
He made a joke about criticism that he would receive from the news media because of his comment, which some would call him "not worthy of a president", and because of the positiveness associated with North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
Trump said by mocking the voice of news reporters.
"I didn't give up at all."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, since their first meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards the cnuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for cinuclinarization have been cut off.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's major diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North sees no "response" from the US towards the first steps taken by North Korea for nuclearisation.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping it under pressure.
Trump held a much more optimistic view of his meeting talk.
"The things are getting better with North Korea," he said.
"We were going into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have brought positive results - interrupting the missile testing, helping to release the hostages and returning home to the rest of the American soldiers.
In his speech about his relationship with Kim, he protected his unusual approach.
"It's very easy to act as President, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people staying there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign nonprofit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population, no national disaster has been declared, which is a precondition for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it clear in many cases that they do not seek international support, the matter is a little challenging," Mrs. Sombang said.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Paul, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
In view of the frequent fluctuations of Indonesia’s land, the country remains very unprepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
While shelters against tsunami have been built in Aceh, they rarely appear in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the warning of the tsunami in Paul, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in better conditions, traveling among many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the earthquake victims is traveling to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Yoko Widodo has used Indonesia's rapid infrastructure to improve as the central point of his electoral campaign, and has invested a lot of generous money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has disturbed Mr. Yoko's administration, while he faces the new elections that will take place next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the clashes of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, using knives, arrows, and other cold weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge marks in the last few minutes an equivalent goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge has rescued Liverpool from a loss at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passport from Gerdan Shaqiri to be located about 30 yards away from Chelsea's gate, while his team was losing with the result 1-0.
He pushed the ball easily to his left before he hit the remote door.
The ball flew over the area until it turned to the right and top of the network.
The ball saved the Kepa Arizabalaga air and ended up in the net.
"The point was to put myself in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch and I didn't think too long but just hit."
Chelsea led with the 1-0 result in the first part, after a goal in the 25th minute of the Belgian Eden Hazard star.
Blue attacker made a review at Mateo Kovacic during that game, before rotating near the field and sprinting toward the Liverpool peninsula.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave him a beautiful vertical belt that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense at a speed duel and with a left shot marked on the second pillar, passing the ball behind the arms of the Liverpool Portier, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of dead from the tsunami in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased in 832, the national disaster agency has voiced in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have been trapped under the ruins of buildings modeled by the 7.5-face earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo at a press conference.
The city of Paul, with a population of more than 380,000, is located under the ruins of exemplary buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman gets killed by a knife wound
A murder investigation has been reported after the wife's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife-induced injuries at Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as suspected of murder.
The police have called on residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to present for witness.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The heat is in the early stages, but I'd like to call on anyone who's been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught up in film shows, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and her body is found inside a residence.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew her had come to the stage to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, while the police have said it is announcing the victim's family.
A resident taxi driver in Grayson Mews has attempted to enter his apartment, but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He remained silent when he discovered the event.
People are now being informed that they will only be allowed to enter their homes in a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated like a crime scene.
A woman has arrived in the scene of crime.
She keeps saying, "That's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter, and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned within the perimeter, monitoring the dwelling block.
Each person with information is asked to send a direct message @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimesthoppers" anonymously in number 0800 555 111 by selecting code 247 September 30th.
Statue of Cromwell in Parliament, the last monument touched by the debate on "rewrite of history"
Its removal would be a worthy punishment for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its Puritan fanatic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a surprise" and "an effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the middle of the current debate on the abolition of statues, it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was consecrated.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a wrong sacrifice to Cromwell for his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Cromwell's excellent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the story of a figure that many think deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said about "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a parliament's defender from external pressure, which was certainly, in his case, the monarchy.
The fact that this is a perfectly accurate portrait is the subject of continuous historical discussions.
What is certain is that the 17th-century conflict gave shape to our nation's further development, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure that represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Until the killer of the plague for the Chinese farmer's death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his nickname "Yuan", was found intact with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pig stable in the market of Liupanshiu in Guizhou province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to inject the pig vaccine at a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him empty and discovered the door of a pig stable nearby.
He said there was a large male pig in the stable with blood on his mouth.
A medical examination has confirmed that up to 550 pounds has injured the farmer for death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and bleeding," said his cousin identified with the nickname "Wu," as quoted in the news of the evening in Guiyang.
In security camera footage, Yuan is seen entering the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has reported on evening news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs - attacked people have been noted earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing her husband serious injury.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound [650 kg] pig caught up with a wellsian farmer after his tractor, while his husband drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was slaughtered by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that normally pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "stimulation".
"They just want to play.
They're like very curious babies... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The consequences of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring large rows of wide stretches to the U.S. Southeast
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is waning as it moves toward the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the next few days, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the southwest US.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m., Rosa was accompanied by wind speeding 85 miles per hour, classified as Category 1, and found 385 miles in Southeast Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean, a low atmospheric pressure zone is beginning to form, which is moving towards the East, towards the West Bank of the United States.As Rosa is expected to approach the Bay of California peninsula on Monday in the wake of a tropical storm, she will continue to push the great tropical wet to the north, towards the south-west US.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Later, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low atmospheric pressure zone will cause heavy rains in the southwest during the following days.
At the local level, rainfalls of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, floods of wastes, and possible flooding of the land in the desert.
The tropical high rainfall will make it possible to reach the rate of rainfall in certain areas up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and Southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches are predicted in some Southeast areas, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical droughts.
Because of the danger of tropical rains, it is not recommended to walk through deserts on foot.
Large rows can turn canyons into powerful rivers, and strings will bring strong winds and storms of dust into the area.
The nearness of the low atmospheric pressure zone will bring heavy rains to some parts of the southern coast of California.
The total level of nets can reach over half an inch, causing small waste streams and trashy roads.
For the region, these will be the first rows of the rainy season.
Some tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona on Sundays and Mondays in the morning, before the rains spread on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Strong lines will be distributed on four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. can be characterized by major temperature fluctuations, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example is the dramatic difference in temperatures across the Central US on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the following days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the Central and Eastern US is expected to start October with warm temperatures, on average 80, from the South Fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
The New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high odds for temperatures above the average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial session
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that is suspected to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political blockades continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the return in the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford expressed to the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent certain that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to take him to a gymnastics party.
Kavanaugh, in a flash of evidence, said that it was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that the number of followers has been greater than that of 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The figures for other broadcasting networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the viewers from the offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or to that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led the other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
The ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to remain high even after the end of the judicial session.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced protestors' riots while trying to get to the elevator to go to the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In the transmission of CNN's books, he appeared looking down for a few minutes while being corrected.
"I'm staying here, facing you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power, while there are so many helpless women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering directly the moment when the Judicial Committee would vote for the pass of Kavanaugh's candidacy for vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do this only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate during the next week, as the minority democrats had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made a decision.
The Flake election was smart, since it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to withdraw from the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brexit, so-called "Checkers", saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay taxes on each other is "incredibly absurd".
Wayde Sims gun murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Dieteon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison environments under the charge of unsuspecting murder, Baton Rouge Police Directorate has said.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims had lost his eyes during the fight.
Police have found eyes on the scene and say they have found Simpson's DNA track in them, reports CBS WAFB's branch.
After Simpson's questioning, the police said he's admitted that he's got a gunshot on Wayde causing him to die.
The amount for his release is set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Medical Office of the Eastern Town of Baton Rouge has issued a preliminary report on Friday, expressing that the cause of death has been a wound caused by firearms from head to neck.
The Department thanks the task force of the refugees near the Louisiana State Police, the state police criminalist's lab, the Southern University police and the area's citizens for helping with investigations leading to the author's arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the area's legislative authorities for "their soul and for putting justice in the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six - foot - long six - inch - tall boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had also played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, coach of LSU basketball team Will Wade said the team was "pained" and "comforted" by Wayde's death.
"That's why we're worried all the time," Wade said.
Volcano Praises Mexico City
Hurish from Volcano Popcatepetl has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was reawakened and 183 gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a number of crops and pests.
Social media images showed fine layers of snow that had covered the car windows in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, since a 7.1-degree earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the independence poll anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the pro-independence protestors and peacekeepers clashed, while thousands have joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalan's polarisation vote.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful police forces, were struck with eggs and powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually gnaw from tourists.
Later during the day there was also cocooning, while the police had to use the tire sticks to end the strikes.
For a few hours in a row, repeating the phrase "We don't forget, we don't forgive," pro-independence groups confronted the Unionist protestors who were shouting "Rofta Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for easy injuries received during protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings of independence prevail, tensions continue to remain high one year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, regardless of whether participation was low, since citizens against separation boycotted the votes.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the polls at the polling stations in the region through violent strikes.
On Friday's evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another flow.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalana would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best things.
I saw my parents in tears of joy that they would be able to vote, but now we are trapped," he said.
Despite the fact that in the local elections last December they achieved a vital victory, although with a narrow result, the pro-independence Catalan parties have been difficult to keep track of this year, since many of their most well-known leaders have or have voluntarily left the country or are in custody and awaiting judgment on their role in organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering the protest on his phone with police, said the conflict was fueled by the politicians of both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who is in prison waiting for the trial that ended last year, said he would run for the European Parliament next year's elections.
"The candidacy for European elections is the best way to oppose the return of democratic values and the pressure that the Spanish government has given us," he said.
Londonderry: Some arrested after the car hits the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car has been hit several times by a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage has been caused at the main gate and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at an appointed time a arrow has been fired toward the car.
Menga's strike excused Livingston a 1-0 victory against Rangers
First goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured victory
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerard to lose his second 18 matches as a team coach from Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga hit proved decisive while Gary Holt's team matched the second-country hibernian point.
Gerard's team hasn't won an out-of-the-field meeting in the Premiership this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But before that, Rangers will wait at Rapid Vienna's house in a valuable match for the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended the series of consistent winners to six meetings and Coach Holt has not yet experienced the loss since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingstone loses chances in front of unresolved opponents
Holt's team should have gone through many minutes before they signed, since their direct attacks caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to get through but he hit the weak in the door, and then Alan Lithgow hit out on the top and after the head chase by Craig Halkett.
The villages were willing to leave Rangers to play ahead of them, knowing that they could cause problems in the standard strikes.
And that's how the goal was to set the meeting.
Rangers caused a stroke and Livingston created space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the possibility of Menga, which struck and marked the center of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated the holding of the ball but the local defense had proved unbearable and Porter Liam Kelly had almost never been tested,
This kind of game continued in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to wait.
Scott Pittman's strike was stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor's porter while Lithgow hit off another standard Lifeston hit.
The raids continued to come to the Livingston area and were constantly cleaned, while two charges against the Penalties - after Halket's intervention against the player who came as deputy Glenn Middleton, and another hand-to-hand touch - were not taken into consideration.
Mankind's Phenomenal Game - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
For one man, they played fine and continued to surpass expectations in this increasing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since they got back to the top, but a great reward belongs to Holt for how he's electrified the team since it came.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept him in trouble with Connor Goldson and Joe Worall throughout the match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerard’s direction, they lacked quality.
The missing final pass--only once they managed to pass the counter-defence--and this is something that should serve as an alarm to Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is expected with confused feelings in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by a clear heavenly smile while Turkish and German leaders met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have been in conflict with issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Later, Erdogan went to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police stopped the meeting of a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many supporters went out on the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan -- many of whom were Kurds -- also raised their voice to condemn Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposition protests reflect the divisive power of a visitor worshiped as a hero by some German Turks and humiliated as autocrats by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after car crash
A cyclist has found death after being hit by a car in London.
The incident happened near the Bestword Street crossing with Evelyn Street, a traffic road loaded in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car manager stopped, and the ambulances came right away, but the victim turned his life around.
The battle took place a few months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which occurred at Childers Street, about a mile away from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police reported that officers were working to identify the person and to notify his family.
Roads are closed and buses are announced to use other roads, while car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long High Prison: Six Officers Injured During a Rebellion
Six prison officers have been injured during a riot in a high-security prison for men, the Prison Office has said.
The rebellion exploded at HMP Long High in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST Sunday, and still continues.
Specialist officers of "Tornado" have been called to keep the riots under control, including eight prisoners and who have been confined within one arm of the prison.
Officers have been treated locally for some minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "The prison staff with specialized training is mobilized to keep under control the incident currently taking place in the HMP Long High.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will be referred to the police and may take longer prison sentences".
HMP Long Martin shelters over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was subjected to hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peace police officers were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which can bring benefits to drought zones)
Although it is rare that tropical depression will strike Arizona, this is probably exactly what will happen on the first days of the next week, while the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, spreading the risk of immediate flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings for immediate flooding for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday’s rainy Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received the status of storm or tropical depression in a 200-mile line from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Urban Centre predict 2 to 4 insulating, with the amount isolated up to 6 ins on the Mogollon border in Arizona.
In other desert areas in the Southwest, including central Rockies and the Great Base, rows are expected to be 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's deserts can be a blessing, since the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these may be beneficial, since the southwest is currently facing dark conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for the Monitoring of Gravity, little more than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing the extreme thickness of the second category," weather.com reported.
Initially, Hurricane Rosa will hit the California Bay of Mexico.
Rosa, still powerfully hurricaneed on Sunday morning, with wind speeding up to 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm is facing cold waters over the Pacific, and power is being lost.
Consequently, the hurricane is expected to strike Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or at the evening of the moon.
Rainfalls over some areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting considerable risks to flooding.
"The rain of an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonor, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, on the verge of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday.
"The main risk expected by Rosa or its consequences are strong rebounds in Baja California, the northwest Sonor and in the southwest desert of the US," the National Urban Centre said.
These streams are expected to cause immediate flooding at risk of life, waste streams in the deserts, and landfills in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: Four arrests for remaining attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspected of remaining attempted murder, following the wound of a 16-year-old with a knife in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He joined the hospital, where he is currently in "sustainable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for the presentation of anyone who may have received a cell phone video from the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a meeting in West Virginia Wheeling.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress Thursday, conscientiously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's charge that he had sexually attacked him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the session on her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "the American people bore witness to the greatness, character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most thoughtful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean record of public service," he said before the group of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president emphatically mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during his talk on the importance of Republican participation in the timely elections.
"Five weeks are divided by one of the most important elections in our lives.
I will not run, but I am contributing," he said.
"I'm trying so hard and I'm fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to "resistance and blockade".
The Senate's first main procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN Assistant Director of the GOP said
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, while numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were hit by giant waves that hit the beaches, when the island of Sulawes in Indonesia was hit by a earthquake and tsunami, the authorities expressed themselves on Saturday.
Hundreds themselves were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the dolphins up to six meters (18 feet) collapsed on the shore in the muscose, attempting to cause the death of many people and destroying everything that came forward.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 - foot - high earthquake.
"The day before yesterday, when the tsunami threat was born, people were still doing their usual activities on the beach, and as a result they did not run away immediately and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency, said at a press conference.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he took with him cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had walked the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the shoreline.
Some people climbed the tree to save the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, broken bridges and excavated buildings, and a glass surrounded by water.
The post - quake strikes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake range was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) expressed in a statement that the energy emitted by the massive Friday earthquake was about threefold the power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is at the edge of a long and narrow loop, may have multiplied the power of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great excess" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were exemplary.
Some corpses were found trapped under the ruins of exemplary buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been killed.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the scale of damage could be much larger along the 300km (190 miles) coastline in northern Palau, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication networks "completely interrupted without any warning" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
The area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and its volunteers were traveling towards the affected areas.
"This has already become a tragedy, but the situation may get worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not giving notice of Paul’s beating from the tsunami, despite the fact that officials expressed their fears when warning was given.
In amateur films distributed in social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard by warning passersby down the street about the coming of the angry bell.
Within a few minutes, a dam bursts into the shore, taking the building and the car with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive energy interruption, which cut off communications across Paul, making it difficult to coordinate efforts to save from authorities.
The army has begun to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is only reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The number of victims from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
While the World Vision staff from Dongala have arrived without problems in the city of Palu, where workers are staying in inter-racial shelters in their office yard, they witnessed the scene of destruction on the road, said Mr. Dossaba.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very difficult.
Although relief groups began serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were stopping them from traveling to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As the government says "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can ask for national aid, but this status has not yet been given".
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Paul’s day, friends and families of the deceased still had the hope that the occasion of their loved ones would be among the few miracles that sometimes occur in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a well.
On Saturday, the rescue forces released a woman who had remained under the rubble for two days, with her mother’s corpse near her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national team of prejudice, had trained two of the missing preshutists for the Asian Games, which were closed early this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people blocked at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of prejudice, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the "Roa Roa" hotel among the community of prejudice, he had desperately tried to write to the WhatsApp competitors from Paul, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages ended only with a gray scale mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 while refilling a ATM in Newport in Levee
According to a press statement from the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some thieves have stolen $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was refilling a ATM in Newport, Levee.
The car manager had been emptying a ATM in a entertainment center and trying to spread money, Detective Dennis wrote in the statement.
While he was busy with work, someone "comes running after Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money dedicated to surrender.
According to the statement, the witnesses had seen some suspects leaving the scene, but the police have not specified the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact Newport police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The line changes its name to Ye
The Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It's officially known as Kanye West".
41-year-old West has been called with Ye's nofka from time to time, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which appeared on the market in June.
The change came shortly before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandi".
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Compared to being a shortcut to his current name of art, West has said in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "yes" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said at the beginning of this year, talking about his album's title with the radio presentation Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we're us.
I left Kanye, which means "only," in just "Ye," which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known differently than Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has done as he did with or without a dividend visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged that he will never use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching its 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "he will never use the army to press the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military forces set fire to the peaceful demonstrators on the streets, killing 300 people, at a time when the students ’ left movements were rising throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more public universities free of charge.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education push young people towards criminal gangs.
US needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US has to double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and expert of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after various parts of the U.S. government have reported discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the lack of a general official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"Distribution of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, since the other countries are still far behind the US and we are looking for a great turnout in this field," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that the major future achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will be made in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's finest artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed to the leading American player in Othello, and later worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised previous US government competitions for technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Field, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help identify new visionaries.
Lee said often, US researchers need to work hard to get grants from the government.
"It's not China that is removing academic leaders; it's corporations," Lee said.
Over the past few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked mind-blowing from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can help the US push its efforts into the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to doctors with the title in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Nature Sciences in China provides funding for people in academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to include partners from industry and the academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called "AI Next".
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, American legislation aimed at establishing a National Commission for Safety for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to determine whether its name would change to "the Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory, and has set up a blocking veto for its membership in NATO and in the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of most slaves of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has cast doubt on whether election participation will reach 50 per cent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question in the referendum vote sheet reads: "Are you for NATO and EU membership through the accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by Yugoslavia's dissolution, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, as this implies a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will retain the result of the vote to make it decisive.
Name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, voting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I am going to vote for my children, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, voters in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of Macedonia's name, which will pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and was setting a career in front of chairs set up by referendum boycotters.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not by entering the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't love us as Macedonia, we can address other states like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote was cast.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum -- a figure below the required level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants had plans to vote on Sunday.
Among these, 70 per cent said they would vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the participation scale should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first strong blow to the pro-Western government's policy, since its arrival in power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defenses in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
Argentina's hunter received a bribe in the middle at the start of the action.
He cut through the three Brighton defenders before he went out in the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green blouses.
He crossed a protector and quickly drove some others into Brighton's area.
Then he followed the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker took advantage of his exit into the area to follow the Agueros ball, which hit the right and crossed the portier Matthew Ryan by throwing the ball on the right corner of the network.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," City's manager, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the knights the first advantage in the Prime Minister League's match.
This target was marked in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in Brighton's middle.
He was pretty verticalizing for Laroy Sane on the left.
Sane took a few steps before following you to Sterling on the second column.
The cat attacker took the ball to the net and then pulled it out of the bounding lines.
The city will face Hofenheim in the valuable challenge for the Champions League group phase on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to save the role of "swifter" against Rockies
With the nationals eliminated by the chance to achieve the eliminations, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is the possibility of a playoff for Rockies, who have an advantage over Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockies got at least one chance for the playoff due to winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to get the title of the division.
"Even though we're playing without any motive, at least we can notice by recognizing the atmosphere of fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level that I can face throughout the year.
Why didn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will be entitled on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to leave Scherzer to start the meeting in such situations.
Scherser, for whom the 34th performance would be as a headline, held a training session Thursday and could appear in the Sunday field, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
The player from Washington, who shot right, is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 of the shootings this season.
Trump gathers Western Virginia in meeting
The president referred to the situation with regard to his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before talking about the importance of Republican participation in the timely elections.
"The Nator is decisive for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks are spent in one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group of radical democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they have divided their minds so that they may regain power in any way, you see their humiliation and their filth.
They don't want to know who they are; or who they are who are pressed on foot to take power and control. This is what they want, power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resistance and blockade".
"And you have seen this in the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "inflamed, cruel, filthy and unfaithful."
He was referred to as the Democratic President of the Senate Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, which gave rise to a brunt of dissatisfaction from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you made the document known?
Well, well, what?
No, well, no, I... wait a minute... - her body language was pretty bad--it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Work Party is no longer an open church.
She's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief against me, they did not live up to it.
Finally, I am not the first of the Members of the Working Party who are told that they are not welcome - all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, just because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me about the agreement with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy was opposed to previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Working Party meeting, it was said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year period as local MPs of the Working Party, GC meetings have been both.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and more polite" policy has been forgotten for some time if ever existed.
It has become increasingly evident that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Working Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought shared similar political views began claiming that I would take a 180-degree turn and maintain positions with which I would never agree -- whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public -- no matter what I say -- they blow up criticism in the social media, with people asking for my discharge, they denouncing central politics, they tell me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And this isn't just me.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but who are not.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Working Party should feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a "open church", and with every motion of faith and any change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more and more closed.
Over the past two years, I've been advised to lower my head, not to be so noisy, and so everything "will be fine".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago as a school student, encouraged by the disregard of the Thatcher government that led my class to failure in a general school, I have tried to praise for better public services for those who need more -- whether as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear political positions and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will touch our families, businesses and public services, and I can't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to follow is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether or not members of the Working Party: I am proud of being in your service and I promise you that no threat to discharge or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose — The Invincible Father Guides the Lists
The two late attempts may have changed somewhat the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely entertaining game of Tennant's Premiership today.
Now they lead the lists as the only invincible team among ten teams.
Finally, it was their wonderful protection and the courage to take the risk of winning the local team, and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be completely satisfied.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, against normally I'm happy," he said.
Robby Christie of Melrose said, "We want to congratulate the Air team, who took more risks than we did".
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, released by Frazier Climo, took advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to show numerical superiority and Jason Baggot received an unused top.
Climo raised Ayr's advantage with a penultimate while shortly before the end of the first part, he scored and returned to the goal of an individual action leading the result to Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose took up the second part and tried Patrick Anderson, a target from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long interruption as a result of Ruarid Knott's serious injury, which left with a barrel, and after the game was resumed, Ayr increased the result through an attempt by Stafford McDowall, signed by Climo.
Captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with yellow cards, and Melrose again took advantage of the fact that they had an extra player, with an unscrupulous attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a piece of hard press.
However, the locals returned, and when Straan Hutchinson was punished with a yellow card because he blocked the Climo, without a top, from the penal line, MacPherson made "touch down", behind the back of Ayr's three (small) advance.
Climo scored and did the same almost after the game was restored, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led ahead the attacker Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
The Still Game star seems set for a new career in the restaurant industry
The "Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry, as it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in BBC's famous show, with co-scenarian and co-protagonist partner in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphil.
The suspect has announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Arigermorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source for Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was trying to enter the "flowering restaurant industry" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without leaving the sea hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an improvisation of the marine fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have built the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca in Amazon, the motto is: "The sea is our property.
Its recovery is a task."
Throughout Bolivia without leaving the sea, the memory of getting the coast from Kili in a bloody 19th century source conflict is still quite alive -- as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1st, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five - year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hooves, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course, it is looking forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that -- after decades of irregular discussions -- Killi is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory off the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president -- who is facing a controversial battle for taking the second term in the elections next year -- the Monday's decision is very important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts think there's very little chance that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia -- and that even if they did, they would change little.
The United Nations headquarters organ in the Netherlands does not have the touch to give another state part of Kila's territory, and it has been said that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is issuing a decision only six months after hearing the final arguments indicates that the issue "was not complicated", Paz Zarate, an expert on international law, said.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, events in the past four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric has disappeared every trace of remaining kindness to the Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Kili will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult for discussions to take place after that.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was strangely quick.
On Monday, he will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disputes, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia would never give up her right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave behind the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place for as long as it can't trust the US
North Korea Foreign Minister New Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm nuclear weapons, as long as it cannot trust Washington.
A new talk was given on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be in the process of resurrecting nuclear diplomacy so far "screaming", more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
According to Rei, hopes that the US's continued sanctions and opposition to the Korean War End Declaration will make North Korea kneel down are empty hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make important dissipation movements, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's goal to attract its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant chapels that will soon come on your city streets
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or provide full protection from the sun’s rays, do not search any further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of huge weird hats for their SS19 collection at the parlour, which left all the stylists open in the Fashion Week in Paris.
The highly unpractice chapels have been given into Instagram this summer, and these stylists have brought their surprising creations into the hall.
The special creation of Valentinos was a very extravagant beaver, decorated with a wide living room with details similar to the doll, which surrounded the model’s head.
Other large accessory included stone-fibrous sausages, a magic hat, and even a pineapple -- but they are not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - both in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sharp lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than a coat of mail.
One creation was like diving equipment, filled with also the air tube and water glasses, while another was like a molten ice bucket.
And if you like to follow this brave way - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon come to your city’s streets.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of La Bomba, the two-legged cast hat we've all seen, starting from Rihanna and up to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand hiding behind the chapel was very impractical that it was taken through social media, and it produced another great creation in the gateway - a bag of wooden beaches, almost as big as the model of the bathroom that was holding it.
The bag of reddish-colored orange, decorated with reddish and with a white leather handle on top, was the most special creation of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in the Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous personality stilist Luke Armitage reported to FEMAIL: "In the next summer I predict seeing hats and huge beach bags on the streets of the cities -- since the stilist has left a big impact so difficult to ignore requirements for large accessors".
John Edward: Key linguistic skills for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold a record of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent results in trials, further strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at higher levels, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can prepare and implement an appropriate educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the modern - language branch continues to be a popular and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, your words go to his ears.
If thou speak with him in thine own tongue, then thy words shall enter into his heart.
These words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to establish relations with people from foreign lands.
From the results of this year's recent trials, we can see that languages are leading the results list, with the highest degree of passing notes among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the highest score A.
Data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied for German, 69 per cent of those who studied for French and 63 per cent of those who studied for Spanish had also received grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, the foreign language branch is considered as important as the STEM branch (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the main challenges faced by employers for the completion of the countries, 17 per cent of them were related to the lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
In addition to the jobs that are conditional on the possession of foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a YeGov survey, involving over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation, and France was the only foreign language spoken by a percentage of people with 2 digits, specifically 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
The ownership of many languages, and especially the ownership of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as regards the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the future of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages you can choose in private schools, with a pedagogical staff made up of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are committed to offering a school environment that will prepare children and "armarate" them with the necessary skills to cope with them, regardless of the future.
At this time, the fact that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the country's future must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capability".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron is expected to start with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
It's almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six pre-season games program.
"I don't need pre-season matches in this phase of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump gathering time in Western Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump, launches a series of elections tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first gathering of such five planned to hold next week, including stops in friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval they suspend his election to complete the empty country in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to provide support for future timely elections as Republicans risk losing control in Congress when the elections are held in November.
At what time does the Trump meeting take place today in Western Virginia, and how do we follow it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. east time tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can track Trump's gathering in Western Virginia online below, via direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address hearing sessions this week at the Supreme Court of the candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was stressed because of charges of his unwarranted sexual conduct, with the expected vote of confirmation by the remaining Senate suspended for one week while the FBI was conducting the case investigations.
But the primary objective of these many gatherings is to help the Republicans take a step forward in the face of November's elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign staff said that these five meetings next week aim "to give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible as we address the tight campaign season," a trumpet campaign spokesman, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters.
Planned to be held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's gathering can bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits Western Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for Western Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been behind polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a push in the poll," said Simon Hader, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team showed readiness to fight while holding their hopes alive by addressing the competitions until Sunday
After three consecutive seasons, the remaining four for the afternoon of Sunday, could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This twist of the wheel is a completely created sports concept, but a concept where players really believe in it and never more than in such competitions.
But where can we say that this noise is now felt?
"They had a six-point separation that has now gone into four, so we can say that a kind of trust was created to some extent," Jordan Spieth said as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points ahead when they remain in play and twelve points.
As Spyth states, Americans hope that the snares are in their favor and have many things to encourage, especially in the form of Spyth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long when they took three out of four possible points.
Spythe has been ruthless from the start of shooting to the grave and is leading by giving his example.
The festival’s brochures increased as the round followed, introducing the golf course with an easy shot to bring the match into balance when he and Thomas were first two points down after two rounds.
His easy shot that gave them the victory in the 15th tomb was expected with a similar booklet, which shows that he believes that the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your fight," Spieth said.
All the players left now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spyth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but devout European couple has accomplished four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't take a shot at the minimum Saturday morning, but they also avoided the minimum Sunday morning, Friday evening, and the second Friday morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow to the enthusiastic crowd and the anasthelas reinforces the idea that they are players to be able to get on Sunday and that there will be no other player known more than Fleetwood and Molinar to mark a possible European victory, while the sun sets on "Le Golf National".
Maybe both at the same time in different holes.
However, statements on a European triumph are still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy for Sergio Garcia, the four - morning hero of the game when he got married to Alex Noren.
One point on the minimum and two two to the ninth front placed Spain and Sweden in a cave from which they had no chance of coming out.
However, on Sunday no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
The games of the four and a couple are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which they can change a strategy there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the end, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still be fighting, even though some people, especially the Stateside, have decided on this.
Europe heads 10-6 as it goes toward the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a fundamental advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup since it came out of the four games and with couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspiring doubt of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-time competition against a Tiger Woods that was difficult to increase their advantage in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, offered to take the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the powerless American team in two morning matches, leading it to a 3-1 series of results.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in the fourth game, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the difference.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinar, who are headed by 'Molliwood' after a sensational ending, are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup who win four points in their four open matches.
After drumming Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth game, they combined quite well together to enable a powerless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5+4 result.
Woods, who held two meetings with difficulty on Saturday, showed repeated explosions of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game four and with couples and 7 consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, retired for the four-morning match, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the match with couples and received a 2+1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka -- ranked in the first and third countries in the world.
Europe had nothing in favour of a very beautiful and fresh day in southwest Paris.
Three times, professional winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the difference between the two - point Americans on Saturday.
They won a courageous 2+1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four matches and later returned to Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the match with the couple after they had lost in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned the result after a difference between four points in the individual games, although the Fury carrier team only needs an equation to keep the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems to pass their chances.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed “in any way” unilaterally without winning faith
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions on Saturday were deepening the mistrust of the United States, and the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
New Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant steps showing good will" last year, such as the banning of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing areas and vowing it will not add nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we are seeing no response to this from the US," he said.
"Without faith in the US, our national security will not have self-confidence, and in these circumstances there is no way we can unify our first.
While Rei reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to a separate "in-phase" approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be evaluated due to its gradual steps, his statement seemed important because it did not exclude unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Penianni had previously done.
The new referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between an American president in office and the Korean-North leaders in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested an official conclusion of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has expressed that the Peniani must first withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to mitigate international severe sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that 'nuclear waste' be carried out initially and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal compulsorily, even by opposing 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bend us is dreams in the sun of people who are not informed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
The new didn't mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that the US leader earlier stressed during this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae in the past five months and added: "If it were for South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula would not have come to this without a roadmap."
Nevertheless, the tone used in the New Speech was fundamentally different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the location of the US territory under the direction of the North Korean missile was inevitable after "Mr. President Djalli" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that it would "completely destroy" North Korea thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking the steps to be taken, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea carries out nuclear disarmament.
Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penian for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we carry out the full and final verification of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the financing of the Penian nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with the new side at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Penián again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go so well.
He left Pennsylvania in July saying he had made progress, and only within a few hours North Korea denounced him for having done "the Mafia style request."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to fill a missile area and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "relevant measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "related measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump pledged in Singapore and the movement towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students get lectures on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of study 'mass' through the use of caffeine by these 'insomnia'.
One academic observed that university students number one in the world often have no knowledge when it comes to basics than how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Grave, prepared the lecture course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a reference to the influence that sleep has on the learner.
'At last a girl approached me and said to me, 'Why is this saying to me now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had talked to her about the importance of sleep -- something that surprised me,' he said about 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to present this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour includes a series of interoperable tasks.
On the one hand, it is a view of a convex room, where students click on the cupcakes of coffee, peaches, athletes and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of the routine of hours to be spent in bed.
In another part, the participants were explained as looking out for sleep over a long period of time increasing the risk of heart attack, ishemia, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know, the health effect when you choose to smoke," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride to spend 'a night of idleness' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a permanent and growing problem.
The assurance that you have received enough sleep, of a good quality, must be the students' 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to a hungery mode, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Cheisler prepare the course, having participated in one of his lessons last year’s lessons in Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study program before joining competing institutions.
Prof. Cheisler recommended that students should set a watch with zeal when they should go to bed, and also when they should wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of the 'blue light' coming out of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can lead to the biological rhythm of sleep out at work, which leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga marks against Gerard's boys
Rangers received another hit as a visitor while Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerard's disbanded side a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was seeking to record his first victory since February 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused his second loss in 18 Gerrard matches as a coach, leaving his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Primership's escaped leader, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before finishing the first part and with a set of Rangers team that seemed totally powerless to balance.
While Rangers now fall in sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is directly behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
Rangers may expect more trouble after their arm player Calum Spence was treated for a hit in the head after it was hit by an object likely thrown by visiting typhoons.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which went through Air to the Bethfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt, launched the same 11th century that seized a point of Hearts last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team killed the opponents in each round.
Rangers may have dominated the holding of the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in his possession.
They should have scored only two minutes from the start of the meeting, when Menga gave Scott Pittman in the gate square protected by Allan McGregor, he did not use it exactly by shooting the ball out.
A long cross from the execution of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out on the back of the door.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed that they hoped more than they really believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after three hours of playing while he and Steven Lawless were beaten, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to make two hits at the front door, but former porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, didn't worry about hitting Lassana Coulibaly's head and hitting Ovie Ejaria's powerless.
While Liv's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was seen in the field, but no one could deny that they deserved it only for the argument they showed.
Serish Rangers failed in the service of long passports for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball toward Scott Robinson, who kept the peace to pass Menga and to mark in a simple way.
Gerard acted on the break between the parts while Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent and this change for a little while did not have an immediate effect while the escort followed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran away from his position to block him.
But Livingston kept making the guests play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halkett had a long ball with each other every once in a while.
Holt's team could stretch its lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacob before Lithgow shot out of a ball taken from the singing.
Ranger's deputy, Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he was confused with Jacobs, but Thomson again allowed the advantage.
Almanac: Geiger Meter's Splendor
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, like today 136 years ago and in VAZDIM... the day when the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger's measurement.
A main pillar of science since then, Matthew Geiger became a main pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950's film "Coronado Days," with a cast of non-professional actors such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set these limits, you can really hear the effects of atoms released from radioactive activity into minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" the bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them to a laboratory
They can 'get out' a protein that's usually found in many types of cancer and then reinject.
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize bad cells noticed that ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient, changing them to the laboratory so that they ‘expose’ a protein that is found frequently in some types of cancer called HER2, and then in the reinjection of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show us that we have to do with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of some types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lungs and the colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to the withdrawal of immune cells from patients "to teach them how to discover cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West appeared at a Pro-Trump meeting, wearing a hat with the cover of the MAGA, after its appearance in the SNL.
Don't cry properly.
Kanye West was aired with studio protests during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, following a disappointing interpretation where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for this post in 2020.
After interpreting his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was holding on to a hat that wrote "Make America Great", he continued to speak with us strongly against the Democrats and renegotiated his support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white person and they tell me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a parody of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star played Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Commission on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West speech recordings were uploaded to social media outlet Chris Rock.
It remains unclear if Rock is trying to make fun of West with that mail or not.
West also complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the backseat because of what he had put in his head.
"They treated me badly in the back.
They told me, 'Don't get on the stage with that hat on your head.'
They treated me badly!
And then they tell me I'm grounded," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West said, "Would you like to see the deep down?" saying, "I put my superintendent's hat on my head, because this shows that nobody can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were received at least twice by the spectators and members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reports, where a person told the newspaper: "All the studio fell silent."
West was called a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former lover, Reperio Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days ago.
The West surprised many with the interpretation of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: THE FLAMEMINDER YOU LIVED IN THE BALLA TURMS."
But the broadcast moderator Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West was just "self and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose MOS to reward someone (by buying music or clothes or by supporting his "art"), whom I believe is embarrassing and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
And he is free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer declared on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was already "the poem previously known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and also the late Prince music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accused of attempted stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Service.
'Game of Thrones' star, Kit Harington, good toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of the medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of male hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young boys realize they should act as strong to respect.
Speaking of 'The Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believed that 'something had gone wrong' and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his acting colleague in "Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he feels "very important" to solve the issue.
'I personally feel very important about this issue for the moment -- where have we made a mistake with the display of masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problems we are facing now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the excessive male characters displayed there.
And he continued, 'What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young boys believe they should behave in a certain way to feel like men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
'Cause obviously something went wrong with young boys.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer run for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying that "females and horses have come to the top of their nose".
As of November, Kit will participate in a ‘True West’ restoration by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother thief.
The actor last showed that meeting with his wife Rose is the best thing he got from "Game of Thrones".
'In this product I found my wife, so we can say that this show gave me my next family and set my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte's role, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastico-scientific winning series of 'Emmy' awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 in owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV through this way had almost gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT persons still prevails.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs because of inappropriate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical children to treat HIV as part of an attempt to hit this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data is being disseminated by staff members, says these are 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
US representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information to three US senators of the Republic on the lawmakers' websites in Wikipedia.
The democracies from Los Angeles claimed that these claims were being pushed by experts and online pages "of the right-wing extremism".
"False, lie and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information reported includes home address and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing session on sexual misconduct against the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative sites such as the Gateway Pounds and the RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of publications were linked to the Waters office and reported the data of a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member -- the identity, personal information and security of which has been compromised as a result of these false and sworn claims -- has not been in any way responsible for the flow of this information.
This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement immediately faced online criticism, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is becoming frustrated," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the right temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he shouldn't get nervous.
It shouldn't be provocative.
The accused's motives should not be challenged.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being extremely nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take Waters to elections in the middle of the term, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"The big turn, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office had signaled "related authorities and law enforcement institutions about these false charges.
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect on everyone from my staff."
Review of the film "Johnny English Hits Again" - comedy with unequipped spy Rowan Atkinson
It has been the case that in every new film with British influence, it is seen for hidden messages related to Brexit's theme, and this finds implementation and resumption at the comedy-action business "Johnny English" -- which has its beginnings in 2003 with "Johnny English" and with the return in 2011 with "Johnny English Retrieval".
Will this satirical comedy show how clearly unable we are to relate to new national export opportunities?
In any case, the person with eyes coming out of the country, with his face like a tire and apparently Johnny English, has received permission to confuse things for the second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a broad comic creature spread out to territories where English is not spoken, but who attends cinemas.
Of course, he is a maniac secret agent, who, despite strangely claiming to be a magician, has little of Inspector Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean's character, and a portion of that guy who contributed only to the release of a sound in the song 'Chariots of Fire', at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games.
It is also based on the man of mystery, traveler and international Atkinson, who once played on television advertisements that are now forgotten by 'Barclaycard', leaving the country in chaos wherever he walked.
There's one or two pleasant moments in this movie's premiere.
I liked it very much when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a middle parsley, and the helicopter’s coat was slightly wrapped in his helmet.
Here is the gift of the physical comedy performed by Atkinson, but humor seems like the vats and sometimes too much, especially when the 'serious' films like 007 and the Unmundated Mission have also introduced little comedies as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be addressing children more than adults and Johnny English's crisscrossing events are not so creative and are focused on silent movements, the same as what Atkinson does in Bean's character.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that Britain and the Great are in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has been infiltrated into the super-secret network of British agents, discovering the identity of British land agents and has depriving the agent of a role - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister who appears like a fireman and willing to fight, who is already suffering an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best to realize the character that Teresa May looks like, but there's not much text on the scene he can play.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy is compromised, she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level neighborhood, but who informally taught how to become a secret agent: here are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a school of spying in the form of a rock school.
English is again called to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and is reunited with his former assistant, multifaceted Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, connected to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-level girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has used a little mistake for this role.
So Batman and Robin's doing things completely back in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, fighting with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is enchanting by the attractive billionaire of technology who claims to be able to solve the difficulties of British computers -- the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ridiculous and demeaning hate: masked as cameramen, they set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; they cause chaos as they enter the luxury yacht of Volta; and English is completely confused as he tries to use the virtual reality equipment to get acquainted with the interior parts of Volta's house.
All the sequences are normally made for the final stage, but despite its fun and noisy, everything seems a little like a movie for kids.
Pretty moderate stuff.
As in the other movies Johnny English, I couldn't think of it: didn't the British film industry have a role for Rowan Atkinson to adapt to his talent?
The Laborist Party denies there is a plan for British workers to work four days a week but to be paid for five days
The Laborist Party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make British people work four days a week -- but pay for five.
The party is reported to want company leaders to save using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for workers, giving them an extra day of rest.
We would see that workers would enjoy a three - day vacation weekend — but would continue to take the same route home.
The sources said the idea would "be compatible" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country back in favour of the workers.
Spending a week with four days of work is an idea that is covered by the Trade Union Congress, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said 'The Sunday Times': 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen right away, but a four-day job is an aspirate that matches the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of workers and also the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Laburiste Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged for a week with four days' work during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, at present this aspirin is not supported by the whole Laborist Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not taken into account by the party.'
The office in Hye, John McDonnell, used the last week's Labour Party conference to push his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass power from 'anonymous directors' and 'profiters' to public service firms.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not take all their shares back, because the Laborist government can carry out 'defence' with the justification of the actions considered to be violations.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create the All-Inclusive Property Funds to pass 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms, which means a paid-in dividend of up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, showed in "60 Minutes," if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least one week, and raises questions as to whether findings from the investigation bureau may affect any republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent for the "60 Minutes" issue, Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina college.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was going to the hearing room, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got it on the phone after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, "Did you do this?
He was determined and clear."
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been thrown into the rock.
"I have divided my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Festival "Global Citizen" and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the "Global Citizen" Festival, an annual music show that contains a large and impressive list of stars that interpret and also have a mission that is so impressive; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the "Global Citizen" Festival will wait for thousands of people in the "Great Lawn" Central Park who not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Minds' interpretations, but also become aware of the true purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international legal group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to benefit from a free presentation ticket (except in case you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must perform a set of duties, or "actions" as a voluntary job, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when it has been 12 years to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of people's reward work with a free concert a real way to convince those who seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "clicking activism" -- people who feel they're making a real change by signing an online petition or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" has been said to have registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving them a push for different purposes.
It is said that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare $37 billion worth of political and political commitment, which is said to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 pledges and declarations as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimated that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main promises include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementing agencies based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children grow up with their full potential," promising them to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the disaster in this country, after receiving more than 4700 "citizens" from the "Global Citizens" activists.
"With support from the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of abuse into a memory of the past," The Power of Nutrition ambassador to a concert in London in April 2018 told the crowd.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for children's mothers, the government declared financing a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most common questions on their website where they ask, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as with every higher right of the city, and as with the moving of the apartment before us, we shall go out, for we are together stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors who will play this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy for "blocks" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may rely on his Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria -- particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the Syrian legitimate government -- is a pretext to explore for new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there are ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, to block them, so as to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization that has personalized itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He continued comparing Washington's approaches to treatment with Iran's Russia, pointing out that these approaches are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuel," he said, as he referred to Russia as "a deceitful butter" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump themselves, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 host, which according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow "robot".
Moscow has consistently said that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 gazellor, which is supposed to double the existing gazellor's capacity to bring it to 110 billion cubic feet, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the hot opposition of the project from Washington is only made for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has been opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation for industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a meeting of a few years ago between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously think" if he will run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" participating in the race for president after the elections in the middle of the term.
During a gathering in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and regulate our corrupt government, and this involves setting a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take seriously the candidate for president."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a gathering in the city, saying he "is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a poll Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before we vote."
However, a poll issued Thursday showed that much of Warren's voters themselves do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts's "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty - two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for the candidates, where 38 percent supported his possible candidacy and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high profile democracies that have been discussed to race in 2020 include former President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Budden said he would officially decide in January, the 'Associated Press' reported.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being summoned to the army in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"What my son is going through, what he is experiencing after he has returned, can connect him with other families that feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told participants at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans, "come a little changed, hardened, come to think if they get the proper respect of the soldiers and other members of the army, for what they have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman, after a report of domestic violence and armed robbery while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbian District are supporting a legal opposition to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who have saved criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the county deposited an explanatory document as a court-martial in Washington on Friday, in support of changing asylum-seeker policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Session issue that the US Civil Liberties Union has deposited in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but US officials denied her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a high number of asylum seekers in the United States, because they are states that have problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeker policy returned a 2014 decision from the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to save domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney General, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores all decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require all asylum requirements to be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure is in conflict with this principle," the court-martial report stated.
The lawyers further argued in the report that the ban on the entry of migrants was damaging the American economy, saying their skills are to become entrepreneurs and "furnish the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop giving asylum to victims who save domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assisi is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief," the session was said on June 11th, on the day of the political declaration.
Asylum has never been meant to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to save Paul while the balance of death is doubled in a race to survive
To the survivors, the situation was very honorable.
"The situation is quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while keeping her little and sick son in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palus.
"The ambulance brings troops every minute.
There's no clean water anymore."
The inhabitants saw themselves returning to their ruined houses, putting their goods into the water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the 7.5 - foot - long [7.5 m] earthquake damaged hospitals are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were placed at the Military Hospital outside Palus, where patients are being treated in the external environment because of the earth’s earthquakes still continuing.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed under the ruins of the wall," Harris said 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman was crying and asking for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'gacacm' with 'propagandistic advertising'
A week after China's official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on an American daily, where the shared benefits of US-China trade were propagated, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the “China Daily” supplement at the “Des Moines Register” -- the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa -- after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections held on 6 November, an indictment rejected by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what American officials told Reuters as a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to add pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to set up advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen tariffs on imports from one another.
Chinese and American experts have said China's payroll rates in this trade war were set to hit exporters in states like Ioua, who supported the Republican Trump party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor for a long time in Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the 'Des Moines Register' on Sunday, Branstad wrote, "China is already doubling this scourge by placing propaganda advertising on our free press."
"As it spreads its propaganda, the Chinese government is helping by the happy American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a pay advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast to this, in the streets of newspapers here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any real reflection of the different thoughts the Chinese may have of China's worrying economic trajectory, since the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, avoided the offer to publish his article," even though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are switching women ahead of elections in the middle of a post-Kavanaugh scandal mandate
The more major characters of Republicans to solidarity and defend the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in front of some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they would face a severe reaction especially from women in the next elections in the middle of the mandate.
Emotions about this topic have been very high, and many republics have publicly declared that they want to continue voting on the candidate.
These things can't go away," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Syracuse University 'Scholla Maxwell told 'The Hill' about a published article on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute's attempt to investigate an FBI investigation and that this would be enough to calm angry voters.
"The cities won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokesperson for the Progressive Group 'MoveOn', according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang 'Nentor is coming!' as they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors while Republicans under the control of the Judicial Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported 'Mic'.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach the Mayans," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, said to the news page.
"People are saying it's already been at high levels; that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among unestablished voters of women on the outskirts and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on the High Court candidate, analysts suggested that there would be a severe reaction if Republicans continued to support this candidacy.
"This has turned into a collapse for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to 'NBC News'.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be found or not in the accused's bank, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this issue and how they have dealt with that woman," NBC News, Guy Cecil, Director of Priority USA, said a group that helps choose Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by ‘YouGov’ shows that 41 per cent of respondents certainly believe in Ford's testimony, or most likely, while 35 per cent say they believe in doubt or most likely Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent believe that Kavanaugh, likely or doubtless, has lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the claims submitted by Ford and the other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports 'The Guardian'.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court showed his genital organs before her while they were at a party during the time they studied in Yale, in the 1980s.
World Wide Network Creator plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Network, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, 'Inrupt', is a company built by Berners-Lee's open-source platform called 'Solid'.
‘Solid’ allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals are allowed to have access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for 'Fast Company,' Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind 'Inrupt' is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create "maintain their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of things to do, musical lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as being available on a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique for storing personal data on the network is the fact that it remains completely in the user’s hands about what kind of information it will access.
The company calls this "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company executive director John Bruce, is to bring together the resources, processes and skills needed to help Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on this project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google if they should present or not a total change where all their business models are completely flooded during the night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post published in the 'Media' on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's insolvency debate.
While Inrupt is founded, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Victorian Cross during World War I for the clergy
The only clergyman who won a Victorian Crusade during World War I in the war’s quality is remembered at his birth, 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack in Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never realized that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandkids, Michael Vann, said it was "exactly symbolic" that the memorial was displayed exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to 'London Gazette', on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the brunt of bullets from fields and mitralos."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great trim" turned the battalion forward and seized one of the weapons in the field and killed only three of the opposing troops.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were appointed by a post-paradise crown headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said that "he felt quite honored that he was part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is being shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans stayed all night awake to follow Bellator 206, but instead they saw "Derrkucizen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been up all night to see Bellator 206, and then you're taking the opportunity to see this major event.
The San Jose show contained 13 fights, including six fights in the base package and would be displayed in real time during the night on channel 5, at the MB.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were amazed when the transmission changed to show Derkucec Pepa.
Some were unhappy because they had been awake all night until the first hours of the night, especially for this game.
A fan on Twitter described this transition from the game to a visual film for children as "a bad joke."
"It's government rules that determine that at 6am that content was not suitable for and we should move to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of marketing and communication in Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa's deer."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on the programming to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, so Monday with their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed there were many messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to do the show with five matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're trying to give them more for fans, and maybe we're going to go over the schedule.
It's a miserable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
The Olympicist, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality -- but that gave him motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to school for nine years that "not all were like me."
Speaking of the first programme on Radio 4 of ‘Desert Island Discs,’ presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he raised the voice for homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less of winning Olympic medals.
The permanent chairman of the long program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to rest because of her illness.
Showing up as a remote person in Laverne's first program, Daley said that as he grew up he felt "low" towards others because "he was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, were the real elements that gave me the motivation and strength to cope."
He wanted to prove that he was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze Olympic medal is already a high profile LGBT activist with high profile and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said it was open because he felt lucky that he was able to live open and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The world's champion said three times that falling in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has caught me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar prize winner, who is 20 years older than he was, but said the difference in age has never been a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such a young age," he went to the first Olympic at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age that he had experienced the same low-up.
The couple became parents in June, of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all perspectives" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was 'I should win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if we were ready for London 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell 'that you couldn't be in the first row," he said.
"I was holding my hand while he took breath and only after the rest took breath and changed his life for the first time I accepted it and he was not infallible," he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to sneak in front of the local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection -- Proud by Heather Small -- which has accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause the morica.
Desert Island Discs is delivered to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British time.
Mickelson, out of shape, was left at the table on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Miquelon will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form so as not to return this historic moment to disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time that participates in this event, a more self-organized record, was left at the table by Captain Jim Fury during both fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of major titles five times spent the day supporting the team and working with hope to leave behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the fairest hit even when he was at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated Le Golf National field, where long and difficult fields leave no room for wrong shooting.
And if it wasn't enough for fear of the field, Mikkelson, on Sunday, in the ninth match, will face the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with the beginning of Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four fewer points before the start of the 12 train matches, are going to get a rough start, the Mikkelson game can be decisive.
Fury expressed faith in his player, although he could not say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a stabbing, put his hand on my neck and told me he'd be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself.
He's in the Famous Hall and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I had thought more, but eventually it turned out that way and that was how we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more performances at Ryder Cup matches.
He can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, where he wasn't at the height of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equations, although Fury said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to harass people, and he's a great guy to have him in the team room," he explained.
"So far, I think the younger players were having fun dealing with her during this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than just a game."
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that the considerable leadership ahead of the last day of the tech games at Ryder Cup can be turned into an unpleasant factor.
Danez made his debut in front of 1997 in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Sev Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans closed the tournament by winning a very narrow difference, 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"It reminds itself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after having won 5-3 in 'Class 2018' on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in 'Le Golf National'.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll go with the last march.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this trophy, and here's our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we have -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this phase.
Tomorrow we're going to face another "breathing".
Tomorrow the individual performances are highlighted, and this is something else to be done.
It's great when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you try your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you have to follow to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner as he should go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players perform better individually than with partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, have received three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced two cases of major returns of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brussels before losing what is considered the "Wonderful in Medina" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day of Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as we saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take a turn on one side, you put a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We've put the formation based on this and we're going to get the boys out of the ranking we believe is better, since you know, we're trying to realize a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the duty to launch the collapse of the result and will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players standing in the first half of the ranking
"I chose this group and in this order I believe it covers all the road in the match," Bjorn said about his tech choices.
The production of the new German war is delayed again
The new German Navy fleet should have been sent in 2014 to replace cold-time battles, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and rather high costs, local media have reported.
The "Reinland-Pfalz" shipment, the main ship of new ‘Baden-Wuerttemberg-class’ freight, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper ‘Die Zeit’ quoted by a military spokesman.
The ship had to join Marina in 2014, but the problems after the shipment damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ‘Baden-Wuerttemberg-class’ ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as replacements for the old ‘Bremen-class’ brakes.
As it is known, it will contain a powerful ball, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and counter-ships and detection technology (steel), such as reducing detection from radar, red infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it must be possible for new freight to be moved for more than two years away from the country’s ports.
However, ongoing delays mean that the fights of the latest technology -- which are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad -- will be obsolete at the time they enter service, writes 'Die Zeit'.
F125, Fragata appeared on the first page last year, when the German Navy officially refused to order this ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss seayard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Marina returned a ship to her builder after delivery.
A little information was given about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany quoted as being a set of "big software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The programme's problems were particularly important in Baden-Württemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a team of 120 sailors -- half the working power of the old 'Bremen class' freight.
It was also discovered that the ship was too overweight, which reduced its performance and limited Marina’s ability to add improvements to the future.
"Reinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be twice the weight of ships of a similar category used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the cost of the whole project -- including team training -- is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached a figure that leaves you with no words of €3.1 billion (€3.6 billion) -- of €2.2 billion that was initially projected.
The problems that have gripped the new freight becomes particularly important after recent warnings that the power of the German navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee in the German parliament, admitted that Marina is "enduring suitable ships to move to another country."
The official said that the problem had been added over time because the old ships had been pulled out of use but were not replaced with new ones.
He said with regret that none of Baden-Württemberg-class's new brakes could join the Navy.
The National Trust Observes the Secret Life of Night’s Blinds
A new research being carried out by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland is aimed at discovering how night skylights use land to shoot for food.
It is hoped that new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying creatures and will help protect activities in the future.
A study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night larchs and those called soprano pipistrelles as well as the coffee-longs and Daubenton larchs in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track nighttime lactating activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
An analysis of the sounds that experts will perform for all recordings will determine the frequency of the night’s noises and what each species does.
Then a report and a map of their habitat will be prepared to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are most important to nightlights and how they are used by each species.
This information would help to determine the good of the administration of the settlements, such as the creation of pastures and how the trees for nightfalls and other related species are cared for.
The number of nightmares in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last century.
They are under threat of building and developmental work that has an impact on housing and housing.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as do the attaching letters or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
Indeed, the darknesses of night are not blind.
However, because of their habit of fishing during the night, their ears are more beneficial than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use sophisticated location detection techniques through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taken very seriously with nightlights.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, speech inspections and sometimes involve them in rescue programs.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to night hares, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as a home for eight out of ten species of night hares in Scotland.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says this country is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have an excellent area for night-lights," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
But there are still many things about the dark night that remain unknown to the work we do here and in other countries that will help us understand more than they need to 'development'."
He stresses the importance of carrying out checks on the night before the works of property maintenance because there is a possibility that the imminent destruction of a folley may kill up to 400 women and young people at night, thus destroying the entire population of an area.
The nightmares of the night are protected and killing, their harassment and concern, or the destruction of their speech is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee near the Trust for the Conservation of Night’s Lakes, encourages people to become part of the relief effort.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our nightmares at night and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers prepare to indict the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said charges of rape against him are "false news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to indict the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375 000 so he wouldn't talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram, addressed to 142 million of his followers, just hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," the Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to charge 'Der Spiegel' with these charges, which they have called "unacceptable reports of suspicions about private life,"
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "the moral damage to the value corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented at the Clark Circuit Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him in anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" left in the mud by "one per cent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had committed sexual intercourse but that it was with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement outside the court because she was "barred by revenge" and that she was concerned that she would "suffer publicly."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to repay the agreement because it continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he passed to the Italian youth giants in a 100m-euro deal.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever repent" for losing the status of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will "repent forever" if it loses world leadership status in the production of cars after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily ban production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in the event of an unagreed exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my judgment, if Britain comes from the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the administrative director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the MB, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement and of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit would close its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to the fact that car manufacturers are referred to as the risk of the supply chain in the case of a non-contractual Brexit.
Toyota's production line works on the basis "as soon as ordered," with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the US and the EU, for ordering cars.
If, on March 29th, MB comes out of the EU without an agreement, there may be delays to which this industry may lead to delays and missing parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory at her factory in Derbyshire more than one day, the company said, and to produce it would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's 'Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU "has been built specifically to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment so that we can also take advantage of this opportunity," he said for the program Today on BBC Radio 4.
"Data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, show that we certainly need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long the production would stop, but in the long term, warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and consequently lead to reduced jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior official of the United Nations trade union in the factory, said members are becoming more and more concerned: "According to my experience when these countries close, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set a close and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy General Procurator Rod Rosenstein can be "extended for a week" after the fight continues for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interventions, the links between Trump and Russia's assistant staff and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
The debate whether Trump will disband or not the deputy attorney-general from duty, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, is something that has been created for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times, reported that Rosenstein took into consideration the appointment of an listener to record talks with Trump and the possibility of downloading the president through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied that news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among reports that he was close to giving up.
Unlike what I expected, a meeting with Trump, which was held in the United Nations headquarters in New York on Thursday, was announced.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to disband Rosenstein, but then the meeting was pushed to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of immoral sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI for claims against Kavanaugh, further pushing the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet a date, it could be this week, and I think it could take another week, considering everything else that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question of why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not result from the dissatisfaction with the attitude of TV journalists," she said, even though she said: "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
Later, it became clear that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president conducts more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting the data: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to question directly the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often over the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or in a press conference with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have explained the reason for this fact, during this week, in New York, where he made a controversial statement and in some strange cases in front of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU employees, in NHS Scotland, about fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written the EU staff working in NHS in Scotland to express gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, members of the Scottish parliament, has sent a letter, when they have remained less than six months from MB's EU withdrawal.
The Scottish government has already taken over to cover application costs for the status of permanent resident for EU citizens working in local public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations on removing the EU from the EU have continued, drawing closer to making a decision in autumn.
But the MB government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an unagreed scenario.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the health service work, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay here very much."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' midwife Christian Abercrombie was subjected to an immediate surgical intervention following head injury on Saturday, in the loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennesseen journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State Rod Reed's coach told reporters that the damage happened just before the first part.
"He came to the sideline and fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it in the bar and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital Centre.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first Tennessee State season after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, leading him to 18 total interventions during the season.
Foreign buyers will pay the highest bill when they buy a property in MB
Foreign buyers will pay the highest bill fee for buying a property in the MB and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new Conservative Party (Tory) plans
This move will neutralize Corby's initiative's success to attract new voters
Pulsary tax will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in MB
Treasury Department anticipates gathering up to GBP 120m a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay higher bill fees for buying a property in the MB and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an effort to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's initiative to attract new voters with promises to offer more affordable shelter and to "seek" high-income people.
The ticket tax will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the MB, while additional money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of shelter.
This extra rate -- which is added to the current ticket tax, including the increase in the tattoo scale presented two years ago for the second houses and for the property purchased to rent -- can go up to three per cent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this move will accumulate up to GBP 120m a year.
About 13 per cent of the recently built property in London is purchased by residents outside the US, which causes price increases and makes it more difficult to find accommodation from buyers for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country -- especially in capitals -- have become "phantasm cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the ticket tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of keeping high prices by buying land but not putting into use, and called on Mrs. May to give up the quota for facing houses, in order to regulate the "british turf with property."
Mr. Corby has proposed some attractive reforms for shelter, including the control of rentals and the removal of "unreasonable" removals.
He also wants to give more power to counsel on building new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate my mandate to the prime minister of the return of the British dream -- that is, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means we fix the problem of the home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the MB and foreign societies to buy homes more easily than British workers.
For many people, a dream to own a house has become something too difficult to achieve, and injustice to homeless people is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland Coach Jack Ross says "his greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
Scottish, 42, is enjoying the challenge of raising the north-east club, which is currently located in the third place in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He arrived this summer at the Trinity Stadium after returning St. Mirren to Prime Minister the Scottish League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I appeared once in representative B and only so," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always drawn me.
However, this option will only come if I am successful in the direction of clubs."
Ross' ancestors in Sunderland's direction include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says she is not concerned that she is following the steps of these great names in such a big club since she has previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'can I return this team to Prime Minister League?'
Given the structure and environment of this club, there is no doubt that the country has the place in Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not easy to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I could get the club back to Prime Minister League."
Ross has only started his career as a coach after a period as a assistant coach in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months at Hearts' management staff.
He later helped Alloa to raise a category up to the third round of the Cup, and transformed St. Mirren from a club near the fall from the category in the championship title winners next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, for taking Alloa's direction.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I was playing well, I was living a good life because of this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Since then, I have experienced much stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to train and now I've been doing something like this.

According to one study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat waves have increased local income in difficult situations in Britain, but pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Data show that sales in the local groups and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July — but shopping in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant in the CGA, who collected the data, said: "The constant solar climate as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected influenced July to follow the same trend as winter, where local sales increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants recorded even higher declines.
The tour of restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and it worsened even further in July.
Bars and venues with main activity offering drinks recorded the best performance, with higher growth than reducing trade in restaurants.
The main activities of the food supply also recognized the decline as a result of the sun’s weather, although not as significant as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in bars and locals increased by 6.6 per cent that month, while food dropped by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst on free time and hospitality in RSM said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the retail market, the weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a fall in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will have a particularly heavy burden considering continuous cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators, and time will show if the average temperatures of August give the most desired calm."
The total increase in sales at the premises and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of brands.
The Coffer Peach Index for Industrial Sales, for the bar and restaurant sector in the MB, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, and is the industrial reference point.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
According to one study, one in five children — some of whom are not more than 11 years old — have secret accounts in social media that hide their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 educational students nine years of age showed an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear of sexual content posts
Twenty per cent of students said they have a "core" account that shows parents
One in five children — some of whom are not more than 11 years old — are opening social media accounts, which are used secretly by adults.
A survey of 20,000 educational students nine years of age showed rapid increases in Insta's "false" profiles -- related to the photo distribution page, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of sexual content posts.
Twenty per cent of students said they use a clean "core" account that they show their parents, but also have a private account.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, discovered that a teenager encouraged others to "violently."
The study of the UK Digital Awareness and the "Headmasters and Headmistresses" Conference of Independent Schools revealed that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the sound of athletes" on the board of Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle has been elected on the board of the Athletics in Scotland, at the non-executive director's post of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of pistes and fields and President Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the MB and in the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit extremely much by making that part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am excited that I will serve as the voice of athletes and I hope I will contribute and help towards sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre race in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four total Olympic gold medals and who is a regular expert at BBC, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemic strike.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
He couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell him if I was going to be healed and to what extent.
It took hard work, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing forced labor!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertising of breast pump that compares mothers to cows shares public opinion
A company for the production of breast pumps has divided public opinion with an advertising that compares mothers to cows.
To begin the promotion of what is considered "the first pump of the world without noise and which can be worn," the company of consumer technology products Elvie showed a gastronomic music video to advertise the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four true mothers dance in a cow stable filled with grass under the sounds of a song with text as follows: "Yes, I honey myself, but I can't" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't the way, it's my chest."
Refreni continues: "Bombs, pumps, feeding babies, pumps, pumps, milking ladies."
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the Facebook page, has caused online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly reactions from the viewers, with many of them expressing that it underestimates the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Like us they should remain "six" and "born" to produce milk, only their "babes" are taken from them a few days after they were born," someone wrote.
The Elvie rope pump is placed inside the recipes and is not visible (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Districtly traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't we use you to advertise a giraffe pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "What advertisements insensitive."
Others supported the ad, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "for fun."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if you were still feeding the kid.
The pump made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I saw what it means.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a gas advertising addressed to mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and who feel like "the cow."
This is not an advertisement that evaluates or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have all danced with the "hidden" pump placed in the recipe.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is soundless, has no wire or pipe, is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into sight, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out while they use it.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD (Creative Executive Director) in Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and milk cows, we wanted to highlight the use of the breast pump and the challenges they face, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that gives the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pump comes out on the first page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared in the stylist Marta Jakuwski’s parlour using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been displaced in silence in a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of banned migrant children has increased even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively the same, partly as a result of rhetoric and rigid policies presented by the Trump administration, which have made it difficult to send children to their supporter.
Usually, most supporters have even been documentless migrants themselves, and have been afraid to risk their position in the country by making sure to apply for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these data would also pass on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support the unaccompanied bribery.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no previous criminal precedent.
"Approximately 80 per cent of individuals who are supporters or members of the family of supporters remain in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedent.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter workers, realizing that children’s data was processed more quickly, officials introduced new rules that some of them sought to appear in court within a month of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the emigration judge through videoconferencing, not physically, to argue their request for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, as long as children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say that these concerns are more pronounced in larger environments such as Tornillo, where, because of their size, signs of child’s difficulties are more likely to escalate.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends may cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria seeks US, French and Turkish "captures" to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces are staying in Syrian land illegally, with the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the right way."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moulem insisted that "the fight against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both by terrorist groups and by "foreign foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this country separated from the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that makes refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that must be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major fortress of rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had "clear guidelines" and expressed confidence that the military attacks would target the jihadists, including combatants from the Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for government participation in this committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "in revising the mothers of the current constitution," and warned that there was no intervention.
Why Trump will win a second mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 except when, as many people with liberal views hope, accusations and scandals end his presidency early.
In what would certainly be "the most dramatic foundation of a presidency in history!"
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and has been nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewer of 2.4 million during the peak hour, of 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" programme has reached the top of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evenings with major events.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the drama series at ABC "Designated Survival," who tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
It recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovel said to me.
There are entertaining values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade if immigrant families can unite and health of the global economy.
Respect is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can face.
However, if you find yourself after six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of "peaceful information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's leather bomber jacket, worth $15,000 ("a dress filled with arrogance," The Washington Post) as well as the implications of Stormy Daniels' live descriptions for Mr. Trump's anatomy, then it goes beyond being an informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"A part of what he does and that makes it seem like a 'reality show' is that you are fed with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars, about the actors that are circulating and the unexpected daily developments of the Trump programme (debate with N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong).
You can't leave an episode out of sight unless you stay back.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, looking at MSNBC, while registering CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the High Court, which depended on the fine.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programs in the past and people who said, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

The money from outside the private sector is placed in the tight competition for Congress elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania area 17 is facing a cash flow, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral zones, which forces two officials to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganisation in Pittsburgh's peripheral areas has set up Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his post in another area, in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12-year-old area of Pennsylvania, whose new 17th zone has been over-established.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which, in January, stated that the old areas were designated in an unconstitutional and unfair manner in favour of the Republicans.
This race, in the new zone 17, has also sparked a strong confrontation in funding campaigns from key party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the special elections widely held in March for the 18th election area of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, that post was held by the Republicans and President Donald Trump won this area 20 different points.
Political experts see democrats as easy favorites.
The US takes into account to penalise El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organisation's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decisions not to know Taiwan," Department spokesman Heather Naurut said during a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only discussed with El Salvador who received some 140m US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and specific restrictions on visas, would be severe for the Central American country and its high levels of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to attend a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid - September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, ending any opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to hold a talk at the conference, which has been predicted in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats expressed.
And the three American envoys returned peacefully from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions, provided that their anonymity was preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right of anonymity.
Study history
The next event that is expected to happen may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller for possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in the public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is moving his investigation to verify whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has co-operated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its arm, Mr. Trump will have to account before this body, at a time when it is prepared to go out again before voters, and perhaps face an independent jury.
This is a lot if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall or that of his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to strike the state against Hitler, if the West would have resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The outcome of history depends on these turning points, which speed up or delay the unstoppable course of democracy.
At present, Americans face some of these turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump disbanded Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation against Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation ever since this newspaper reported, during the past year, that he had suggested he would listen secretly to the president, and had speculated that he was not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times article is not correct.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed in the High Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the next elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that conquered the ambassadors ’ residence where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light up the Sabbath candles on that table that bears the symbol of the swastika (broken cross).
Having this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger player Graham Dorans is optimistic in the face of Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers await Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory in front of the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain in front of Villareal, earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify as Group G of the League of Europe.
A sleep damage did not allow poorer Graham Dorrans to make the first presentation this season at 2-2 against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a incentive to achieve greater things.
"It was an important point for us because Villareal is a good team," 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field believing that we could take something and we got out with a point.
Perhaps we could have noted at the end, but, in general, I believe that equality was a good result.
Maybe they were better at the first while we showed up at the second and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they achieved a positive result in their previous match, but with the fans who support us, I'm sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to injuries and changes in the club, but now there is an optimistic factor in this team.
The team is good, and the boys are enjoying this very much; training is good.
I hope we can move forward, throw the past season behind our arms and succeed."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of pension savings
Even though the study participants had a clear idea of how we would like family members to show care for them, very few people talked to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about long - term care costs.
Only 10 percent answered that they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the Society's deputy president for life insurance, Nationwide.
Here's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you first show your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can benefit from being careful, since these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Also take your financial advisor: The consultant can help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care funding options include a traditional long-term care security police, hybrid life-saving security police to help cover these expenses or self-security through your wealth -- for as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through authorization.
Take a health care search and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also consider getting a lawyer for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee payment of bills if you cannot do such a thing yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and medications you're taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you can be ready.
"Not only is the financial aspect at stake, but also who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What medications will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person is shot several times by air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with a gun in the air as he goes home after spending the night outside.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Police officers said this was a "random act", which occurred around 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries received do not pose a risk to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Thunderstorms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and the tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials have declared while the number of dead is expected to increase.
With out-of-function communication networks, assistance workers have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, a zone north of Palau, which was closer to the 7.5-foot earthquake epicenter.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below are some facts about Paul and Dongala on the island of Sulawes:
Palo is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow slope on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379 800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regent that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast line to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and cod are the province's main economic activities, especially in the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowola, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Disaster Reduction Agency in Indonesia, Paul and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunami during the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami took over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Dongala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the Shismic Zone of the Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 casualties along the Indian Ocean Coast line, more than half of which lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-front earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-front earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - foot - high earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 feet (10 m) high that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A Czech earthquake hit the Pide Jaya Regency in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after recalling the destruction caused by the earthquake and the deadly tsunami in 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives from the collapse of buildings.

The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Paulin's older son is arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested with the charge of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by the Alaskan state police, Pauline, 29 years old, by Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspected of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he received the phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention booth and is being held a guarantee in the form of unsecured $500 bonds, KTUU reported.
According to reports from this network, he was brought before the court on Saturday and when asked about the admission of guilt, he declared "it is absolutely innocent".
Palin faces three violations of category A, which means he can be jailed up to a year and sentenced to $250,000.
He is also accused of a category B violation, which is sentenced to one day in prison and $2000 in prison.
It's not the first time criminal charges against Paul have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This case is currently being considered by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reporting of domestic violence, and maintaining drunk weapons during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had hit him with his fist on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans' groups after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of the service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have lost their lives on Friday, as a result of an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5 - foot - high earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of service, and the number of dead is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake hit the central part of Sulawesi, located northeastern Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack at NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, is supposed to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a road for bicycles along the western highway, in lower Manhattan, crossing pedestrians and bicycles.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must verify that Saipov has killed eight victims "with suspicion" and has caused serious bodily "with suspicion" injuries, according to a letter aimed at seeking the death penalty imposed in the South of New York.
According to a court document, both of these charges may be punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury put Saipov in front of 22 charges, including eight charges for murdering organised crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has come as a result of "a considerable and predictable planning," prosecutors said, describing the way in which Saipov's crime was executed as "disgusting, cruel and morally unscrupulous."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," writes the purpose letter.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the New York South District was criminally pursuing a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually was sentenced to eternal prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were sentenced to conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both of them were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, with a Uzbek nation, did not show any penance during the days and months following the attack.
He has declared before the investigators that he feels good about what he has done, the police reported.
According to activism, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing no video of ISIS in his cell phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has declared himself innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty and not accept guilt associated with eternal imprisonment without appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events among all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed at the top of Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today, during a protest at the Conservatives' conference, that he would 'mobilize the army of the people'.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the "pressure" of the Eurosceptic -- after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Deputy Conservative Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the MB 'would be out' if Brexit's secretary was Mr. Farage.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to join her group has been highlighted by the conservatives for the EU position, who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached in Chequers, among the attacks that come from those who want to stand or withdraw from the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of severe reactions -- and will force Eurosceptics and labians to choose between its package and chaos."
During the march, Largim means Largim, Mr. Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be taken over and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were at the top, now we'd be out,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers agreement.'
Expressing his stand against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be subject.
We want to draw up our laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone has rejected the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also in March and said to reporters: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, neither is it supported within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel pressure" if they were thinking of abandoning the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter of faith between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexie and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you do anything like that.'
During a enthusiastic message to the crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is near Brexit's abandonment, to feel pressure.
'We are mobilizing the army of this country's people who gave us the victory in Brexit and will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-government.'
Meanwhile, those pro stays marched to Birmingham before holding a two - hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists held billboards where Conservatives were written against Brexit, after the show of this group in the weekend.
Labourers' supporter Lord Adonis ironized the conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application" during the conference's launch.
'These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the IT systems and the technology needed for Canada plus plus, for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,' he added.
'It's totally a farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to "consider carefully" the possibility of running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has said he will "consider carefully the possibility of candidacy for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke of her future during a meeting in the municipality held on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, an ongoing critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the centre of speculation that it could run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in municipal format, from the time Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked if he had planned to run for the president.
Warren answered that the time has come for "females to go to Washington and settle the corrupt government, and that includes the setting of a woman at the top."
A person is arrested for murdering the LSU team player, Wayde Sims
Police at Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday that he arrested a suspect for killing the Wayne Sims basketball player on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested about 11 o'clock in the morning, the police department at Baton Rouge announced, through a media conference.
The police had published a video of the shootings on Friday, where they were looking for help to identify the person who was showing up there.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot with firearms and killed near the campus of South University during Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims changed his life as a result of gun wounds caused by fire in his head," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayne intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, holding a gun, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to prison in the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
Sims, 6'6' long, played 32 matches, of which 10 as title last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls in the game table.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team's instructions give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Walter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the leadership of the Mercedes team" would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas left the country first and almost "punished" Hamilton after protecting his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his team's friend.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to compete in "traffic" at the end of the car group, something that should have proved decisive.
Mercedes stopped a spin later and was positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after several maneuvers that forced Ferrari pilot to leave space behind a double movement to protect himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first round was the seventh, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He was then in the lead in a large part of the race after he did not change his tires to achieve a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen by ranking the fourth.
He eventually stopped in the 44th round but failed to improve the pace in the eight remaining rounds by releasing the fourth country to Raikkonen.
It is a difficult day because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was shown a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these positioning exchanges," Hamilton said.
Very Low Use of Body Language
President Donald Trump ironied Senator Diane Feinstein during a gathering on Saturday, in connection with her insistence, that it was not the person who "posted out" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "lawful, evil and unjust."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, bad, bad and unscrupulous," he said.
"When you look at the published secret publications and then people say, "oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the ones who put the paper out?
You remember her answer... did you extract the document -- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't take it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't take it out... No, we didn't take it out," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent letters with details of charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and the document came out earlier in September — but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't put her story on the market," Feinstein told the commission, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as she asked."
But it seems her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during the debate last Saturday night: "For my opinion, the guests really left to wish.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen the weakest findings before."
Taking into account the candidate for the High Court, who has been accused of three women for immoral sexual conduct, the president said the Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their aims.
"They are determined to regain power at all times.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break to gain power and control," the media reported as a saying by the president.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer marks twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated the lost loss against Belfast Giants on Friday, in the valuable challenge for the Elite League, winning the 5-3 return match Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants quickly took advantage of twice the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equated the results for the local team before Dwyer returned the Giants in favour.
Francois Bouchard evened for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen's two goals ensured his victory.
This was the third loss of the season, in the Elite League, for the faithful Adam Keefe, who came back on Friday evening from the disadvantage, to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth match between these teams, this season, with the first three wins by Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, by a Kendall McFaul assistant, while David Rutherford gave the Beauviller assistant, who doubled the result, four minutes later.
During a first intensive part, Sullivan returned to the locals at 13:10 before Matt Markwardt attended Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer was assured that Giants would take advantage of the break by marking his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first part.
The settlements were regrouped and Bouchard restored the equation with a strong blow at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined between them by assisting Nielsen, who gave Dundee the first advantage in this challenge, at the end of the second part, and secured his team's win with the fifth goal, marked in the last part.
Giants, who lost four out of five last meetings on Friday, will play the next match at home against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller lost his life by making sure hundreds of people on an airplane escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller, in Indonesia, is honored as a hero after losing his life by making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people is safely seated.
Over 800 people lost their lives, and many others have been declared lost after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawes on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area, and many have been trapped in tombs in the city of Paul.
But despite his colleagues running away to save him, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agg refused to leave his post on the tower of control that slipped violently at the Palus airport "Mutiara Sis Al Jufre Airport".
He stood to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight plane, which was on the runway at that time, could start safely.
Then he was thrown out of the traffic control tower when he thought she was falling.
He lost his life in the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Johannes Sirat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived at Paul.
"This news breaks our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands, while the local agency for the mitigation of the consequences of disasters says that entry into the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to rise, as there are still many bodies under the graves, while others have not been found," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The dams that reached up to six feet [6 m] have destroyed Paul, where a massive mortuary ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial aircraft are supplying supplies and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about "Sky News": "Every minute the ambulance brings troops.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets have been stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross is accelerating to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived on Sunday in Palo and addressed the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out any evacuation duties.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
Micronesian plane crash: "Air Niugini" now says a person has lost after a plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline that operated an airplane that crashed into the Pacific Bay in Micronesia now declared a lost person, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crews were safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking into the water.
In a press statement, Air Niugin said Saturday afternoon they are not finding a passenger.
The airline was said to be collaborating with local, hospital, and investigator authorities in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local ships helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable position.
The cause of the conflict and the consequences of the events themselves remain unclear.
Airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the pond after not reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"This is an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the level of the bee, he and others managed to get out of the plane’s emergency.
He said that the students were panicking and shouting, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors working on the repair of a skeleton nearby helped to save them, using an airship to transport people on the shore before the plane sinks to about 30 meters (100 feet) under the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in collisions with the lines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but "Air Niugin" was not involved in any of them.
Analyst builds night chronology when a woman dies alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented her arguments in a person's retrial, who is accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
American Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours, as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone data to rebuild the defendant's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that this last changed his life.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he has received location data from some cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, the fact that rejects his previous claims.
When the data found that his cell phone was in the same place as that of Chambers during the time he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford was brought before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was in Sanford's truck that night, the last one said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction is Tellis's statement, which said she knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they had only one week that they knew each other.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He hid him from his life," said Hale.
The defenseless is expected to give cover-up arguments on Sunday.
The judge declared that the jury would take the decision that day.

Another man with a color?
Grandfather from New York accused the couple of getting away from work after receiving the "racist" message
A New York Grandfather has accused a couple of discrimination in getting out of work, after receiving a message sent incorrectly by a mother, who complains that she was "another colored man."
The couple have denied that they are racist, considering the charge as "decommissioning."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that her new grandfather Giselle Maurice was a colourful woman, at the time she presented herself on the first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, ANOTHER MAN WITH CLOSE," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to New York Post, after understanding her pocket, Plasco-Flaxman, "suffered in shame", stopped Ms. Maurice, reasoning that their current grandfather, who was African-American, had done a weak job and that instead of her, she wanted a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and then sent home with a "gap in the pocket".
Now, Maurice is indicting the couple for compensation for dismissal from work, and is seeking compensation at $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was hired, even without contract.
"I want to tell them that they shouldn't do such things," she said to The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied claims that they were racist, saying that Maurice's removal was the right action, as they were afraid they could not believe it after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said wife Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But will you leave your children in the hands of a person to whom you have shown yourself innocent, even if it is wrong?
Your newborn child?
Tell me."
Considering the charge as "removal," Plasco said that he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you avenge anyone in this situation?
It's not something positive to do," Plasco, investment banker added.
While the issue has gone to court, the public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter indicates that Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not connect to a spoken gold
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for BBC, before he was inspired by a little playful bear to write the book for children, would be upset if his work would be rejected, adding that last year's 60-year publication of the book, last year after his death, contained "trouble and happiness".
As for Paddington, which she referred to as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"He was a quiet person and didn't boast," she said.
"Paddington was so true that it was the same as having a successful child: you feel proud of him even though it is not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave his own credit to Paddington."
My daughter was changing her life, and I was forced to say goodbye to her by phone.
After arriving, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in New York, where doctors were trying to save her life but without results.
"We didn't call me regularly to tell me it was very heavy, which didn't believe it would come out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received a call from Nad who told me that she would die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors had given to keep her heart at work were losing her effect and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a while ago and now everything's "behind".
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
In time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, traveling for the loss of her daughter, flew on a plane like other passengers -- who were not aware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down, and all the time I was crying.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight, I felt a great sadness for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who hold their tears post letters to prevent suicides in the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters of inspiration to a Wells bridge as well as phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "sticky" smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
People always said that his smile lights up every room."
However, he gave up work before changing his life, since it was "in a dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the person who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly worry that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "so that people know there are people who can help them and who they can talk to, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was upset, depressed or anything else," she said.
"Several days before Christmas noticed the change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas day -- when the children opened their gifts, he did not see them and did not take any action."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they should go beyond: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've been ruined.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the lead after the FBI's investigation begins
"I thought if we could give something similar to what he was looking for -- a limited investigation in time and object -- maybe we could bring some harmony," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "dispersing" among the many obstacles of the opponents.
Why didn't you want Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters to investigate the FBI?
Their excitement comes all as a result of time.
Elections for Congress are only 5 weeks away, on November 6th -- if Republicans get out badly as expected, they will be very weak in their efforts to select the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, commending them for supporting Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him I met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues her report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where there are currently 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to put an end to this situation and confirm it in the High Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came into power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has declared.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, has declared that there were about 1127 deserts last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the highest rates requested by human beings traffickers.
Penyani didn't make public comments.
Most deserters from North Korea receive support from South Korea.
Seoul has declared that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the largest border length with North Korea, and there can be more easily crossed than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected from numerous forces.
China considers foreign migrants to be extra-legal deserters, not refugees and often repatriates them with force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penián and their talks focused on late negotiations for denuclearisation.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean warhead without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no faith in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disband the first," said Mr. New during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosio calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic," and says he is not worthy to serve at the High Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the High Court's appointee Brett Kavanaugh "historic", and said that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the High Court.
Pelos made these comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think that if a woman had ever done so, people would say 'historic'," Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the charges that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his presentation speech, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some moments almost screamed or "takes his mouth" when he spoke about his family and the years of high school.
He accused the Democrats explicitly before the committee, calling charges against him "a grotesque attack and coordinated against his figure", organised by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential elections.
Peloi expressed her view that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the High Court, since she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he punished himself with those statements and with the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelos hesitated to answer the question if he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his appointment, and if the Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is incalculable not only for the High Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosio said.
Kavanaugh is currently a court in the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelos added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law on Compulsory Care or on Roe's case against Wade, since he is considered a conservative court.
At the sessions for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would exonerate certain decisions of the High Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "so well," said Pelosio.
And women should use it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of rage that explodes, and it can't take it to the end without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual.
She continued, "A woman who worked in a leading position helped me a lot, who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had seen a style that was always angry and started to cry, to tell the co-department, "You might think I'm upset and so I'm crying.
But I'm actually pissed off."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Lots are a way to express anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men dominated and at one point I found myself crying out of unbearable anger, was the moment when a larger woman caught me by the throat--a cold manager whom I had always been somewhat afraid-- pushed me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let others see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be glad they got to bother you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an out-of-marriage relationship on board a boat called "Monkey Business" and got out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, realized there was no reason why he didn't even think of running for president.
"This wasn't a well-balanced decision," she said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it "Seven Juices".
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had remained behind the fundraiser, promised it would not compete if it failed to raise $2 million.
But it was a useless war.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she only gave $250.
"Don't you think they're making me sit down?" she asked herself.
During his speech that he was not going to develop an official campaign, she was so excited — thanking the people who supported her, angry with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and sanitize voters instead of delegates, and angry with sexism — that she was killed.
"It seemed as if I had suffered a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to it.
"It looked like Kleinex was my sponsorship corporation.
I remember thinking what would people write in my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
Advantages of the US-China Trade War for Beijing
The first outbreaks of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the war is far from over, a split between the two countries can make an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning early this year, setting taxes on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most sensitive scale was the one that happened this week when new tariffs touched goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing is avenged "in kind" every time, finally setting tariffs from five to ten per cent over US$ 60 billion.
China has pledged to return the US with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is unlikely to surrender soon.
Removing the measures from Washington means surrendering yourself to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to bow publicly to the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its cards properly, the pressures coming from the US trade war could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, made quickly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic downturns in each of these countries, is something much more dangerous than what has been seen abroad," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the research centre for new American security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the devastated country by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure due to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Already, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, where you had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
About six million others still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated state.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or conditional assistance from the countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
Europe's team has won Ryder Cup 2018 after defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 with 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost 6 regular matches in European territory and has been winning this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe remembers the crown after the Danish captain's team, Thomas Bjorn, managed to get 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the player who made the most difficult of the tournament, led the first hit into the water and closed the 16th hole with 3 more shots than the assigned level, losing the match in front of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players who achieved the result 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played at his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played at eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all time on this tour, with 25.5 points in career.
"Normally, I don't cry but today I can't keep myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy we took the cup.
Success is the team, and I am happy that I had the opportunity to help them," Garcia voiced quite excitedly after the European team's victory.
He passed the word to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated the 2+1 American golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that beat Tiger Woods. I grew up seeing that player," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has statistics 13-21-3, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the largest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been making it difficult throughout the weekend to take the ball to the right place, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the high-caliber golf course throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing appearance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There were moments during this paradise when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought fast.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We're gonna regroup, work with PGA in America and with our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna go ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We've got to get the hat off.
They played better than us."
Newspapers about Red Tide: Focus on Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest reports by the Commission on Fish and the Living World (FWC) in Florida show a general drop in red batik concentrations in some Tampa Bay areas.
According to FWC, pollution levels have been reported to improve in the accounts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - a fact that suggests a fall in concentration.
The Red Batica has extended the pollution to a length of 130-mile coastal lines from the north of Pinellas to the south of the Lee Contest.
The contaminated areas can be located about 10 miles away on the coast of Countess Hillsborough County, but in less than last week.
The Red Batica has also been observed in Contenna Pasco.
During the past week average concentrations near or off the coast have been reported in Contenna, low and high concentrations in Contenna Hillsborough, data for high concentrations in Contenna Manatee, data for high concentrations near or off the coast, in Contenna Sarasota, data for medium concentrations in Contenna Charlotte, data for high concentrations near or off the coast, in Contenna Lee, and low concentrations in Contenna Collier.
In the accounts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier continue reports of difficulty in breathing.
Last week, there was no report of difficulty in breathing in northwest Florida.
