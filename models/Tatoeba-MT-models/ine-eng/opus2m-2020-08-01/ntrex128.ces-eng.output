Members of the Assembly are afraid that they will "seem to be Mupeti"
Some of the members of the Assembly are consolidated on the proposal that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the meeting across the political spectrum are afraid that the name may cause laughter.
One member on the Labour Party stated that his group is afraid that "it is a affair with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In volume twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member on the side of Plaid said that the group as a whole "unhappy" and proposed alternatives.
The Velske conservative stated that his group had access to a change in the name "with open thought", but noted that MWP was close to Muppet.
In this context, the English letter "w" is similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Commission's meeting, which is now preparing legislation to introduce a change of name, stated: "The final decision on how members of the general meeting will be called will, of course, be on their own."
The Law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals, where broad support was given the option of calling the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the meeting, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP version received the highest support in the public debate.
The members of the meetings clearly propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus may bring the concerns of President Elin Jones, who is to submit a legislative proposal over a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
The members of the meeting will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will go to vote on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will change to "North Macedonia".
The outgoing vote should resolve a ten-year ongoing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim in the Greek territory and repeatedly protests against the EU and NATO country membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite's change of name, said he would not vote.
However, representatives of the referendum, including the president of the Zoran Zaeva government, argue that the change of name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silenced because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I spoke to say that he used to be at every corner of the bar and church,” says Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
He thinks the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People meet today in another way," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people walk regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be right where they start."
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people of a kind that do not help the remaining saints in the quarter.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and that is why the day will soon come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into apartments will become members of churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose religious activities were not far away.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was standing in front of a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping mall in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild it, they ordered the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the "bells of the poor".
The expert who played the sound game in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irrevocable historical tool".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bellacre in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger bellacre in the church in Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather says no one has ever invented it at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders was played at St. Martin's, some of whom were called laymen of the church and others of the episcopal diocese.
The council of elders – the leading parish authority, consisting of secular representatives – sent a letter in July expressing concern that the diocese "will try to lower the costs" to the council of the elders, although the rental of the architects and designers that the diocese sent did not take part.
Some Pharisees complained about insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who drowned for humour
According to the official report, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who drowned in California for hummers on the day of the start of the humid season.
There was an attack in the morning about seven o'clock near the Beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had drowned with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he came to him with the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel pointed out that the call first considered the joy of catching lobster, but “then he realized that he was shouting, ‘Smooth me!
He kissed me!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had a broken entire area of the key bone.”
"I cried, 'Let all go out of the water: 'In the water there is a raven!' says Hamel.
The boy was critically taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered from a traumatic wound in the upper part of the body.
Investigation and security authorities closed 48 hours of beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetic market in Britain
Sainsbury's wants to build chains of Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's cosmetic streets in the style of a business house where specialized stores will be available.
Within the framework of a strong market for cosmetics in Great Britain, which has a value of 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household needs are decreasing, the streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 sales across the country. In the case of success, the next year will be extended to other sales.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find uses for the regalia used for television, microwaves and domestic needs.
Sainsbury's suggests that it doubles the size of the offer of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products and first introduces also brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also get the current range from the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees thanks to brand places similar to those in shops like Boots.
Supermarket also re-enters its make-up Boutique range, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are still demanding.
In addition, in two Saintsbury’s shops will test the concessions of the retailer Fragrance Shop. The first such shop was opened last week in Croydon to South London and will occur next year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Buying online and moving towards the daily purchase of a small amount of food in local stores means that supermarkets need more effort to attract people.
Director-General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says that sales will increasingly look like business houses, because a chain of supermarkets is trying to improve the supply of services and non-food products to combat discount sellers such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales of Argos and also introduced a series of Habitats, which are chains that he bought two years ago. As a result, sales of food and supplies have increased so much more profitable.
The previous attempt to recast the department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended unfavorably.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint company with Boots, but the merger ended after the dispute about the distribution of the proceeds from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold his 281 doctors for 125 million pounds of Celesio, who owns Lloyds’ network.
Lloyds has a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four sales.
Business Director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the look and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to consult customers.
Our brand range should satisfy all needs and the soft environment and the convenient location means that we are now presenting an attractive place for buying cosmetics that changes the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is "distorted" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the contract for 11 million pounds
The Dragons Dan Peter Jones series star "sucks" after the TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from the contract worth $11 million with his lifestyle brand in order to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and Truly's accessories.
The company of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of Gwynet Paltrov's actress.
Seventy-five-year-old moderator announced the departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby blew up the Dragons Day Peter Jones series by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business for the last time – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to well-informed sources, Jones “sucked up” when a television star at a busy Tuesday meeting in the center of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that the new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of domestic clothing and accessories to Truly.
The company was compared to Goop's actress Gwyneth Paltrow's brand and could double the wealth of Willoughby's moderator in the estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When a 70-year-old Willoughby on Instagram announced that he was leaving the True mark, Jones left Britain to one of his summer seats.
The unnamed source states: “Truly’s badge was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would secure her for a few decades ahead.
Her decision to leave was totally shocked.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the release was so close.
In the center of Marlow is the full warehouse of the goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderators of this Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could be a million-dollar investment in products from pillows and candles after clothing and household clothing and possible further delay in marking.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones for ten years and his wife, Tara Cappová.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and two-and-a-half-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
Couples ride together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin in moderating the I'm A Celebrity series on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We will not comment on his business."
Difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from reporters for a note that some consider to be "unfortunate president" and how he spoke well of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump answered with his ridiculous "voice" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in further meetings.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been suspended at the dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the U.S. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "responsive" response to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump, in his speech, expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the edge of a war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His attempt to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – the completion of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of the rest of the American soldiers to power.
And he defended his unusual access to information about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this overcrowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and showed up.
The waves of tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs found out that there was no need.
Although more than 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok were expelled from their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"In many cases they have unfortunately made it very clear that they do not require international aid, so it is a bit difficult," says Mrs. Sumbung.
The Save the Children is giving together a team that travels to Paul, but it is not yet clear if foreign personnel can work here.
Mr. Sutupo, a spokesperson for National Disasters, said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organizations could be helped.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the earth on the wrath of the Mother of Nature is still unpaved.
In Asia, however, tsunami shelters were built, but on other parts of the coast it is not common.
The apparent lack of sirens in Paul’s warning against tsunamis likely contributed to the loss of human life, even when warning was given.
Even at the best of times, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The infirmary ship that has been on duty in Lombok to help the earthquake victim is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it gets to the scene of a new affliction.
The improvement of poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodoa's election campaign and the president lost a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year he'll try again for an election, but his government is making a lot of money.
President Yoko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, when Muslims take a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed lives for more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have escaped their homes.

He threw his ball to the left and shot it to the remote point.
The gun flew high and directed to the right upper corner of the gate.
The ball finally jumped over the jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended up online.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as fast as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible.” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com server.
"I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn't think too much about it and shot at one touch."
Chelsea in the middle of time led 1-0 after the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Attacker Blues sent the passport back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted at half Liverpool.
Covac ball won fast.
Then he sent the ball to the beautiful streets of Hazard into the limelight.
He ran away from the defense and married the left to the remote tip next to Alsson Becker from Liverpool.
On the middle of the 15th hour, Liverpool in the League of Masters at the stadium of San Paolo in Italy, competes with the local team.
Chelsea will play on Thursday at 15 a.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster agency pointed out on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and tsunami waves sprang to 832.
The 7.5 degree earthquake hit Friday, caused waves up to 6 meters high, and trapped many people in the caretaker buildings, he said at the press conference of the Sotopo Purwo Nugro.
The city of Paul, which has more than 380 thousand inhabitants, was visited by worries about building.
Police arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
This morning there was a woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, and the police immediately started investigating the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street. Based on suspicion of murder, a 32-year-old man was arrested.
The police called people around who saw or heard anything to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "The investigation is just at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who moved near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose ship cameras could record something to contact us, because they can have important information for our investigation,"
Police spokesperson confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The police reported that they were investigating and are now informing their relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one can even get out of the building.
When he found out what happened, he wasn't able to say a word.
The residents now learned that it would take several hours before they could return home.
One man was told by the police that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There's a crying woman on the spot.
She's still saying, "That's terrible."
At 14 o'clock, there were two police deliveries behind the tape, and the next one was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the closed area who are monitoring the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 of September 30.
Socha Cromwell in Parliament recently became a threat to the "rewriting of history" dispute
His expulsion would be deserved because his fanatic Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroyed many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "stupidness" and "the intention of rewriting history."
President Cromwell of the John Goldsmith Society says: “In the ongoing debate on the removal of the soybeans, it was inevitable that one of the objectives would also be the character of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't order or commit iconoclassism in English civil wars.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The excellent creation of Cromwell, by whom Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is the author, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the character’s history, which many think is still worthy of being celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today it is a little less than in the late 19th century, to be the advocate of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of unfathomable historical debate.
Of course, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has created the following development of our nation and Cromwell is a well-identifiable position that represents one side of this process.
His success in the role of the Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pigs smashed by a Chinese farmer
According to local media, there has been an attack and slaughter of a pig farmer in southeastern China.
As the newspaper South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only the name "Yuan" was found dead with a blood clot in the bloodstream near the market in Liou-pchan-shuey in the province of Kuei-chau.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs on a regular basis on 30 May 2005 in the town of Si-ning in the province of Čching-chai.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he came with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the side door was open.
According to him, there was a big blood pressure in his stomach.
According to the information, during the forensic examination, it was confirmed that the 250 kilograms per farmer had broken down.
"The brother had his legs all bloody and torn," quoted the newspaper Guiyang Evening News, a brother named "Wu".
On the security camera record, see how Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig was locked up so that nobody else could think of it when the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Market representatives are allegedly dealing with the Yuan family for compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have come to pass in the past.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband on the farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically wounded.
About ten years ago, 300kg of pigs brought a Welsh farmer to the tractor and dragged him to the farmer's wife.
After the Oregon farmer ate his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "launcher".
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them enough respect," he said.
Residues of the Hurricane Rosa bring to the southwest U.S. strong rain
Hurricane Rosa is said to be weak and moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the days to come, but in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States, it will bring rain.
Within 5 hours of the morning of the east time, Rosa reached wind speed 137 km/h, representing Hurricane Category 1, and was 620 km south-east of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific, a low-pressure beam forms and moves east to the western US coast. On Monday, when Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California, it will be like a tropical storm and begins to push tropical moisture north to the southwest of the USA.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm drops on Monday.
The tropical humidity, then, with approaching low-pressure bravado in the following days, causes rains in the southwest of the United States.
Contaminations between 25 and 100 mm locally cause dangerous floodwaters, sutium currents and possible dry land in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause the precipitation to occur between 50 and 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the United States, especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm strikes are expected.
In the event of rapid deterioration of the conditions, due to the spread of the nature of the tropical rain, flood floods may occur.
Because of the dangers of tropical collisions, it would be very unwise to walk into the wilderness.
A strong rain may cause the cannons to become raging rivers, and storms bring local storm winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure bridge will bring strong local collisions on some parts of the southern coast of California.
A total of more than 13 mm may occur, which could lead to smaller sutina and sluices.
This will be the first rains in this region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning they begin to approach Arizona with isolated tropical eruptions and on Monday evening and on Tuesday the rain spreads.
On Tuesday a strong rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October we can expect intense heat changes across the United States, because the Arctic will start cooling, but in the tropical zone there will still be total heat.
This sometimes leads to sharp heat changes in short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the U.S. Wednesday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa there is a difference of almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try to expand their summer heat.
Most areas in the middle and east of the United States are expected to start in the hot autumn with temperatures of around 27 °C from the southern plains to the north of the USA.
In New York City it could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
In the first half of October, our long-term forecast shows a high probability of excessive temperatures in the east of the United States.
Brett Kavanaugh surveyed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the six television channels of a fourth-party candidate's statement on the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of having been sexually assaulted, allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued, and the voters interrupted the regular programmes with reports of a sudden Friday return: an agreement by Senator for Arizona Jeff Flake that the FBI will carry out a one-week prosecution.
Christine Ford told the senate court board that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had sat down at a high school party in drunkness and tried to dress her.
Kavanaugh, in his excited statement, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were following the event, which is reported by the Nielsen Agency.
The company calculated average monitoring at stations CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers for the other stations that issued statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble counting people looking at offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in play-off or sharing Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest follow-up from all stations when it was monitored by Nielsen's agency during the day hearing by an average of 5.69 million viewers.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest lasted even after the negotiations ended.
Senator Flake was the main character of the Friday drama.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning, as protestors were shouting at him when he was about to go to court.
CNN was able to live for a few minutes with his eyes closed and he let himself in.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are weak.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before the door was closed, he added more to the committee's meeting.
All cable and television networks were broadcast live later when the judicial commission was due to vote on the submission of the Kavanaugho nomination to vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only if the prosecution against the candidate was investigating the FBI next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially convinced the talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused criticism of Brexit 'politicians'
Prime Minister Theresa May, in a Sunday Times debate, accused the critics of his plan to abandon the European Union that the "politicians" about Britain's future and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the Prime Minister on the title page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to each other to choose their duties was "inexhaustible".
Shooting Waydea Simse: Police arrested Dieteon Simpson, who is suspected of the LSU player's death
Police arrested the suspect in case of a 20-year-old LSU gunshot by Wayde Simse.
The Baton Rouge police department reported that Dieteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of second-degree murder charges.
The authorities published a video with a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the Sims police said he lost his glasses.
According to the WABF channel that belongs to CBS, the police have secured glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson told the police after the interview that he shot Waydea.
According to the defense, the bail was set at $350 000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was head and neck injuries.
The Department thanks the police unit for Louisiana's refugees, criminal labs of state police, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in investigating which led to their arrest.
The sports director LSU Joe Alleva thanked local policemen for "drinking and trying for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was "shocked" and "shocked" by the team.
"That's what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Sopka chryl ash on Mexico City
Aspel, which flows from Popacatépetl, hits the southern quarter of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to get close to the volcano after the volcanic activity increased and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of riots and earthquakes.
On social networks, images of front glass cars covered with thin layers of ashes were discovered in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the mushroom, which is 72 kilometres (45 miles) south-east of the main city. The last earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017 and had a power of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the annual vote on independence with the Catalan separatists police
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting for independence with the police and thousands of people engaged in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first year of the independence vote distributed by Catalan.
Ordering policemen blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and dust color after them. The streets, which are usually flooded tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, too, the lines to which the police had to use their shoes were broken.
Groups supporting independence for several hours sang "Don't forget, We won't forgive" face-to-face the protesting steps of the Union that called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, fourteen people were easily injured in protests.
The year following the 1st of October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but separatist Catalans to celebrate, remains a tension in the region that continues to seek independence.
Most voters spoke for independence, but participation in the elections was low, because resistance to the polls boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes throughout the region tried to end the vote in the polls.
The independence support groups stayed out on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration was going on, but she had to choose another route.
Eighty-year electrician Narcis Termes, who joined a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes to gain independence for Catalan.
“Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
My parents cried out with joy that they could vote, but now we're in the blind alley," he said.
Despite the important fact, although the close victory in the regional elections last December of the Catalan party supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either themselves went into exile or waited in court for their participation in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-two years old Mounter Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said that the conflict had inspired politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that next year he will run for the European Parliament.
"Candidate in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression that we have witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men incarcerated after the car crash into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car was repeatedly attacked in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 19:30 local time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, someone may have shot the car out of the car.
Meng's strike secured Livingstone's victory 1-0 over Rangers
First goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston, who came down from the lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard a second defeat of 18 matches in the role of the Ibrox Club Manager.
The Tref Dolly Mengy proved decisive when Gary Holt's team arrived at the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team this season has not yet won the Premiership League at the guest playground and next Sunday it will be built by the first Hearts, which loses eight points.
The Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Livingston has extended a series of unbeatable matches in the division to six matches, so the chief coach Holt, who set up Kenny Miller last month, has not yet attempted defeat.
Livingston didn't take advantage of the opportunity against unremarkable guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time ago because his presence caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he failed at the front door, and then Alan Lithgow in the lock just passed Craig Halkett's head in front of the door.
The domestics had enough to watch Rangers play before them because they knew that guests could have a standard situation.
And so came the key target.
Against Rangers he was ordered a free dome and Livingston created a cave, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Meng together, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the peace zone.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the holding of the ball, but the domestic defense for them was inescapable and Liam Kelly, most of the time, didn't have much work to do.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos made Kelly attack.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers Allan McGregora and Lithgow from meeting with another standard situation in Livingstone.
In the rest area of Livingstone, the centers were constantly flying, which the players were constantly cleaning, and two penaltyd graves came outside – after Halket's attack on the deputy Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
"Fenome" from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were, without exception, excellent and still surpassing expectations on their way up.
Their style of games and the crew have almost changed since the return to the peak, but Holt deserves a great praise for how the team has exploded since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a very organized defense, while Menga kept up all the time in the emergency of Connor Goldson and Joe Worall.
Rangers have a lack of inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrad, but these standards don't fit anymore.
Their finals were chabá – only once penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up, because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Kolina
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29th) at breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and everyone laughed.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have not agreed on a number of issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to the Colin, where he opened a huge new mixture.
There is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey in this city.
The police for security reasons prevented 25 thousand people from meeting in front of the mixture, but in the area there were many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them were Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Controversial protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others condemned as an autocrat.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist died after crashing with a car
In London, a cyclist died after a car crash.
There was an accident about 10:15 local time near the Bewood Street crossroad with the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and soon the ambulance arrived, but the man was dead.
The death occurred only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the site of the Saturday tragedy in an accident on the Children Street, when the driver was caught.
The Metropolitan Police reported that the police are now trying to identify and inform their relatives.
The road is closed, buses are driving on replacement routes, and drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: In trouble, six guards were injured
According to the prison's office, six guards were injured in the men's prison emergency.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday about 9:30 local time and continue.
In order to manage the emergency involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialty guards from the Tornádo team were called.
The guards suffered mild injuries and were treated locally.
Speaking of prison services, he said: “To handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, special training was being given to prison workers.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend a longer time on the networks."
In Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison ended after the arrest in the hospital.
And last October they were called to prison for serious disturbances, where personnel were attacked by bullet bullets.
Hurikán Rosa threatens with the waters of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can prosper)
It is not customary for Arizona to hit the tropical bank of low pressure, but it will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of the hurricane of Rosa exceeds the desert southwest and poses a risk of flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued a warning warning against floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona for South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be released on Tuesday through Phoenix and will bring rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have been kept within 320 km of the tropical storm or below since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Mountains, it is likely to fall between 25 and 50 mm, with local edges up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the area has hit dry.
The floods are a very serious thing, but they may even help because the southwest of the United States has just hit the drought.
Server weather.com states that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor service, Arizona enjoys at least 40 % of the "extreme dry" which is the second highest category.
The Hurricane Rosa route will lead first to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the force of hurricane with maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at speed 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet up with the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and then it will end.
It is expected that he will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, collisions will be strong, which is a major risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to the northwest Sonor, total drops of 75 to 150 mm are expected, and can occur up to 250 mm,” says the weather.com server.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and on Tuesday in early hours arrives at the border of Arizona. Then she passes Arizona and on Tuesday in late evening enters the southern Utah.
"The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very severe shocks in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the USA," the National Hurricane Centre informs.
These rains are expected to cause deadlyly dangerous flooding and sutin floods in the deserts and droughts of the soil in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three generations of boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsummer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
According to police from Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
The cops are looking for witnesses who could have on the phone a record of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "tried to destroy and destroy" Democratic parties
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugha is a rejection of the neutral and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that during the process of his nomination, Kavanaugh "tasteed the nullity and rebellion" of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh spoke before Congress, where he resolutely and emotionally refused to call Christine Blasey Ford, that she was sexually assaulted several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also made a statement about her accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American witnesses of Kavanaugh's splendor and quality and courage were on that day".
The representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that "the voice of Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service on his account".
The President indirectly called on Kavanaugh's nomination to discuss how important it is for the Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks ago one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't hesitate, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump stated that the Democrats had decided to "resistance and obstruction".
The Head of the Republican Party advised CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the ground of the Senate was expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to increase
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after widespread earthquakes and tsunamis struck the island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people lost their lives, including many of the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Palu, hundreds of people met at the festival on Friday. However, during the summer, the coasts hit up six - foot - wide waves that killed many and destroyed everything that was on their way.
There was an earthquake of 7.5 degrees in the waves.
"When the threat of tsunamis came up yesterday, people continued in the activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they fell for the victim," said the spokesperson of the Indonesian Agency for Relieving the BNPB Sutopo Purvo Nugro on the Briffin in Jakarta.
"The waves didn't go by themselves, took cars, buildings, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said, adding that before the attack on the coast, the waves on the open sea spread 800 km/h.
He pointed out that some people in front of the wave fled to the trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerial photographs published by the abatement agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and mixed with water.
The consequences shook the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by Friday's strong shocks was approximately 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb force released for World War II in Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of the long, narrow bays, which could have increased even more by the waves.
He described the damage as "broad" and said that there were thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the stakes of fallen buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Dongala, which is near the earthquake epicenter.
According to him, the communication was "fully protected without any information" from Dongala.
In his statement, the Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that his workers and volunteers are heading into the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," says the statement.
On Saturday, the agency encountered considerable criticism because it did not inform Paul that she had hit waves with tsunamis, even though the authorities indicated that waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
On amateur recordings shared on social media, it is heard that a man on the higher floor of the building with desperate scream warns people on the street from approaching tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the coast will hit a water wall that links buildings and cars.
The Reuters Agency was unable to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and wave of tsunamis caused a major failure of the power plant that disrupted communication in the Pale area, so the authorities could only coordinate rescue work difficultly.
According to the military authorities, it started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only to transport aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Dongala arrived in the city of Paul, where the employees were hiding in shelters from the customs of office buildings, they saw the images of the riots on their way, says Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups initiated a sad disaster relief work, some complained that foreign workers with great experience should not come to Paul.
According to Indonesian legislation, there may begin to be funding, resources and personnel from abroad until the national disaster zone is declared.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," says the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says “OK, this is a national disaster”, we can start international aid, but it is not yet.”
When Paul was born the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunamis, friends and relatives of those who are still deaf were still hoping that their love would be those miracles that would alleviate the grim stories of natural disasters.
They pulled out of the little boy's canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been imprisoned for two days by her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in the Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaghi, were his students.
"As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon figured out how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the announcement of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent news via WhatsApp competing from Pala, who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of two blue clips, his reports ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means that the reports have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took 26 750 USD while supplementing ATMs in Newport on the Levee
According to the police department's press report in Newport, on Friday morning, the thief was dismissed by 26 750 USD workers from Brink in addition to the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As stated in the report by Detective Dennis McCarthy, the car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put another money into it.
When he did so, another man "run behind Brink's employee" and stole a wallet with money to be put into the ATM.
According to the press report, several suspected persons fled the scene, but the police did not identify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, please contact the police in Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes its name – on Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
For 40 years West has a last name Ye for a while and a pseudonym used as the name of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change comes before his show in Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show, he replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "sense reasons", as the creator of the series said.
West had already said that the word for him was of religious significance, apart from the abbreviation of the existing professional name.
“In my opinion, yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where “these” means,” West was told at the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with the voice moderator Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to the only Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
The name has changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's co-worker JAY-Z on his behalf also wrote regularly with the associate and without him and the big and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the approaching 50th anniversary of the bloody attack on students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
At a time when left student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 began shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published an AI announcement, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan to be the only one in innovative AIs by 2030.
"The duplication of the AI research budget would be a good start because all other countries are far beyond the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in an interview for CNBC that double funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in AI will be made in the USA.
Lee, who published his book "Superpowers AI: China, Silicon Valley and a new world order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face++.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on the AI system, which won the best American player in the game Othello, and later was the leader of Microsoft's research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed the previous U.S. government technology competition, as was the Robotic challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be further to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
"Academia does not take China, but corporate," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been employing the best experts from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve the efforts in the area of AI, according to Lee, the United States could also help to change immigration policy.
"I think the doctors in AI should be automatically offered green cards," he says.
The Chinese State Council issued a plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organisations are giving money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The U.S. Ministry of Defence established this year the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is to involve partners from the sector and from the academic environment, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee of the Selection for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in the initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF funding is concerned, the AI now invests more than USD 100 million a year in research.
However, the US legislation, which wanted to set up the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not failed for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum whether they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, people from Macedonia voted in the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve an old dispute with Greece for decades, blocking EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim in its territory and therefore vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments have concluded the proposed new name agreement in June, but nationalist opponents deny that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for boycott raised doubts as to whether the required minimum 50 per cent of voters would be delivered to the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you to join NATO and the EU with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?"
The beneficiaries of the change of name, including the president of the Zoran Zaeva government, claim that it is the price that is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
The referendum is not mandatory, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will be guided by the result of the vote.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, electoral participation was only 16 per cent versus 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters finally gave up their vote.
"I went to choose for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old volunteer from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are voting in the Macedonian referendum on the change of name, which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls chairs from the states of the people who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with the head concerned, not the door for the service," Kavadarkov says.
“We are poor countries, but we are proud.
If we are not wanted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring about Macedonia, which has a level of unemployment of more than 20 %, so much investment as is necessary.
"I think the vast majority will be for, because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
According to him, the result of "yes" would be "to confirm our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could participate between 30 and 43 percent of the voters – which is less than the required participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV station found that 57 per cent of respondents were willing to vote on Sunday.
70 % of them said they'd choose yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first major wound to the policy of the Western government since its accession last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for a target across the whole of Brighton's defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling set up Brighton's defense on Saturday, thus securing Manchester City won 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the course of Aguera's administration, his goal in 65 minutes seemed ridiculously easy.
It all started with a recording that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He sprang between three Brighton defenders and got into the open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green robes.
At the edge of Brighton's subterranean territory, he was surrounded by one of the defenders, and he ran several more.
The next recording on the left found Sterling.
The English attacker attached the ball in the buffer area back to Aguer, who with his right hand crossed Brighton Mathew Ryan's gunshot to the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," reported the reporters of the City Pep Guardiola.
“We thought it would be 55 or 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky to have scored at this point."
The first advantage for Sky Blues in this Premier League match was set up by Sterling.
This target fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane worked the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote point.
Attacker Sky Blues placed the ball on the net just before he broke out of the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were cut off from the play-off fight, there were not many reasons to do it again.
But forever competitive Scherzer hopes that he will be placed on the spot on Sunday in the fight against Colorado Rockies – but only when they have Rockies, who run in the NL West for a match over Los Angeles Dodgers, hoping for play-off.
Rockies secured at least a wild card winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least fight because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I have this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play?"
Nationals haven't announced who's going to start on Sunday, but they're supposed to stay away from running Scherzer for this.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start.
This season, Washington's direct broadcaster has 18-7 statistics with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 changes.
Trump went to a meeting in West Virginia
The President spoke directly about the situation of his candidate at the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican elections in the mid-term.
"In November there will be a bet for everything we've done.
In one of the most important choices in our lives, there are five weeks left.
It's one of the big, big – I don't hesitate, but we're still moving and fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take over with any necessary means, you see here vanity, resistance.
They don't care who gets hurt, who has to beat to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying that the Democrats are "enragment and evil and resistance and slander."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, which led to a loud burst of applause.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you produce the document?
Uh, what?
No, um, wait – it was really the wrong word of the body – the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a varied voice stream.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions
When moment activists in my local party voted for my reminders, there was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who said they were not welcome – because they sincerely said their opinion.
My colleagues in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, were treated similarly because she was firmly anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I was a local member of Parliament on the Labour Party, the GC meeting on Friday night was exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of today's meetings do not fail, and the promise of "more kind, more polite" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different views on the Labour Party are not tolerated and each opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the Party to take the lead.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader. My colleagues, whom I had previously thought we had similar political views, were all of a sudden expecting me to turn around 180° and stand up for a position that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it was national security or the single market in the EU.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t even matter what I say – then there’s a tyranny on social networks where they call for my appeal, they judge the policy of the center and tell me that I shouldn’t be on the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because comments are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face every day the lure of sexist or racist abuses, but they will never get there.
One of the aspects of this era of politics, from which I am most disappointed, is how insults become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this varied flow of views, and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I have been advised many times to stay back, not so much to look back and then "I'll be fine".
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school disciple, the anxiety caused by the government of Margaret Thatcher, who let my class of general schools literally disintegrate, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local council member or as a government minister.
I've never kept my policy hidden in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would just say that when the country goes to Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not about Momento in Nottingham, but about my wishes, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of withdrawal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air climbs to the top
The two late fives drew a little off the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful fun game Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're in front of the tables as the only failure.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the chance that helped the home win, and Peter Murchie's viewer had the full right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we have been through great trials and we are still not defeated, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says: “All honor to Ayr, they got a better chance than we did.”
Five Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, modified by Frazier Climem, sent Ayr before, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, which was released by the Warriors for the match, enabled Melrose to use the arithmetic weights and Jason Baggot got the unaltered five.
The climate increased Air's lead to the Penalties, and then exactly in time he scored and changed his solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and five Patrick Anderson, changed by Baggot, reduced lead to five points.
Then there was a further detention due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground on the carrier, and when he started playing again, Ayr again promoted through the five Stafford McDowall, which changed the climate.
The deputy captain of Airu Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose used the players again thanks to Bruce Colvin's unchanging five after a short strong pressure.
However, the house came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for the attack on the ball-free climate, MacPherson from the Penal Service put the ball behind the moving little Air.
The climate changed, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's head and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five households.
Star Still Game starts a new career in hospitality
It seems that the Still Game Ford Kieran star is moving into the hospitality sector. It was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 16-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvise in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he plays together with a long-term comedy partner named Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last series of the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, Arigermorn Limited is the Director.
The actor refused to comment, but the Scottish Sun's source indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the "prosperous business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are watching over the Marine Command in La Paz, which is acquired by last year.
Over the public buildings are blue flags in the ocean color.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the word: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to get it."
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost in Chile's benefit in the blood war on resources in the 19th century – as much as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These desires may be greater than decades, because Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision that should fall on 1 October after five years of accounting.
"Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow MSD's decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile must act on Bolivia's sovereign approach to the sea.
Charismatic native president Bolivia Evo Morales – who has a controversial fight to re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia – and even if that happened, it would not change much.
This United Nations authority with a residence in the Netherlands has no power to assign to any Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, not only did they support Bolivia, but they may have made her more angry.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the existing Bolivian government," Zárate says.
He adds that Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries have not exchanged e - mails since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday he will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance "to end 139 years of conflict with each other's advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also refused to use the question of the sea as a political barricade – one of the most popular presidents in Latin America.
"The disease never surrenders its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless the United States can believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never defend its nuclear weapons as the first if he can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the U.N. Valne meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after the US foreign minister Mike Pompeo is about to resume a nuclear diplomacy that hung on the dead point for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says that they are "planut hope", that lasting sanctions and the US opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on its knees.
Washington is careful with regard to consent to the declaration if Phjongang does not take significant steps first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, universal skepticism prevails that Pchjongang really thinks that this arsenal will be abandoned, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' reviews show that your fashion shops will soon reach the latest trend of huge head coverings
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is at the end.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a number of massive head coverings for their summer/summer 2019 collection on a survey that all accepted during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats this summer flooded Instagram and these designers sent their exciting creations to the ground.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was overcrowded with a wide-ranging reminder of feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other excessively large supplements were decorated melons, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not intended to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the petro-colored masks have protected lips and remind more of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the creatures resembled the diving equipment with snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a cornet with broken ice.
And if you're going to go on with this huge mode, you're lucky.
Modern experts predict that huge caps could also reach fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a half-metre straw with a wide cream worn by all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind this very unpractice hat that flooded the social media has sent to the observatory mollusks another huge creation – the strawed beach bag, which is almost as big as the model in the swimwear that carries it.
The dark orange rafia bag lemovated by rafia shakes and equipped with white leather gloves was the fashion exhibition piece of La Riviera Spring/Year 2019 from Jacquemuse.
Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large blankets and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next summer – since the designer had so much success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive additions.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic achievements and continue to have excellent results in 2018. Individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) represents them and tries to ensure their pupils and parents the best level of service.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we note that modern languages are still popular and requested in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person’s language that he understands, it goes right to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes right to his heart."
This is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's trials show that languages are first of all tables, with no higher success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned a foreign language achieved the best A.
Data gathered from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 per cent of Mandarin students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages like the subjects that disciples choose are in the study plans of independent and other schools as well as those of STEM (sciences, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The study carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17% of the language skills are insufficient for reasons that employers are putting into question as a problem in the possession of vacancies.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career.
As more and more working opportunities require languages, these skills are needed in a globalised world.
Whether a person chooses a career or another language, he will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries, people who speak more languages will automatically benefit from competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouTube in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them failed to speak in a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, while the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15%, was French.
It is therefore important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially languages that are developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Every school in Scotland varies from language to language.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others learn languages that are considered most important for Britain in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have independent schools to choose from several languages with teachers who are in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing the educational environment that children prepare and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what lies ahead.
At this point, it cannot be argued that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and significance.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will be presented on Sunday in San Diego for the first time in Dress Lakers
Fans who are looking forward to the first time LeBron James becomes Los Angeles Lakers are soon waiting.
Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Sunday opening game scheduled for San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James is probably only playing a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James asked about his plans for six Lakers matches in the pre-season.
"I do not need pre-seasonal matches at this stage of my career," he said.
Trumpet performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today at Wheeling in West Virginia starts a wave of campaigning.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop at friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate to a vacant post in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate, as the Republic stands in November elections before the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's show start tonight and how can you watch it online?
The troupe meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 19:00 east time, today Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's host in West Virginia can watch online below through live YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about hearing candidates to the highest court of Brett Kavanaugh, which was held this week and was very drunk because of charges of inappropriate sexual behaviour. The confirmation of the Senate's vote is expected to be postponed for a week before the FBI's investigation takes place.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help the Republicans to take the pace before the November elections.
According to the Reuters agency, the organizers of President Trump's campaign say that these five meetings will aim to "give energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republics can try to protect and expand the majority of their representatives in the Senate and in the Chamber".
"Control over the Senate is so important for its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in this moving season," said Reuters spokesperson for Trump's campaign, which he did not want to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania might be able to watch the media from Pittsburgh today at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
It will be a second Saturday in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for Western Virginia Patrick Morrisey who is standing in the investigation.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president must come to help him in his research," says Reuters Politologist at Simon Haeder University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed that the stomach is supposed to fight to keep hope before Sunday alone
After three one-sided strikes, the Saturday doubles could be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
A hopeful coward is a completely thought-out sports concept, but players really believe it, and most of all, in such competitions.
So, where's the coyote going down now?
"They knew about six points and now there are four, so we take it so that the slope is probably moving a little further towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, it has four points, and there are twelve of them left.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in their posters, and there are many things they can encourage, such as the shape of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was dying on the transition from the fire to the green and he's going to be an example.
The famous screams were still strengthened in continuing his bike when he managed the key pat to win the whole match when they were with Thomas after two holes in the back.
His path that won them a 15-legged match met with a similar rifle that tells you that the American team isn't out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
That's all every one of these players left.
18 holes to leave the foot.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irreconcilable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely twos in Europe are four out of four and it can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only two who didn't hit the pit on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
This course and the way the energy flows towards the stormy audience confirms from it that these players are the target of Sunday victory, and that in the west of the sun over Le Golf National will not be the most popular player than Fleetwood or Molinaria.
Best both at the same time on a different hole.
However, the talk of European fame remains early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked briefly with Serge Garcia, a hero of early games with four balls when he was married to Alex Noren.
The cave and two dailies on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden into a trap they had not escaped.
But no one will help you on Sunday.
Two-fold games on two balls are so fascinating when you're closely following people's interactions in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team, and by the last day it has been a great leap, but this two game has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach for the fight, which some, especially from the states, have doubted.
To the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe by score 10-6 points
Europe will have a healthy advantage until the last day of Ryder Cup after the two games on Saturday came out on two balls with a leap of 10-6 across the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly won almost twice over the fighter Tiger Woods, decided to do four strikes in Le Golf National.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to maintain the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in early games on two balls with the American side that failed in series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but couldn't get to the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 fights to leave the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelist to win four points behind him, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game for two balls and then they beat the tired Woods and the American novelist Bryson Dechambeau even more important 5-4-4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, showed occasional brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game of two to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting after the early game on two balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the game of twos on the 2+1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - ones and threes in the world's ladder.
But Europe did not have it in this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris won all over the line.
Three major winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas were killed for the Americans on Saturday at two points.
They won the hard 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game for two balls and returned to defeat two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of two, although the first two holes lost.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history will the team return from a four-point deficit to a double, although as a defender of Furyk's party only needs a discount to get a trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that Sunday's attack is behind them.
North Korea says they don't "in no case" defend themselves unilaterally and without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued sanctions of the United Nations have deepened their confidence in the United States and that under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual annual wave meeting that North Korea had adopted in the past year "a significant measure of good will", such as stopping nuclear and rocket tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the right reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to arm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "step-by" access to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step-by-step, his statement was significant in that it did not refuse unilateral denuclearisation just because Pchjongang had already gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working on "denuclearising the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea is trying to formalize the end of the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States has said that Phjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call for the release of strong international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. continues to “denuclearize the first” and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve their goals, and even rejects the “declaration of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“I think that sanctions can bring us to our knees, are people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the USA, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an end."
However, this speech of Rio was dramatically different from that of last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korean missiles in the U.S. territory are inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN Trump, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work and sanctions must still be carried out until North Korea is completely denuclearised.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for it, he said: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Phjongang for the measures taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The prosecution of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue promptly and without stopping until we realize the complete, final, verifiable denouncing"
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes Phjongang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the U.N. General Assembly and Pompeo announced that next month they will visit Pchjongang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his final journey did not end well.
He left Phjongang in July and declared that progress had been made, just so North Korea would declare for several hours that he was entitled to "gangster requirements".
North Korea committed itself this month to meeting with Moon to dismantle the missile area and also a nuclear complex if the United States adopts "relevant measures".
He said Kim informed him that the "relevant measures" he hoped were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and directed towards normalising relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard with a participating course to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has taken all its students to sleep more, and it is in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night long when students sleep and encourage caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world's most advanced universities are often inadvertent when it comes to the basics of care for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who is thought to be the first species in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after teaching about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why are you telling me this right now, in my last year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains basic information to students about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall agreement.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the university decided to start a course after finding that the students were really not asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student colleges where students click on cups of coffee, locks, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another part, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in "studenting all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that there is also a problem of lack of sleep.
The supply of sleep of good quality should be a student's "secret weapon" for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even because it is not possible to collect, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into the mode of hunger, so man is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler propose a course that he graduated from one of his classes during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the whole course.
He hopes that by next step he will ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
The professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can determine your Circadian rhythm, leading to problems with swallowing.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga drowned Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy strike confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with the 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
Ibrox was trying to record his first victory from February 4th to February 1st at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused only the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the leading Leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago and the Rangers composition seemed uninspired and decided to settle.
While Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston jumps on the third and immediately behind the Hibernian team to one branch.
And it could happen to other Rangers' problems after the spell judge Calum Spence had been treated with head injury after he was probably hit by an object from the scene.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which moved around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would be happy to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponent on every step.
Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after Menga first left Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor, but the depositary buried his big chance.
A far-off cop of Keaghan Jacobse then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the last post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a four-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless met, but he will decide Steven Thomson removed the Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers managed only two shots to target in the first half, but ex-Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassany Coulibala and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening could have been against the running of the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserve it for the drink.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Meng to an easy finish.
Gerrard took the action at the stop and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost instant results when the wing got stuck in Morelos, but the impressive Kelly fought off the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long ball after another.
Holt's side was able to deepen its momentum in the final stages, but McGregor was well placed to block Jacobs before Litgow broke out of the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim for punishment when he was wrong with Jacobs, but Thomson turned around again.
German: Find Geiger's reader
And now the page of our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and still occurs... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter's science firm also became a standing pop of culture, as in a 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of the apparently unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s reader that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put this earpiece on, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive activity in minerals.
Evans: "Well, now it's really blowing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach an immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells has mixed ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their metabolism in the laboratory, so they can "see" the usual protein in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda in Maryland said: "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 explained that “it controls the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and "learned" was to focus on cancer cells, was already promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in the pro-trupopian preaching, in his maga hat, after his performance on SNL.
It didn't work too well.
Kanye West was released in a study on Saturday Night Live after a confused performance, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing the hat of Make America Great Again, he began swimming on the Democrats and repeated his support of President Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I were to be governed by racism, I wouldn't be in America long ago," he said.
SNL started a show parody with Matte Damon in the main role in which Hollywood star made fun of Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony before the senate court committee on the call for rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's theatre talk was recorded on social media by comedy Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West.
West also complained to the spectators that his beauty of his head had been eaten well in the back.
“In the background, I was ridiculed.
They said, "Don't go with that hat."
That's ridiculous!
They also said I was in the wrong place," Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman clothes, because that means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments served only to blow up the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL looked down, in frustration, says Variety, and one person even said, "The whole studio was completely quiet."
West was invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
The West has confused many present by singing song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most important characters: Thank you, Mr SES ESTABLISHED DAVU.”
But the visiting talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West was “just who it is, and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I DON’T REMEMBER someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “art”), whom I believe represents and broadcasts to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he is now "formerly known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and go in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, a lost musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast

The game Thrones star Kit Harington let himself into the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in the violent medieval fantasy of the HBO series.
Herec, 31 years old, however, came out of the stereotype macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to deserve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married to his star Star of Rose Leslie's throne, also 31, admitted that this problem is said to be "very strong".
"At this moment I feel personally, quite strongly - what became so bad about the masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenagers about the problem we see here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic men thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, make them feel that every man must have his own page?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do you change it?
Because young men must have changed something to worse.
In the discussion he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel games about thrones after the series is finished, because he already has enough "bodies and horses".
From November, Kit will play in the restored Right West Sam Shepard, who is the story of the film producer and his brother, thief.
The actor recently discovered that meeting with his current wife Rose for the best thing that ever happened from the Games about the throne.
"I met my wife during the show, so she gave me my future family and my whole life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of love of the Chinese character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series rated by Emma.
In June 2018, a couple took up residence on the grounds of Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China indicates 14% increase in new cases
China reported 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, this virus has affected more than 820,000 people.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, Chinese doctors have introduced at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is allegedly still widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up being treated as women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff would have avoided the data of the GOP senators, the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, US MEP Maxine Waters dismissed the claim that a member of its staff had sent personal data to the legislative bureaux of three republican American senators.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charge was supported by "super-legal" scientists and websites.
"False, lie and other reprehensible lies," Watersová said in his statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and published an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's discussion on the allegations of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
There were times after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which is the source of contributions, is linked to the Waters office and published information about members of the Waters staff, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the avoidance of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly served online criticism, including from the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Fleischer.
"This objection is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that it has no temperament to be a member of Congress."
If someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
It can't be embarrassing.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He must be calm and not upset."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing the Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized because during the quarter hearing he seemed to be too angry.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned “the competent authorities and authorities active in criminal proceedings against these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that believers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English again includes reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new movie with a British trend, which seems to be the case of this re-resurrection of Johnny English in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this hard satire be on the subject of how clearly we are a bad nation, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this crazy, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack things in a completely new way - that name is more than any other signal that a broad comic design is intended for the English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims on smoothie glamour has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a bean from Mr. Bean and a great bit of the guy who sang the only tone in the sun at the Chariots of Fire at the opening of the 2012 Olympics.
The building is also originally based on travellers and international secret men who Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV ads Barclaycard and who left chaos behind.
In this latest edition, there are one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny Englishe as he approached the helicopter in the middle of the shooting, and his rotor hats were squeaking about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed, but humor feels quite subdimensional and strangely redundant, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Nis itself now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being designed by children than adults, and for me, the crazy trampoos of Johnny Englishe are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that Britain has serious problems.
Cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field to scare the agent into service - to too little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last step for the prime minister, who is a pumping and curious character, who is already suffering from the complete destruction of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson's love for Theresa May character plays the best, but there is nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteurs inform her that once every active spy is in danger, she will have to return someone from retirement.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but at the same time teaches a record lesson about how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long-suffering partner, Bough, who played Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a commando ponorka, an affected character who may even have some looseness with the talent of Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in packing tasks for Her Majesty's secret services, and they are meeting with the beautiful woman of death Opheli Bulletin, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subject to the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the evil Jason Volta playing Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ods full of fresh potatoes: masked as Chinese burns the French restaurant; create chaos when they crash on board Volt's luxury yachts; and English will launch a clean anarchy when they try to get to know the interior of Volt's house with virtual reality.
All the essays are certainly prepared for this last sequence, but whether they are self-friendly or noisy, they have something on their children's television.
It's a rather moderate matter.
And just like the other movies of Johnny English, I couldn't think of it: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really fits his talent?
Labourers deny that they would develop an English plan to work four days a week to get paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and will be paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to transfer savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to employees.
Employees would have enjoyed a class weekend - but would still receive the same reward.
The sources claim that this idea would be "cast" into the economic agenda of the party and is planning to attract the country to the benefit of the workers.
The four-week shift was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to use changing economies.
For Sunday Times, a long - term Labourer said: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a week's work week is a wish that falls into the position of the party to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a week of work during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The Sunday work week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's work conference to fill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return the energy from "anonymous directors" and "knowers" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow clerk also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their overall share, because the Labour Government could carry out "commitments" on the basis of the alleged infringement.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees in company boards and create own funds to transfer 10 % of their own capital of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in a "60 minutes" series, whether the investigation of the FBI Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charge against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has removed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and raises the question of whether the investigation of the Office could attract some Republican senators to their support.
In a Sunday '60 minutes' interview, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would have had to change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charge came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, clear."
However , the Graham decision is inconceivable .
"I have already made my decision against Brett Kavanaugh and it would mean a truly explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the annual music event Global Citizen Festival will be held, which offers a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission after the end of world poverty.
The Festival Global Citizen in its seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to use not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Powery project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before he reached his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert really in a way of convincing them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people who feel that by signing on-line petitions or sending a tweet, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from his supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures of more than $37 billion to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion were already paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and developers who committed themselves "to help children grow to their full potential", which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help them end up in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of undercover,” said the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullmanová during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also noted that, following more than 5,000 actions called on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which accounts for 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on your website with a question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard journey — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil law and the movement against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of those who will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman this year.
The United States could use the Navy for "blocking" that would defend Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington can "if necessary" turn to the Navy to prevent the fall of Russian energy on markets including the Middle East, US Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is acting on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are on the Middle East is that they want to provide energy just as much as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to the official declaration, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the opportunity to use our shipping to ensure that the maritime routes are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke referred to participants in an action organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group that is referred to in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to invest more in or replace fuel," he said, and at the same time refers to Russia as a "single-purpose" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen exports of its fuelled natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia with a much cheaper version for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unavoidable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made from Berlin's "manufacturer" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is supposed to double the current capacity of the pipes at 110 billion feet of the ground, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's burning resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of some kind of competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perrym in September in Moscow.
The United States was interested in Germany's position, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is involved in our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "be close" to the presidential candidacy in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election period, the "closer look" on the presidential candidacy.
During the meeting of the councillor in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he considered the candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and make our broken government, including the top women's position," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will look closely at the presidential candidacy."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm afraid to death of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened in his criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “We obviously need an FBI poll before the vote.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most Warrens do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" volunteers from Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The research has shown greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for the candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
Other highly established democratic names, which were mentioned in connection with the potential candidacy by 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, can be about other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said the public at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulse, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little bit, returning healing, returning and wondering if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and flightmen and every other member of the army are giving their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, involving in the report of domestic violence and possession of alcohol weapons, said Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. supports the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of new measures by the American government, which attacks asylum victims who face gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and Friday in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, NBC said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case, which gave the American Civil Liberties Organisation in August, was not discovered.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but the US officials refused her asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations that are facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has reversed the decision of the Appeals Chamber for Migrants in 2014, which has enabled illegal immigrants who are fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In the Friday statement, Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. stated that the new measure “ignores the decade of state, federal and international law”.
"The Federal Act requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers further briefly argued that the policy that opposes immigrants' entry is damaging the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "give the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to share asylum with victims who are fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Assylis is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Zoufal rescue attempts in Pala, where the number of victims has doubled, competes in the search for survivors over time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her hot boy at the evacuation center in the washed town of Pala.
"Every minute the ambulance will bring another body.
Clean water is rare."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, choosing through the underworld and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were protected.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Harris, who suffered from the fracture of the paternity and the shoulder, were resting at Palu’s army hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continuing strong subsequent shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth floor, which shared the room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was attracted to the wall," Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "shiking" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the American newspaper devoted to the mutual benefits of trade between the USA and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's paid supplement in Des Moines - the state of the biggest sales news in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to merge into US Congress elections on November 6.
The troupe's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections marked what the U.S. representatives said that the Reuters agency was a new phase in the escalating campaign by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place commercials in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in the escalating trade war, which appears at the level of mutual imports.
Chinese legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to strike exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican side, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former former Governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this joke by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"When spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a valuable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the Beijing street, you will find limited inconsistencies and you will not see any real reflection of the inconsistencies that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic path, since the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of China's most important news refused to publish the offer", although he didn't say what newspapers.
Republicans leave their volleyballs in front of elections for debate with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
As many peak Republicans defend the candidate for Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaug, who faces several charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming elections in the middle of the period, they were aware of the response, especially from women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high, and most of the Republicans on the record are already saying they want to continue with their vote.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the last time trying to investigate the FBI will suffice to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors were running "The November is approaching!" at a demonstration in the Senate, where the Republicans, who are concerned by the judicial commission, decided to appoint Kavanaugh even through the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will keep records," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it was high already, that's true."
However, it could be higher, especially among the prominent women's voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age who do not like the president, but often do not go to elections."
Even before the public testimony of Ford detailing her allegations of sexual assault on the candidates of the highest court of analysis, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, they could have followed the resistance.
"The confused GOP disorder has been eliminated," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about voting in committee or about final voting, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits on the table, it's also about how the Republicans managed it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, US Priori Director, a group that helps choose Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in the view that they trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with some more sympathy for the second.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent indicated that they probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from the Flake FBI currently investigates the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, said The Guardian.
Ford testified before the senate court committee last week that the drunk Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
Web inventor World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt project was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about this start.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data repository" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all at the same time.
What is exceptional on the online data repository is that it is entirely for the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company refers to this as ‘personal power through data’.
The purpose of the Inrupt project is to bring resources, processes and skills to help the Solid platform to be available to everyone, according to John Bruce’s Director General.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some employees working on the project cooperated on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with "Facebook and Google don't talk about making a complete change, where all their business models are turned over to foot over the night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In his contribution to the media released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy who received Victoria Cross during World War I
Hundreds of years have passed since the only Church of England won Victoria’s cross as a warrior during World War I.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never knew that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons discovered a memorial stone on Saturday at the Rushden celebrations in Northamptonshire.
One of his cousins, Michael Vann, said it was "genially symbolic", that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the magazine London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense noise and a strong shot from the poles and kulometers."
Later, he got into the first line and with "the greatest courage" led the line before he threw himself into the burning field and knocked on three separate units.
Colonel Vanna killed the German shooter on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I would never manage, but at the same time something that is humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after a survey conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they placed a pen.
Michael Vann said that he “felt a great honour to be able to share in the audience” and added that “the courage of the right hero is manifested by the support that a lot of people give.”
MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, instead of getting Peppa pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night for you to watch the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to resist your main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts in the United Kingdom all night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed when the news turned into a show about the Peppa pig.
Some remained unresolved after they had waited until early morning for the match.
One of the fans on Twitter described a change in the show for children as "a certain form of bad joke."
"It is not appropriate to send children's programmes within 6 hours, according to the government regulation," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication to Bellator after being asked about this transfer.
"Peppa Prasátko", yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on a program so that future audiences in Britain would be involved.
"I think that when I think about the broadcast, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to do it until Sunday's time, Monday's time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of texts went back and forth and not everyone was exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It could be the government.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We reduce it to five matches instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried our best to keep the promise given to fans and did not succeed.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "decent" for sexuality
The Olympic jump in the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not all are like him."
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics because of the possibility of becoming a parent.
The regular moderator of the long series Kirsty Young had several months free of disease.
Daley, who appeared as a partisan in Lavern's first program, said he felt "less precious" than anyone else who grew up at the same time, because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, “So far, these feelings of inferiority and differentness have been real things that have given me strength and success.”
He wanted to prove that he was someone, said he didn't disappoint anyone who could find out what it was like with his sexuality.
The double holder of the bronze Olympic medal became a fighter for the right to move LGBT with a high profile and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he answered because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to add "hope".
This three-fold world champion said that he was in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – was "instigated by the unprepared."
Daley, the keeper of Oscar, who is 20 years older, took last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young, he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later,” he said, “it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar resurrections and falls.
Two of them adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June and Daley said that he had "changed the whole angle of view".
"If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't agree with his dying, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not impossible," he said.
The year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of the sights of our home at the Olympic Games, I don’t know how much better it feels,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first composition – the Spring of Heather Small – that reasoned with him at the start of the Olympics and was still the cause of thick skin.
The Desert Island Discs series is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, finished on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson would get a record Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he'd have to take the form to prevent it from being an unhappy militiaman.
Mickelson, who played events every two years on a double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the Saturday football and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the story, as was often the case in the United States, the five-star winner spent his day in a row between the cheerleaders and the work on the game in a row, which he hoped would fix what he was suffering.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most straightforward of drivers, and it is not at the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow field of Le Golf National, where the long-term member land regularly penalizes the astray shots.
And if the golf course isn't quite worrying about itself, Mickelson is facing the British Open Francesco Molinari’s nine-week match, which won all four of his matches this week in a team with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four fewer points, had started 12 independent swords, avoided a quick turn, the Mitchell sword could have proved to be a very basic one.
Furik expressed his trust in his husband and didn't add anything else.
"He completely understands the role he played today, he beat me behind his back, he put his hand around my shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
“He believes so much.
He's a member of the Blue Strip and in the past this week he was so very helpful to these teams.
I guess I didn't realize he was playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson wins Nick Falda's record in most of the Ryder Cup Westerns played on Sunday.
This could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup that never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 breakthroughs and seven remises, even though Furyk says his presence in the team has brought certain negligible results.
"He's fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun when they followed him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving it a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows from experience that great leadership towards singles from the last days at Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane started the game in 1997 in Valderrama, where the company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point jump over the Americans, but to the goal level they were achieved with a complete win of 1411⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You still have to remember that we had a big leap in Valderram, as well as in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won, but only closely," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching in 2018 when they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of this team showed me that it's not behind us.
You'll get bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not for you until all those points are on the table.
We've got a goal, and that's what we're trying to get the trophy, and we're going to focus on it.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players led in the difficult golf course, added: “I would never do that myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that's very difficult.
It's great to be out with your partner when it's okay, but if you're supposed to be alone there, your golf player's capacity is fully checked.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three points out of four.
Furik was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn to end up as a defeated when Europe reached the "miraculous in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question, how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to stop by the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 major matches, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When this pace goes in one direction, they put considerable pressure on the middle races.
So we set up a structure and made the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to launch an attack on Rorym McIlroy in the final match with the players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the upper half.
“I went with this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said about his selection of singles.
German new warship still suspended
The latest German shipping fleet was recognised in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one year due to faulty systems and snowed coasts, local media say.
The operation of the ‘Reinland-Pfalz’ ship, the completely new baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoted by the speaker army.
The vessel was expected to be part of the Navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was challenged by the heavy problems caused by the supplier.
As a replacement for the older cargo of the Bremen class, four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be served, which was ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with an executive work, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Another important feature is the long maintenance period – it should be possible to install the latest frragats for up to two years outside the home port.
The constant delay, however, means that the peak maritime vessels – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces to the sea – will be put into service by the time of the operation of the obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The failure of the F125 fleet was reached last year when the German Navy officially refused to bring the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to its manufacturers after the surrender.
The reason for the return was little known, but the German media quoted a number of key "software errors and metal-stamping drills" that would make the warship useless when entering the fight.
The software facilities were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate a crew of 120 sailors – half of the workers who needed Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7 000 tuna ship of the Rhineland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the metal performance, the cost of the whole project – including crew training – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price was EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates were especially important in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, confirmed that the naval forces really "come up with a capable deployment".
This representative pointed out that the problems had been permanently bottlenecked because the old ships had been removed from operation but no replacements had been provided.
He complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates are capable of being part of the marine equipment.
The National Trust Organization listens to the secret life of bats
On the site of bats in the highlands of Scotland, a new research is being carried out aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
There is hope that the discovery of research will shed new light on the behaviour of individual flying birds and help to manage future activities to preserve this species.
A study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will monitor the bats of stars and the smallest and brown long and watery in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas of this non-stop site, which will monitor the activities of non-stops throughout the entire annual period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of calling bats and what individual species are doing.
Next will be a map of the habitat and a message that creates a detailed landscape image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, an NTS conservation advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of a shell, and the best way to maintain forested areas for bats and other related species.
They don't fight the population in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain in the last century.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development affecting colonies and the natural environment.
The risk may also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as a trap on flies and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they hunt.
They use an intelligent echo-location technique to track the fractures and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out research, colony control and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has even established the first and only protected non-opposite reservation in the town of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's residence says it's an ideal area for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there is still too much we don't know about the victims, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive."
It underlines the importance of control of bats before the start of maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that unaware destruction of one mother nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, trouble them, disrupt or destroy their colony.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to add hand to work and help.
She said, "We have to learn a lot about our animals and many species that we don't know how to treat their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape and his lawyers are going to complain about the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo identified the charge of rape for “false news” and stated that people “want to see” using his name.
His lawyers are going to complain about the German journal Der Spiegel, who reported on these charges.
This Portuguese and attacker for Juventus was accused of rape of American Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he subsequently paid her $375 000 to keep quiet, reported Der Spiegel's newspaper on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the indictment information, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and marked the information as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-person prizeholder Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald’s lawyers are going to appeal to Der Spiegel’s journal for unsubstantiated accusations that they have referred to as “inadmissible allegations of suspicion in the private sector”.
Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last period.”
The alleged incident was due in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel apartment and at the casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg allegedly returned to the game, where she was reportedly raped by the court in the Clark County District Court district in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99%" "buy" and "one percent" disappointed.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and let her photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed with the extrajudicial arrangement because "she was afraid of revenge" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman claims that she is now trying to restore the proceedings, because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronalda at the time of the charge of the strike from the crossing to the Royal Madrid Club from Manchester United and this year he was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The Great Britain "will always regret" if after Brexit it loses its world leader status in the production of cars, the secretary for Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "anxious", that Toyota UK car reported to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnaston, near Derby.
"The agreement is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese car indicated that the impact of the delay on the borders in case Brexit agreement is not concluded could be a job.
In the race in Burnaston, where Auris and Avensis cars are manufactured, Toyota brands produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would notice a stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other cars, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the United Kingdom, spread fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, states that it will close its competition for the production of Mini cars in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what producers label as a risk to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of the "right of time" deliveries, and parts from suppliers in Britain and the EU are delivered for cars manufactured on an order within 37 minutes.
If Britain left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a breach at the border, which could, according to the sector, lead to delays and lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to work in a warehouse more than one day in the Derbyshire competition, the company has introduced, thereby stopping production.
Mr Clark said that Theresy May's plans for revitalising future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated so that these border controls do not arrive."
"We need an agreement. We want the best trade that will enable, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is a highly successful supply chain."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the competition and would ultimately be at the expense of the jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is president of the competition committees, said that the members of the board’s organizations are increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places are gone, they will never return.
The government said: "We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, introduces the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "a week away", because he continues to fight for the position of the highest judge with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is currently working on the work of the Special Council of Robert Mueller, which examines the intervention in the Russian elections, the links between the Trump sidekeepers and Russia and the possible judicial obstacles by the President.
Let Trump release the deputy general's powers and thus threaten Mueller's independence, Washington's bells have been on the line for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the wearing of a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president meeting through the 25th Appendix.
Rosenstein denied the message.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump stated that Rosenstein would not "be better" but then the meeting was delayed so as not to interfere with the hearing with the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, and the Senate's full vote was delayed again.
Trump's press spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday in the Fox channel.
To a question at a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, perhaps another week's motion will be necessary in view of all the other things that are going on at the highest court.
But we'll see and I'll always communicate the latest information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not arranged a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were caused by an averaging of TV reporters, even though she said, "I don't agree with the fact that it's coming out."
She then proposed that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press should be increased.
"The President is holding more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving evidence. "We were looking at the numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press representatives were able to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and that there's a real press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high representatives.
Lonely press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York probably showed why he and his released and sometimes bizarrely met reporters.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid fear of Brexit
The Ministry of Health wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's SME sent a letter not even six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to incuring the costs of applying for the status of EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “This year, negotiations between Britain and the EU continue on the retreat and are heading towards the expected decision in the autumn.
However, the British Government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible withdrawal scenario without an agreement.
I know it must be a very distressing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
EU-wide colleagues also bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to the patients and communities we provide.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our desire is to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie performs emergency surgery after head injury
Moved defender Tigers of Tennessee Christian Abercrombie submitted an emergency surgery after he suffered head injury in Saturday's defeat 31-27 from the opponent of Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before noon.
"He came to the side row and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and health professionals put Abercrombie on the side row of oxygen and then put it on the carrier and prepared for further assessment.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had submitted surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no injury type/range details" are available to date and that the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second in the red shirt, completes the first season for the state of Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total steps, which means a total of 18 steps in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax than real estate when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, and the money will also be used to help homeless people within the framework of the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's knowledge, which aims to attract young voters
The increase in the obligation to pay higher taxes on property will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
An increase of £ 120 million per year is expected to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay higher taxes on the purchase of real estate when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, and money will also be used to help people without a home, announced today by Theresa May.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of attracting Jeremy Corby to attract young volunteers with the promise to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in real estate tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the money will also strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleepless sleep over their heads.
The premium, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay the property tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in other houses and the purchase for rent, may reach up to three per cent.
It is estimated that up to £ 120 million per year will be raised in the State Treasury.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 per cent of citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, making it easier for those who buy for the first time to get on the ladder at home.
Many of the rich areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become "the cities of spirits" just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new principles emerged only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after tax reductions from the purchase of property to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking the land, but not using it, and insisting on Mrs. May to get the quotas from affordable houses to repair the "dwelling of houses" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rental management and termination of "unusual" removals.
It also wants to increase the power of committees to build new homes.
Mrs. May stated: “Last year, I said that I wanted to dedicate my efforts as a prime minister of the renewal of the British dream – to make every new generation a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged property market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities not living in Britain and for foreign companies to buy houses as well as hard-working residents of the United Kingdom.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the foam of sleep without a roof over their head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says he is his "highest ambition" to become at a certain stage manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently stands in the third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiery League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got value B and that was it," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
But such an opportunity would come only if I was successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors in the role of Sunderland managers were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety about the consequences of such a name-based club when he previously turned down pre-games from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“A success would then be measured by whether I can get this club back to Prime Minister League.
The structure and equipment in this club are undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him back there, but I think I'd be successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross has been a career manager for just three years, before acting as assistant chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then he helped the club Alloa get back from joining the third group and transformed St Mirren from the beginning of the fall to the winner of the title of the champions immediately in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he ever had in his career players in the clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," recalls the time when Alloa looked up.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good and using reasonable amounts.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I'm still going through them from stress and pressure to work, but I just have a good feeling in my management.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I do, I feel that I feel the most in my adult life now in my skin."

Research found that great time for painting is Saturday at 17:30
The summer winds increased the revenues of British households facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that households and bar groups recorded an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting firm, who produced final reports, said: “The stable sunlight and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as previous June, when the house’s visit increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The drop in restaurant markets by 1.8 per cent in June has worsened in July.
The houses and bars of drinking have so far been as strong as the restaurants have become worse.
Gentlemen whose main markets are from food also suffered from the sun, even though not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent decreased."
Paul Newman, an analytical company for leisure activities and hospitality, stated: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has lasted since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of significant social or sports events are the main factors in domestic sales.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual drop in sales by 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in the light of current pressures on costs.
The long hot summer can't be a worse time for food-stricken business operators and time will tell if the smaller temperatures that we experienced in August will bring so much needed relief."
Total sales growth in households and restaurants, including newly opened ones, accounted for 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the British household, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an industrial scale in the sector..
Every fifth child has a secret account on social networks that they hide from their parents
Every fifth child, aged only 11 years, has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators, shows research
Research among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “false Instagram sites”
Reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students have indicated that they have a "main" account that parents know about
Every fifth child — only 11 years of age — creates social media accounts that are hidden from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in "false Instagram accounts", where photographs are shared.
The reports indicate that there is concern about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have an attractive “main” account that parents know about and at the same time have a private account.
One mother who attacked her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that her teenager was urging others to "violently rape her."
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) independent schools showed that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half admitting that they are running private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where their parents and educators cannot find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated light athlete and President Ian Beattie described moving as a great opportunity for those who are in sports management like those who will benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level in the past decade.
"Eildh has extensive respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that it will be of great benefit to athletes in Scotland when he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I will be truly successful and that I will help to conduct sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the 1996 Olympic Games, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I went through an attack a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it's only time to show if I'm going to get well or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to make a full recovery, he's learned to walk again, and I've got practice today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk dispenser triggering mother-to-cow comparison shares views online
The company that is involved in the production of the sows has distributed an online opinion on advertising that compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
In the context of the launch of the "first silent portable suction system in the world", Envi has released a music video showing the freedom that the new suction system gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows on a song with the text: “Yes, I feel, but you don’t see any eyeballs” and “In case you haven’t noticed that I’m not pregnant, my chest is here.”
The congregation continues: “Smash, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk. ”
The advertisement, which was published on the corporate facebook page, however, triggered an online controversial response.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and it received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said that it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to misuse cows on advertising for this product.
Just as we have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
Elvie wiper is discreetly applied to the breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Intellectually traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why don't you abuse them for advertising on a breast pump for mothers who leave their children?"
Someone else added: “That advertisement is completely out of the question.”
There were also those who defended advertising, and one woman admitted that the composition was considered "infectious".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd get that pump if I kept pushing.
I feel just like a cow when I'm done.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's for the thing.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Others added: “It’s a fun commercial focused on mothers who are dissipating milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like “cows”.
It's not a commercial that's supposed to raise or lose the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet repellents hidden under the pillow.
The concept of campaign is based on the observation that many women who sow milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely quiet, has no wires and no hats and is beautifully hidden in the back of the thigh, so gives women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding the child and even walking away.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, commented: “Elvie is a revolutionary product so much that it deserves significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point to the removal of milk and all the challenges associated with it, but to show a fun and reliable sense of freedom that will secure the new breeder.
It's not the first time Elvie's detachment got off.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mothers of the designer Marta Jakubowski, who was using the product, appeared at the mill.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to the camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants increased rapidly despite the fact that monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the strong rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration made it easier to accommodate children with follow-up.
Most accompanying immigrants were traditionally created without documents that were afraid of being able to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other mature members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer at the Congress, testified that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of escorts of lonely non-violents.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80% of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to fight them," said Mr. Albace.
According to the workers of the asylum facilities, representatives have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought before the court within the month of their detention instead of the previous 60 days.
Many will appear through videoconferencing instead of declaring their case legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who don't have a warrant for help will be deported quickly.
As long as the child is in custody, he is more likely to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of emigration or attempts to escape, hard workers of asylum facilities and reports from the system over the last few months.
The lawyers say that these concerns are raised in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs of the child being lost are more likely not to be noticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a camp without enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could lead to a trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria announced that they had to download American, French and Turkish "occupational components" immediately
During the general meeting of the United Nations Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moual also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the country's eight-year war is already under way.
Moual, who is also a representative prime minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegal, under the auspices of the fight against terrorism and that "it will be established accordingly".
"It must be given up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem argued that "the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over", with more than 360 000 deaths since 2011, and millions more lost their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue in "fighting this holy battle until we free all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present foreigners."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria that are mainly trained by the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting with President Bashar al-Assad and advise them.
France has more than 1,000 units of war in the region.
In issuing refugees, Moual stated that they had good conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "national concerns", which caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Police what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war-end opposition.
The diplomats of the United Nations state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a security zone in the last Idlib attack created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented the massive attack by the Syrian forces protected by Russia in a province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will focus on jihadists, including members of the Nusra Front, who are bound to Al-Qaeda.
A United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to propose a military constitution for Syria and to postpone the elections will take place.
Mouale laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to the control of the existing constitutions" and issued a warning before the infringement.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win in other elections in 2020, even if, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, the charges and early scandals of his office as President would not be over.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finals of the presidential period in history!"
So far, there's no sign of any subsequent kidnapping.
Since 2014, monitoring in the main broadcast time has doubled by more than 1.05 million to CNN and almost tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to the Nielsen agency and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC increased the follow-up on cable TV to 3.5 million following the main night news.
"It's the heat people love, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designated Survivor" series on the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovellová, an experienced comedy author and series "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls his taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to choose Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because he's funny with him," Mrs. Scovellov told me.
It's the importance of having fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story playing in of Washington could predict the future of Roe V. Wada, whether the immigrant families can re-connect and benefit from the global economy.
Exhaustion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged followers.
And yet it's about whether you're an informed citizen when you're watching a panel of experts for six hours, who are discussing how Bob Woodward is using the "deep storage" resources for his book Fair, destroying Paul Manafort's leather jacket at $15,000 ("agreement" as indicated by Washington Post) and the consequences of Mr. Trump Stormy Daniels' anatomy.

Money outside is running into the narrowest domestic elections of the mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania, following the financial flow, was reorganized by the Congressional Districts, which generated two office holders in the fight against the same chair.
This has recently led to the conversion of the Pittsburgh suburban regional democratic Republic of Conor Lamb – which won another district in a special election last year in spring.
Lamb stands against another office holder, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily covered with a new 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued its opinion in January that the old districts were undistributed in the interests of the Republicans, maps were crossed.
In the new 17th district, the competition began with a sharp financial gap between the financial lines of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair was occupied by the Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Policy experts are giving the Democrats a slight leap.
America is considering punishing Salvador for China's support, then retreating
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was housed in a hotel in Panama until the partners were court-appointed by the Trump organizational team.
Representatives of the foreign ministries decided to withdraw US diplomatic mission directors from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions do not further know Taiwan," spokesperson Heather Nauertová said in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
But suffering was considered only against Salvador, which received an estimate of US$ 140 million in 2017, including drugs control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included short-term financial assistance and aimed at limiting visas, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With continuing internal negotiations, North American and Central American representatives have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity related to similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, the chief executives explained that they want to continue in the negotiations and effectively complete any penalties considered for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the solution of the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, under the signal that the administration is putting in place at the conference, the diplomats introduced.
And three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having any new unresolved news from Washington.
The spokesperson for the White House Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed with the debate on internal negotiations on terms of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government executive and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The report by Robert Mueller of the Special Commission on the possible protection of Mr Trump from the exercise of the right now contained in the public records of many evidence could be a definitive scratch to cancer.
Mr. Mueller reportedly turned to whether Mr. Trump's campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there were any exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to apply for responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to re-present himself before the electorate, and finally the jury of his colleagues would have waited for him.
This is a whole series of 'if', and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice in front of us, which will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to set up a bridge against Hitler, just enough to establish and support the Western powers in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of full bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the impenetrable pace of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical times.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump throws out the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who's driving the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been pushing it ever since the report announced that he had secretly proposed to record the president last year and speculated that he was not in a state of health so that he could stop the president's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh will not be complete or fair – or what if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite a convincing charge of sexual assault and guilty statements?
And what's most important is that we're going to vote in the mid-term for Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait for a long dark night.
But I believe that we are not successful, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and about 60 years later, she sent me on a Saturday to light candles at a table with a sink.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about encountering Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday host Rapid Vienna, aware that victory over Rakušana would give them a great deal of hope for the European League Group's action after an impressive remise in Spain on the Villarreal field earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from appearing on the field for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Villarreale. However, he believes that Rangers can use this result as a reflection bridge for larger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal has a quality team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with the faith that we could do something, and we drove a point.
We might have been able to multiply it in the end, but the remise was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we improved and we were better.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard because they've played a good match in the last match.
Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club, but now I have a very good feeling about it.
The team is strong, and the guys are really using it. Coach's fine, too.
I hope we get through this right now, we're throwing the last season behind our heads and we're gonna be successful."
Women are worried about saving pensions
Although participants had a clear idea of how they should be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
The crowd of half of the people in the nationwide study reported that their partner had been discussing the price of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said she was talking to her children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't want to talk to him," explains Holly Snyder, Vice-President of State Life Insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you first reveal your wishes to them.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and how to take care of them, because these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Admit your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to earn these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, through traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay these expenses, or through your own insurance using your own funds – while you have money.
Create your legal documents: Ban legal battles as long as possible.
Be appointed as a health care representative, which will be a trusted person who will look after your medical care and ensure that your physicians will comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are not compromised if you are not able to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical attention and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Write down these details in the written plan so that you can be prepared.
"There are not only finances in the game, but, for example, what are the doctors called?" asks Martin.
“Where are the drugs?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready by hand."
The man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from an airplane
When a man came home after nightfall, he was hit by a few shots from an airplane.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST as a "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Pala on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Dongal Regent, which is the area north of Pal, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter of 7,5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal after the outbreak of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Paul and the Regent of Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379 800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when they hit earthquakes and tsunamis.
It is located more than 300 km (180 km) along the coast to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The province's administrative region of Regentia had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
In the province there is also a significant nickel mine, which is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Paul and Dongal have already hit the tsunami several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunamis in Dongale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit West Dongally in 1996, when she applied for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly under earthquakes.
Here is a list of several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries and prepared 226,000 people for life along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: The series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6,8 struck them gradually on the island of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7,5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra and caused tsunamis 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for the lives of about 300 people.
2016: The mild earthquake hit the Regent Pide Jaya in the province of Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where she killed more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Algerian governor and vice-president of Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, reports of domestic violence and arrest.
When the police reportedly tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up her phone.
Palin was sent to Mat-Su Pretral Facility and is held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
According to the network report, he appeared on Saturday at a court of law where he declared himself to be "innocent" when he was asked to make a statement.
Fuel faces three Class A violations, which means that it could be sentenced to a year of deprivation of liberty and to ransom up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was accused of a Class B offence punishing one-day prison and fined 2000 USD.
It's not the first thing that Palin has to face with criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged attack on the police reported his mother, Sarah Palin, on the phone.
The case is currently before the Algerian war veteran court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, reporting domestic violence and holding arms under the influence of misleading substances in connection with the incident.
He must have hit his girlfriend's face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by war veterans when her son’s violent behavior combined with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are out of operation and the numbers of victims are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi, which is located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos appeared showing a moment of doom.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pala, when the tsunamis hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – this is an exceptional penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly launched an attack on the cyclist along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan district using a rented truck Home Depot, which has destroyed pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saipov "intelligently" killed eight victims and "intelligently" caused a number of injuries – this defines the conditions for granting the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to the court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of granting a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including, for example, charges of murder for the benefit of exorcism commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preparation", the plaintiff claims and describes the way Saipov did the act as gross, cruel and twisted."
"Sayful Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadts, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijs, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca," he said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Court of Southern District of New York recently sentenced to death.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, which proved to be a conspiracy for the purpose of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, reported on the basis of court documents during the days and months following the attack of minimal regret.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's accusation, he informed the authorities that he was inspired by the surveillance of videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
The police also reported that they also required the suspension of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he was innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "evidently disappointed" in the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of the admission of guilt and the conviction of life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma from these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The Saip's defense team has already asked the plaintiff not to demand the death penalty.
According to Members, the Conservative Party should be entrusted with the Brexit NIGEL FARAGE negotiations
Nigel Farage committed himself during today's protest at the Conservative Party's conference to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians must "taste pressure" from the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's own Members suggested, he should negotiate with the EU.
The ordinary Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone said on his way to Birmingham that Great Britain would be out now, if he was a secretary to Brexit Mr. Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May is facing in calming her ranks, where there is a deep dissatisfaction, has been highlighted by the conservatives fighting for the EU's conquest, who have joined a stand-alone protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from the Chequers in the course of attacks on Brexit, the Union and the EU itself.
The allies insist that they continue to seek agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and they will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between their package and their 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone announced that the Leave Means Leave group would meet in Solihul where he wanted to "go to the Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were in the front, we'd be out today," he said.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: 'I will become Brexit, but we must jump to the Chequers.'
To show his resistance to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to listen.
In our own country we want to do our own laws."
Mr. Bone has rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that British citizens would change their opinion and want to remain silent is totally late.'
Conservatory of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who also took part in the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
,Checkers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they don't like him from our party members or our activists who are currently filling the streets so that we can be elected.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report for Mrs Mayo, she says, "The Prime Minister will keep his place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that conservative policies need to be "to get into an unpleasant situation" if they want to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're standing here today to tell them that we won't let you."
In the report, he added: 'I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit's expression, to feel pressure.
"Now we are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, who have assured us of victory in the Brexit referendum, and will not rest until we are independent and proud of the Great Britain, who will rule himself."
In the meantime, the Union’s service representatives attended Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had transparency of the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of this party’s operation.
Labour Ambassador Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives about the security problems of the party's application after the conference started.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for problem-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all fresh."
There's nothing like a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to "really think" the presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November elections, "he will think about the presidential candidacy very well".
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at a council in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is trying to re-election November against Republican representative Geoffu Diehl, who was co-chaired by the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It felt at the speculative centre that Trump could be set up in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the council since Trump sat in the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to be appointed president's office.
Warren reported that there was a time when women "to express themselves to Washington and make our government a broken one, which also means a woman in the highest position."
He was arrested suspected of shooting Simse from LSU
Police at Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had detained the suspect from the Friday shooting of the basketball player team LSU Wayd Simse.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dieteon Simpson, at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video from the Friday shooting was issued requesting the identification of a man caught in the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday in early hours near the campus of the University of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered gunshot wounds, which did not meet with life," said police chief Murphy J. Paul via web 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was moving on the scene, had a gun and admitted the shooting of Waydea Simse.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 inches tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, of which 10 were in the last season, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points for the match.
Great price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world's champion when the team leader joined him in victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valteri Bottas finished his qualification on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a major role in the race.
From the field of position Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two turns he broke his position and called Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel went into the depot as the first and let Hamilton get the cars running on the edge of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver went to the depot about the bike later, and after leaving he arranged for Vettel. However, Hamilton stepped out ahead and in a close fight the Ferrari had to leave the internal road unattended so that he could defend himself in the third turn after a double manoeuvre.
Max Verstappen got out of the back row of the field and at the end of the first round he was in charge on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race because he held his original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight wheels he was no longer able to increase the pace and Raikkonen remained the fourth.
It's a hard day because Valteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he was ordered, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the rewards are the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad word.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Feinstein's Saturday meeting because she insisted she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement given to Ford before the Senate's judicial commission, instead stated that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad and stubborn and stubborn."
"One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that is happening in the last days in Senara, when you see that gap, when you see those people being angry and angry and stubborn and lying," he said.
"When you look at the edition and the publication and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diana Feinstein, can you escape for that?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ,uh,uh,what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, that's not," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent Ford's letter with details of the charge against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's call, nor did I publish information about the case," said Colomsia Feinstein, as The Hill informed.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, according to her words, the president, who expressed himself at the Saturday evening meeting, said: “I will tell you that this is a really wrong body language.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway it's the worst word of a body I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court judge, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats were using these charges for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to take back too much of any available means.
You see the subterfuge, the horror, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to get back to the country to get back to power and steering," Mediate's president quoted the words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer twice scored for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars set up Friday's victory in the Elite League against Belfast Giants won a Saturday's retreat in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The giants soon took double lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to get home before Dwyer returned Giants.
Francois Bouchard then compared the two branches of Luke Lundvald Nielsen to their victory.
It was a third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe's team, which succeeded in defeating 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
Both teams met in the season, and all three previous matches were held by Giants.
Dwyer's first branch came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford signed up for Beauvilier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who was comparing at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the cabin for the first stop only in the lead when he recorded his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
Home reassessed and Bouchard again managed to equalize the goal of the overpowering game at 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later helped Nielsen in the match for the first time to break the lead on the side of Dundee and the tennis player assured his team's leadership in half of the final third.
Giants who have now lost the fourth of the last five matches will play another match at Milton Keynes on Friday home.
The air traffic controller died to allow hundreds of people on board the aircraft to avoid earthquakes
The leading air traffic in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died as he watched a plane crash with hundreds of people flying safely on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a massive earthquake caused by the tsunamis struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong ensuing earthquakes engulfed the area, and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Pala.
But although his twenty-one-year-old fellow Anthonyus Gunavana fled to save his life, he refused to leave his seat in the wild with a misdirecting tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained in his position to make sure that the flight of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the run at that time, could safely fly off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, told the Australia ABC News television channel that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a transport helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was transferred to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning he died before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts are broken by this report," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed fears that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management said that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies remain unresolved under slaughter and many of them have not yet been saved," said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, spokesperson.
The waves in the devastated Pala reached altitudes up to six meters. In the city they will have mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft will be brought into the affected areas of aid and delivery.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said at Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in other bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find in place.
It's a tragedy already, but it could be even worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Yoko Widodo came to Palo and told the country’s military components: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks necessary to evacuate.
Are you ready?" CNN introduced.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, killing more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The air carrier, which crashed into a lagoon on one of the micron islands in the Pacific, now stated that one person was missing, at first stating that all passengers and crew of a total of 47 persons safely evacuated from the submerged aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find a traveling man.
The airline stated that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for providing details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the plane got into the water when trying to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials claimed that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline indicated that six passengers remained in the treatment on Saturday and were all in a stable state.
What caused the accident and the exact outcome of the events, however, remains unclear.
The US airlines and the US indicated that the aircraft arrived in the lagoon before the landing route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane was landing at very low altitudes.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he and others managed to get water through the belt deep into the emergency exits of the aircraft.
He further stated that the ship crew panicked and yelled and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that seamen working close to the port mill’s rectifications helped with the rescue of the boat by means of a flotation that was transported by passengers to the shore before the plane sank into a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades, aircraft with a total of 111 passengers were killed in an aircraft crash, but no accident happened to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The complaint ended on Saturday in this case in which a man is repeatedly sentenced to a woman's incarceration in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice in his analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert judgements in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury planned a script using the phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had obtained localized data from several mobile phones that showed that Telllis was on the night of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, wrote The Clarion Ledger.
When it was found that he spent the night with Chambers on the mobile phone, he found out that he was with his friend Michael Sanford and then visited the police.
Sanford stood in front of the courthouse and proved that the day in question was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was “lied because my car was in Nashville that night.”
Another accident was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he reduced the text messages of Chambers, calling and contact information from his phone.
"He totally wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge indicated that he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip Hop Trio wants to deal with negative views on this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed Chapel from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
That's why they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently met with the resurrection due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black girl?
The New Yorker complains about his release after a "racist" text message
The New Yorker complains a few of her discriminatory rejections after receiving the wrong text message from the mother, where it was marked as the "more black" text message.
A few refused to be racist and compared the complaint with the "exposure".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when on the first day of work in 2016 she found that the new educator of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NOEEÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÈÉÍÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÍÉÉÉÉÉÍČČÉČÉČÉČÉ ČNOČÉÉÉÉ,” P. Plasco-Faxman wrote to her husband in the
However, instead of sending her husband twice, she sent her to the Maurice.
When she understood her fake passport, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman threw Mrs. Maurice out and said that she was just leaving the nurse who was an African-American who was working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, she introduced a letter from New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice complains about compensation for leaving work and asks for a compensation of USD 350 per day of the six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not happening," Post said this Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination".
However, the two returned with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate step because they feared that they could no longer believe her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are no racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco, in the Post.
"But would you place your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even though it was wrong?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened the complaint to "striking" and stated that his wife was only caring for an old child for two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you like to drive for someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Even though the judiciary is still going on, the jury on social media quickly judged the two of them for their behavior and logic.
The storytellers about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not be compatible with the talking bear, the latest reports show.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, told the reporter: “It is difficult to feel the situation of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun to know now that we already know the huge success of the Spider Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write a baby's book about a little spider bear, was very disappointed that his work had been refused, added on the 60th anniversary of publication of the book that became a "sweet" point after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family”, she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a completely quiet man, he was never so ingenious," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was as if you had a child who achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in this respect.
Even though it was only his creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his success to Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transferred to Louise Pasteura 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me that it was really wrong and that he didn't expect to get out of it," said Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I should have called from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart on the move slowly lost her effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait. I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving the loss of her daughter, entered the plane together with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test is just going on.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head shut, all the time running through my tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the summer when I felt a wonderful understanding for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Saddening women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are spreading the views of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, died in 18 years.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said her son was given a young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could brighten every room."
However, he left work before his death because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the unmovable body of his relatives after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m still afraid of what this will have to do with his life. ”
Mrs. Davis suggested the illustration, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help them and who can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Don't sit shut - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies' flying girlfriend, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling at the bottom, or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst thing on Christmas Day – when the children opened the presents, and he didn't look at them, nothing."
She said that her partner’s death was a huge trauma to them, but that she had to get through it gradually: “This can be done with a complete hole in the family.
It broke us.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI starts its investigation
"I thought we could get something that we actually asked for – research in time of limitation, with a limited extent – we could bring some unity into it," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "fall apart" because both sides would be buried after the partisan.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
Elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us on 6 November, and if Republicans behave as expected, this will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to get the man demanded by them to post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, praised them for supporting Mr. Kavanaugh who worked in the White House for President Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI gets his message?
The Senate will vote on this and there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear, however, whether Mr. Kavanaugh in the Senate can receive at least 50 votes, which has enabled Vice-President Mike Pence to break through and confirm at the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea to Kim "decreased"
The numbers of refugees from North to South Korea have declined since the beginning of the Kim Chong-Una government seven years ago, says the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Union Ministry, said that in the last year there were 1127 refugees – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further pointed out that there are more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of required border passports.
Phjongang has not issued any public statements.
The vast majority of refugees from the North today receive an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Soul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with North Korea's longest border and are easier to cross than in a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between the North and the South – which are still technically in war - has improved considerably in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Phjongang for talks that focused on a halted denuclearization.
This resulted in a historic June meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on the broad terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of failing to make any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can afford to defend ourselves unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosiová called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said that due to his temperament he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help myself, but if any woman had conducted such a theatre, they would call it "hysterical," Pelosi said in his reaction to Kavanaugh a quarterly statement before the Senate judicial commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both still in puberty.
In his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating when discussing his family and his years at high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and stated that their accusations against him were "big and coordinated" organised liberals who could not pass through the loss of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he himself has been disqualified by these statements and by the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosís replied in opposition to the question whether she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats received most of the representatives in the Snow House.
“I will tell you this – if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also at the court where he works now,” Pelosís said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court appeal.
Pelosís added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the potential benefits of Kavanaugh in court under the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade because it is considered a conservative judge.
In the context of hearings prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh ignored the answer to the question whether he would reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no time for a hysterical, pretended person to go to court and expect us to just say "Jee, that's beautiful," said Pelosi.
And women have to control it.
After verbal accidents, months, and years of shelter, she was unable to get rid of it without crying.
"We're crying when we're out," Mrs. Steinem told me about 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “I was helped by a woman who was working with a director and who told me that she was also crying when she had an abortion, but she created a certain technique, which means that when she had an abortion and started to cry, she said to the person who spoke to her: ‘ Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm out of my mind."
And that's how she kept on doing it.
And I think that's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job where I worked in a man-dominated office. I once expressed my indescribable longing for crying, but the older man, always the cold manager, who was always a little scared, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never tell them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you have a temper.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in a non-marriage affair on board the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said with laughter after 30 years.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Puppets."
Since the campaign has been running for a long time, it has not been able to take a step towards obtaining contributions and has thus committed itself not to going into the fight unless it achieves $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give it $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported it, frustration with the system that made it difficult to obtain money and focus on the electorate rather than on the delegates and from the distance over sexism that she was completely choking away.
"You might think I was nervous," said Mrs. Schroeder about how she responded to the press.
“And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking about what they might write me on the tombstone.
"Weeping"?"
Why can the Chinese-American trade war be good for Beijing
The initial war of trade between the United States and China was overwhelming, and even though the battle is not far off, according to experts, the gap between countries has long been beneficial to Beijing.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, gave the first warning this year by announcing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week when new tariffs were announced for goods of USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), which basically means taxing half of Chinese exports to the USA.
Beijing has always responded, with the most recent tariff reduction of between five and ten percent of the US’s 60 billion imports.
China has tried to pay the United States the same coin, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would kneel in its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original rails, it would mean meeting his demands, but public scrutiny of the American requirements would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si china-pching.
However, experts believe that if Beijing was able to play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The fact is that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would lead to economic distortion in both countries, which is much more dangerous than observers have allowed so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research workshop focusing on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country that was devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into a normal state.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are now met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million people since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moual stated that the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that we should not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe gave a clear response to the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field on the edge of the difficulty in France.
The U.S. has now lost its sixth on European soil, so it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn with his team reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The United States star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then fired the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 holes and let Francesco Molinari win.
The Italian golfer Molinari then starred in all his wheels and became one of 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 European team players with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Most rated world player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who carefully graduated his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points earned for his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help today.
It was a tough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He gave a cup to his countryman John Ramp, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride that I beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," said 23 years old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now scored a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend trying to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a peak golf course throughout the tournament.
“ I’m really proud of those guys, ” said Captain Jim Furyk after his team’s unsatisfying results.
This morning we really warmed up Europe.
We really couldn't handle it.
I'm taking a hat off Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players really played very well.
We will move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I like those 12 guys. I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to take a nap.
You've lost us."
Update on the Red River: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by Commission Florida Fish and Wildlife points to the overall decline in the concentration of red tides in the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, the boiling water is now reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier periods – this indicates a lowering concentration.

The wrecks were observed about 10 miles from the coast during the Hillsborough period, but last week it was already relatively less.
The red feed was also observed in the period Pasco.
Last week average concentrations were reported at the coast or on the free sea at Pinellas. During the Hillsborough period, low to high concentrations were observed, lowest to high concentrations in Manatee, lowest to high concentrations at the coast or at the free sea at Sarasota, lowest to medium concentrations in Charlotte, lowest to high concentrations at the coast or at the free sea at Lee and low concentrations in Collier.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier periods.
