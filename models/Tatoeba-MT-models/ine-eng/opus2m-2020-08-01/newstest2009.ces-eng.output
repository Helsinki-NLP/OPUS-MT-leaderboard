The Prague Stock Exchange went down to the minus at the end of the trade
After the early fall, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the ordinary daily trade.
From the start of Tuesday's trade, the Prague Stock Exchange has been on its Monday's decline when it has dropped by almost six percent.
This time, there's a loss of action on Wall Street.
We also see the market's reaction to the result of the vote by the American House of Representatives who refused to support the plan for stabilization of the dark financial sector.
The fall in shares in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stock market shares in Asia, even though the indexes finally lost some of them during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index recorded nearly four percent during the trade, but later part of the loss decreased and decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8%, in Shanghai markets were closed.
Stocks at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock exchange has dropped by 3.6 per cent according to the dark index.
"The timing of a rescue action in the United States is inconceivable and affects financial markets around the world," said the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, decides its monetary policy on its own, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
The rate of interest is Hong Kong at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, US legislators should quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, he threatens to feel the effects of other countries.
Bloody pool of American shares
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the financial support plan for up to $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 billion).
The legislators have thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
The U.S. stock had a bloodbath on Monday and the main stock indices recorded the largest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent and a similar decline occurred last year in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the House did not pass, the index felt free.
Congressional: The U.S. government can pump $700 billion to the bank
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed to a broader format of the agreement on financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
We'll vote on him next week.
The US legislators made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial aid for the US financial system amounting to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
But it hasn't been won yet.
Congressmen must complete certain details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the ground of the House of Representatives on Monday.
This is what Reuters, president of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, said on Sunday.
In the Senate, according to sources, the plan could probably be voted on first Wednesday.
According to economists, the adoption of the rescue plan should be announced as the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets to achieve in practice also leads to "intervention".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how the package should look like to stabilise the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be on Sunday.
Lawmakers' representatives met on Sunday with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations non-selling mortgage assets that bring financial firms into serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a final agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
It's still important to continue in the recovery plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are rapidly declining.
According to Nevado democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where Congress's decision could affect Monday trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor will they be able to tie the negotiations to some problem for the last minute.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, still recognizes a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
Congress may, however, block the release of the remaining amounts if it feels that the programme is not fulfilling its function, following another $100 billion and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed progress in negotiations
The President may vote in favour of this decision, but the Congress may vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which has been financed to buy off bad mortgage securities, which has lost its value because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay off their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
Photographic representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the federal effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold drops
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the head of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, closure of deposits, timely financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit so-called “golden fees” for directors of participating companies and to set up a committee to supervise the fund.
He should run the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of homeowners who have problems with pay.
The government should negotiate new payments at the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of payments to debtors and allow them to leave their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan, according to the main economist Patria Finance David Mark, is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to realize.
"And that's because you don't know what mechanism and what price problem assets will be bought.
This will determine how the financial sector and government will share losses among themselves," said the iHNed.cz Marek server this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, it's not as important as Mark's.
"It is much more important for Congressmen to agree this week that they support this plan and that it will be dedicated as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is now the most important thing," Marek stressed.
Fight for sharp knives: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll figure out how to choose.
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
That makes it clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
There are, however, plenty of reasons for a person to set up a solo player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use and the demands of the future owner.
You may find it hard to get home a top-end gramophone to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
However, such music products on the LP boards do not come from a qualitative point of view and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you feel pressured in your regalia to vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone at least.
It is the same with music on the way, that is, music compressed, simply - music in MP3.
There are also price and qualitative categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to lose eight thousand crowns for a player, as well as a Pink Floyd fan, probably a hard-testing earphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Also decides battery power
Some peak music players manage much more than just playing music, but what most phones don't happen.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone calls and essays, he can play music and video, both record, have better, worse camera and maybe he can also navigate.
And if we take in smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, but no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
The universality of the cell also brings disadvantages.
The more you use your cell phone functions, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the pen.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy rats.
A little cell phone can play music for more than ten hours, most of it is much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more efficient.
For cheap phones, count with them that they won't play you for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and you're calling there, get yourself into work for the security of another pen - it also pays for more expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, and the worst will last for at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one round.
Another problem arises when recording music in a cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, and in addition, not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a few cards can be played without discounting with miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
You don't need any special software for players up to the exception (iPod).
Just fill in the music via USB from the computer.
Most phones and players are already creating a music library sorted by the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the need to evaluate the user.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories like the Windows Explorer and some are both capable (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
The players serve the strings, the phones are more capable
When selecting a specific device, take particular care of battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and of course also of the comfort of control.
If your music is mainly music and if you listen to it every day only briefly in the tramway, you will have enough of any cell that wins the MP3.
Which can really do almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much of what musical formats a mobile or a player can do.
The MP3 will manage all and the absolute majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and apart from it, the complete majority of the devices can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also enable for example to buy online music.
It is enough through mobile Internet to visit the operator's website (or other provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a fall-back argument for establishing a music cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and limits most of the time to the speedy radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will be controlled by the music industry in the future.
Most people's mobiles are still carrying them.
Whenever you get a taste of listening, you put your cell phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is lying at home.
However, it still depends whether you are always wearing a earring or at least a wire handlefree.
If not, you can use an integrated player who has almost every mobile but only a minimum MP3 player.
It'll probably be the biggest advantage of music phones for a lot of prices.
The cheapest is usually under three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you'll have a very decent walkman.
Most of you will, however, limit the absence of a normal ear.
The best and most equipped phones on the technical side even with a 3.5 mm wall for the usual earphones are worth fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can really control everyone.
The minimum function, the similarity of control with the previous usual case or the need for a gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of a faulty mobile Internet and consequently a huge data transfer account.
What device to reach
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots on exchange cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
You can also enter two thousand crowns by buying the card.
Be careful, though.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy another cheap MP3 player, please contact the Crown, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irivera.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to lose more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you should be more interested in specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have a separate control button for MP3 and the comfort of the service is so close to the individual MP3 player.
Next, it is in Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the walkman series have identical user interfaces as a sold-in MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and will support the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above marks.
The first virtual operator will be arriving in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here -- a virtual operator that would make the classics do it.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that the Czech operators are even the most expensive in Europe, we've written on Mobil.cz many times.
Finally, he also confirmed that the cost of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming charges regulation, this may lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic be kept so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competition that would really want to get into battle.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and penetrations over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to enjoy the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CHTÚ) Paul Dvořák, who said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network is not too likely to have too much chance (at least it would be hard to find the frequency).
But there is another option - virtual operator.
It was just the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant price reductions, which the classical operators had to respond to.
However, even before the entry of a stick such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, they sounded similar voices in Britain as we do in the United Kingdom.
But it turns out it's a place for such operators and they can be really successful.
The rest of us don't have to walk too far for examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator.
However, Mobilking is behind the Penta financial group, which owns, among other things, U:phones in the Czech Republic.
The benefit of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they have much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world such virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost operators - offering cheap calls and text messages, which is often balanced by a more expensive service offer.
So Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half the price than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good stretch and bet on an unspoilt target group.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"Administrative men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that in Poland could catch us.
Vodafon's press spokesman Miroslav Čepíký has doubts about this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations do not seem too hopeful in the Czech Republic.
More is going to be released to Mobilking in other countries of our region," Jana Studničová, the Penta financial group’s press spokesman, said in a phone conversation.
In fact, it has confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
Rather, he is trying to do everything in his power to prevent any potential competitor from getting up.
For a longer time, the GTS Novera group has not been in the interest of launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 Telephonics in the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already made progress in negotiations," says the press spokesman of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe it's getting brighter at better times.
Unofficial information suggests that we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, his creation has been linked to an impenetrable building of silence.
"At this point, we do not think that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no entity with a complex and serious project in this area has addressed us," Vlastimil Sršeň of the O2 Press Committee stated in his statement to Mobil.cz
Other operators shall also apply to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobil Martin Kemrová’s press speaker adds in a rare way to the O2: “We have therefore not recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project that could be built on.”
And he adds, "In the T-Mobile network, it's hard to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone prefers to pay attention to the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepýký says about this: "We are open with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the most advantageous from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to price reductions and thus to a reduction in their profits.
Why, then, should we make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when there's something going on with the operators, they'll bring them in for one wire, and they'll testify to the tahanica around the U:phone.
Probably the greatest pressure towards CTU went at the time of the creation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
It bears witness to this publicly available information from the website.
Now, however, U:phone is being used as an argument why virtual operator should not be allowed.
Martina Kemr's point was: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the PRC, it is obvious that another player's entry to it and, above all, his services would be subject to high requirements."
In view of this approach by mobile operators, however, the Czech regulatory authorities are directly insinuating the full interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
However, it is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - that has no power to compete in economic competition.
They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But he took his typical stand on the whole issue.
"The entry into the mobile market of a virtual operator would be possible after a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure has been concluded.
No such contract has yet been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa of the UOHS External Relations Committee in answer to our question.
It is unlikely that the expression thus formulated from the operators' representatives will be surprising.
From an office that is supposed to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market, it is more than a respected one.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually operate, we can see that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the undercutting of prices is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In fact, the shock of the whole case is the close binding of three mobile operators that come from their reactions.
The question is whether it's really just an accident, it's offered entirely by itself.
Just like the exact same price of petrol at pump stations, it is certainly only by chance and a hard competition struggle.
"The Authority in this matter did not look for signs of anti-competitive conduct, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so they do not have adequate responsibility for their market negotiations.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to also meet the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
Interpreting a dominant position on the market is one of many issues.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by CTU, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of competition.
Of course, then, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of network operators.
And the mobile operator -- he's totally logical -- on his network monopoly.
So in a certain segment, it must be dominant.
However, even if we do not allow this argument, for UOHS it should be minimally warning that three mobile operators are acting in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of a number of stakeholders (including GTS Novera) indicate that all operators face very similar obstacles when dealing with them.
Responsibility to the TEU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the UOHS gives away from the whole matter.
We've met with him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, to a recent adoption of a new telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of the TEU to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to proceed, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The UOHS representatives must know more than well, but their interests are probably elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one sees.
However, there is no mention of the functioning of any pseudovirtual operators that exist in Czech mobile networks right now.
They are companies that issue their own prices for mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
It's usually about a company that deals with multi-level marketing.
This is how your own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The art is that the company appears to the operator as a classic customer who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As an important customer, then, you will get special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If the cases you are talking about were to arise, they could be breaching the contractual terms that we would deal with and might be able to end our cooperation with the company," said Martin Kemr.
It is unlikely, however, that a similar activity would not be carried out by responsible mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
However, none of the operators shall be prevented from doing so.
The activities of these companies have indispensable profits and, unlike actual virtual operators, they are no threat to their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýký points out the possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not on their behalf, so they cannot have access to it as normal mobile operators."
That's exactly what should be at least weird.
In addition, another question for ÚOHS will be opened.
If mobile operators turn their eyes over a similar procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to detect a similar activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with explaining to operators that they have no such idea and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As the text has fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a marked decline in prices for services.
In practically all countries where virtual operators were born, however, classical operators tried to defend their existence more or less.
Their arguments were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with service quality, etc.
In developed countries, but right now, regulatory authorities have been affected, not by the interests of mobile operators, but by their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and the others were caught up in it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are going through the whole case as hot potatoes.
From our experience, we cannot escape the realization that in these cases, they are more than qualified to do so.
But let's not put flint in the grain.
If background information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has allowed the emergence of a virtual mobile operator, it will only be difficult for ÚOHS to remain ineffective to refuse (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we need to stop calling the dreary than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymna has four new versions.
Select the best here
Listen to the four implementations of the new version of the Czech State Gym.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek officially presented new recordings of the State Hyme at my home on the occasion of the Czech State Day.
Hymnu recently recorded the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bélohlávka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo songs, in congregational administration and instrumentation.
The song was sung by Katerina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the reform of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krkek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The whitehead considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He told the Czech public earlier that he had deliberately chosen to sing solos with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular.
"From the beginning, I was at both and then with the congregation trying to make sure that they had a clear dictum, so that the text would be understood well, so that they could be condemned," he said.
The Czech state hymen will celebrate 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home was sung for the first time in 1834 on the tracks of the Stavovské theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Josef Kayetán Tyla added by Františč Škroup.
She gained popularity, and people took her as their own.
The first song then became a natural part of the state hymn after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
How's "new" hymna?
Prague MDD on the middle of the first link and on the chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will be in the pocket of an electronic coupon.
This one can now arrange about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (that will be paid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time keep on record on their digital card in the info centres and workshops of the Transport Company in the stations of the Museum, Bridge, Nadraží Holesovice, Angel, Roztyly, Lettnyany, Kobylisy, Rajská garden, Kačerov and Luka.
Gifts can also be purchased from yesterday on the Transport Company website www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet store can definitely forget about the front window in the subway stations, where they have to regularly stand on long fronts on paper carts.
The coupon is bought online and recorded on an Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places there is a passenger crossing with a trained service that will help interested people with online shopping and also record on their card a coupon purchased," said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to the books, it will be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines that are mounted in several vestibules of meters.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they remind of the riders and the travelers may have noticed them at the stations of Roztyly, Budjejovicka, I. P. Pavlov, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year they should be eighty," the Guardian added.
coupon checks the location of the driver
The machine service that starts tomorrow is simple.
It is enough to insert an Opencard chip card and a previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are payable not only in the main city, but also in its surroundings.
This means in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, where they drive to the main city mainly residents of medieval towns.
"In trains included in Prague's integrated transport, the guides are equipped with cart readings to determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid, which establishes the traffic rules of Prague's collective transport.
Municipal buses have read cards built in the treasure at the driver's.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the driver a chip card at the time of the show, but also to add an Opencard to a specific location on the side of the treasure.
The driver shall verify the validity of the coupons recorded.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the coupons recorded, it is not easier than to ask drivers for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who don't go by bus and don't remember when their coupon expires can go back to self-service machines where coupons are recorded on the card.
They shall display information on the validity of their documents on the display.
The judges wanted a U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Germans applied to join the United States of America.
It comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South American scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the patronage of the United States.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudets turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
It comes from, among other things, a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South American scientific library.
The Czech Krumlov Germans ask in a letter from the US President not to allow the return of the "Shuma" - banned by Hitler under the Manich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and we really want to be sure that American units come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed by the words "People who are in the heart of the forest."
Because the accession to Czechoslovakia gives allegedly to the Sudanese Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only of brutality, ignorance, ignorance, pressure and slavery, the authors of a letter from the US President asking him to take over the protection of the present and eternal times.
"We can't believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would admit this territory to some foreign state that impresses us and expels minorities and nothing, even contributing nothing to the victory of the United States," the letter says.
The reason why authors can't sign is apparently the fear of the revenge of the Czech oppressors.
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the forest parish on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s wartime knowledge, some historians suggest that the expectation of the Sudanese Germans is well exacerbated.
Although the Germans had to at least think that they would withdraw from the Republic, only a few of them allowed such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate certain types of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others believed they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Budjejovices.
He was in the war like a Buddhist German who was involved in the Baltic Navy.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and put him in a prison camp in Holštínsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would have a Czech throw," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that they would withdraw from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't mean - you'll pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action aimed at road safety in Czech history.
It would also be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign that it intends to launch in the middle of the ministry of transport.
The Office of Minister Aleše Ribíčka promises to remove drivers from the dangerous behaviour of the steering wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on flights.
She should get her drivers off the fast drive and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to join them before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And it also bears witness to the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't mean - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in large letters on the magazine.
And then in the bloodstream, the word "you'll pay."
It should symbolize that a person can pay his own life in a moment of neglect.
The spectators will be "fearing" meetings until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in England, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents can usually be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead on Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and chicken on the driver
"The driver pays for the sugar and butter system.
Sugar for them is that if they go to red for example, it saves time.
The Battle is a threat to suffering or to accidents.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist at the hospital at Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and especially negative advertising, my psychologist.
He said that less effective are the tables that alert drivers to danger.
"If a static table is installed to protect against danger, it is likely that it will soon collapse with the environment and the drivers will not devote themselves to it," the Korean said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the temporary Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in the interview that the newspaper Jediot Acronot published on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, unless at all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to lower a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He assumed that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an attack on two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places", which lies within the Old City.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he added.
Departure from Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke for Israel's departure from the Golan heights, which he considered to be an unimaginable condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of departure from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians well know what they will have to give up to win the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship to Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to (Shit movement) Hizballáh; they will have to give up the permanent support they provide to terrorism (Shit movement) Hamas, Al-Qaeda (Terrorist Network) and Jihad (Holy Wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law is unknown, walking on a remote bus can't be
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, a question arose as to whether Stewards and passengers could travel by bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, Steward's activity is in opposition to the road traffic law," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
An accident that killed a 20-year-old steward last week apparently caused a truck driver who crossed the road.
The girl at the time of the accident was sitting next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats to spare.
However, the bus can crash, or quickly freeze, even at a time when the Stewart broadcasts coffee or newspapers.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with a parking space according to the technical certificate.
If it is not approved on the bus, the passenger must sit.
Remote buses Student agencies have no place to stay; which is what Radim Jancura, director of the company, has confirmed.
"This was done with the ministry and the movement of passengers was not allowed.
Afterwards, we withdrew and we reached the point that passengers may be allowed to drive to the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The law of Steward doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewards - no legal provisions do so.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the vehicle; its rights and obligations do not define it," Hanzelka says less clearly.
On the contrary, the Director of the Road Traffic Management Committee of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorý believes that the problem of the law is sufficiently addressed.
"It depends if the bus has an approved parking space in the approval.
That's what it ends with," he says.
Buses are divided into cities where there are parking places and limited maximum speed, interurban with parking places with higher permitted speed and remote without parking places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stewards on the bus deck does not see the main problem.
"When the gas ride is dangerous, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
It's not even safe here when turbulence comes and the plane can fall into the head."
"If, however, the bus would rush quickly, of course, physical laws apply.
Just like the city bus or the tram.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by the transporter by internal regulations," he says, and also by virtue of the law, the problem is unresolved.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
A student of the Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The Director does not consider their credentials to be a risk even after the accident.
"But as soon as I realize it's the calling of stewards at risk, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers at the show.
It would save costs," he says.
As an interest in security, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars by Director Alexey Litvin of Asia, who operates a break of lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have stewards, we've been standing against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end some deadly damage," he said a few years ago for the Week.cz.
A Tragedy Improper
In the accident of a link connection to Naples, a young steward from Plzeňska died, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck is likely to turn off without using the direction from the remote track and block the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a quick manoeuvre, but he took on the right front.
That it would be sold out two seats reserved for the steward's rest, Janchura refuses.
"This place can't be booked by remote connections, they're blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck drivers.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the court's Ortel, but the financial compensation is also expected from the defendant.
The law's amendment?
Inadmissible
The clarification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could bring about the amendment of the law to which a 30-year expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working over the year.
"No concrete conclusion has yet to come.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather point system, maximum road speed and mobile use when driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be something that would in principle endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes with the fact that the security of buses is under the authority of the police and the employment security authorities.
Hope Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
In the letter of the WestLB delegation, the employees of this bank are not missing.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial group's institutions are eligible for trade in capital markets," we will refer to in a letter that was received to the public on Monday.
WestLB shall enter in this transaction a "set of competences" that ensures a long-term yield.
In fact, such a link can be a decisive incentive for further mergers in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when a representation wants to prove its ability to act during a difficult period of time.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Spolkov Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the Government of North Pomerania-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The connection between the Deka-Bank, which customers are familiar with for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talking for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The chief of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting the half-yearly results of the operation at the end of August, heard that in the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with some of the country's banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not make sense.
However, the Deca-Bank Board, which is composed of one half of the country's bank and a partner from the other, entrusted the representation with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be business on the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have just begun, and the finance is being undermined.
The Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employees in the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3000 employees, is not the first to talk about consolidation in the brokering sector.
In 2003, it appeared that it could be merged with Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rhineland-Pfalz and Helaba.
There was no end to this three-piece.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessen Land Government expressed itself against the participation of Helaba.
Not even the rest of the bankhouses joined in.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead received Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Even so, speculations about the connection of Deka-Bank with the Land Banks have been repeated.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Helab Bank’s representative, expressed negative feelings about speculation about the connection of his financial house with others.
However, it seems that regardless of this, it appears that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the country’s snow in Bavaria, it could be the first time the BayernLB connects with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not exactly good news for Helab.
If the pressure should rise to another merger, it is gradually becoming possible to establish partners for such a merger.
In the south, only the second hubs would play even though the financial crisis has so far faced significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association with WestLB again banned the Hessen-Thüringen Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 50% share in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
That's what North LB would look like.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions together are.
In June Merl stated that the decisive issue which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of domestic banks, the German Association of Spouse Banks and the jury banks had not yet answered.
Everything could also end with a WestLB distribution, which of course no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter of the Dark Representation also mentions that they are trying to "complex solutions" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it can be connected to connecting individual files to the Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend with Italy"
It's for Elena first, for Lucus third or fourth.
But this time Elena will be like his girlfriend, and then everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre court of the Kaiser brand, there is a stronger swing and two hundred tourists at the October festival prove how deep tones can lift his throat.
Elena Lucu's gonna pop first and then she'll kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus park next to the Porta Nuova station, four buses leave this evening at 23.45 with the name "destinazione Monaco, Festa della brewa", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mostly Italian, in one bus they go exclusively to Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And so on and so on, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Mark, who's got a long coat of leather and glasses with large silver rings, the three buses are.
He's been with them for five years at the October party, only this year he's got three trips.
In the night there, through the day between bars and beer, at 22.30 a.m. return.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The road is worth 75 euros, including a welcome drink with Kaiser beer, which is cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, health insurance and German speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses leave in the night, after the bus route to Brenner.
Beer doesn't give up, not yet.
The bus shuts up, the passenger sleeps.
They're doing well. They're gonna need their powers.
It is built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where there is another stop on the 8th track before Munich and many other buses with the Italian flag.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese in the middle of the seventh morning, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has his last speech, explains the attack plan.
First: Put on a yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to Marc's Internet address travel office: "conscersiviagando.it".
Second, "When the door is opened to the beer stand, run away!" Marco calls to the morning air.
"Go!" Go and put places in the back of the stand.
"Not in front of you, not in front of you, not in front of all the yellow caps on the same side, move around the space!"
My husband's worth 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the split.
"Show the security guys that we're doing the right thing.
Once you leave your places, they're gone."
And third, "Today is exactly half the 11th of the night, so be here again!"
And wake up to Wiesn, a room with beer states.
One member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, cedars and even on the election poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to get ready for the retreat.
As a weekend with Italy, I know the second weekend of October.
Accurate information on the number of visitors is not available; it is about fifty thousand of those who are on their way through the Alps and fall into beer states, ten percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this weekend.
A number of Munich police are sending out seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers are supporting the Bavarian Red Cross, which runs national statistics in which Italians before Britain (approximately 60 attacks) and Rakušany (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
He is particularly popular with the Italian state of Hofbreu.
Dauntless Nights for Believers Hypo Real Estate
Even last week, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has also been involved in its claim that the German banking sector will not remain in crisis development.
Because it was the last weekend.
Indexe Dax, a financial house specialising in the financing of the real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive several billion loans from the German bank consortium to protect against market turbulence.
The person notified of the situation on Monday told Reuters that the said loan aid would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The fees will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually exhausted.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to the news report, this state financial officer has re-financed the long-term projects on which he lent money in an extremely short period of time, which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve dropped by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and slightly decreased the share of equity from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current profit and net profit from financial transactions against last year fell to zero, profits from the increased value of claims and from certain securities, and from the cancellation of credit trade reserves fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Due to the higher profits of the subsequent accounting costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the interest rate in accordance with the tax order and by means of trade for the companies concerned, the sixteen per cent reduction on the part of the profits was still moderated.
The former state financier, after his privatisation in 1990, burned himself on mortgages for lifeboats, which were then removed from the portfolio of services and then led by Aareal Bank.
As classical state funding made too little progress, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private investors and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write down something and these deductions will have "essential material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the whole group, as some have let themselves be heard.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
By 2007, it had been reduced by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has since taken over Depfa as a major financial partner in state and infrastructure projects.
More strongly than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because they do not have any deposits from customers.
After the fall of the U.S. investment bank, Lehman Brothers practically broke out of interbank loans two weeks ago, because banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing for part of the Depfa credit portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this credit for the relevant period and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets at the moment to a significant extent of disability".
Other sources were heard that these funds provided refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets at the time.
The Group Bank and the Group’s Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured on the market.
That's what the shareholders and the bank's creditors are hoping for.
But in view of the dynamics and incompetence of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be exhausted.
But it can't be ruled out.
After the bank is late Sunday afternoon, according to everything that stood before the insolvency, it can't be premature, saved by passion.
The stock exchange fell by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, bonds were well held.
While the preferential debts have not practically been moved, the price of secondary bonds is lost more significantly.
This concerns, in particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and the logical bonds with the period of validity after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bond initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood in terms of stability of the international financial system, after a marked upheaval of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that introduced it into the company by taking over Depfa.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the value of the securities at their maturity.
But it can also come to what almost no one is currently losing hope - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports that are coming at the same time as this partial settlement, only legitimate expectations have now become more likely to border with certainty.
This is especially true of long - term believers who are likely to prepare a series of awake nights when they will decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors may use a margin of at least the fact that they will generate a transfer of losses from the previous accounting periods to the future interest on capital gains for the purposes of future payment of the tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When the sixteen-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop's first day of high school in Tacibana, girls start to cheer up: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mang.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been pushed from my way to school.
I live in the country of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the centre of Tacibana.
I had to find my way alone. Lucky I didn't get lost.
It doesn't seem that the beginning of the training in Tacibana is not given as hard as at our home in Lower Saska.
Students start meeting at eight o'clock, and twenty minutes before the ninth, they start a short session with a teacher, i.e. 'home room'.
But before I started studying, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to talk to people, but 40 students in front of class.
Because I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've taken on the old dress of my host mother, to this blouse, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the fence and tried to say everything right: 'Saïnara Wo still Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany, and I have my birthday this week.
At the time, I was very happy to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, chichotal and had, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my manganese.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I got in my seat fast.
The girl next to me laughed a lot, thought she was honored to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was relatively quiet, but when he called the gang, I was literally asleep.
They spoke through each other and chichotaled and asked me if I could possibly not - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then all of them packed their bags about the break.
My host mother also made me a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German candles.
I had rice with herbs, small beers, peanut salad and rice, fruit and some kind of fish in the tofu pastry.
Most people don't even know what's right here in Japan.
These things look special and they taste quite new.
Of course, everything is really good.
Well, maybe on the salty sweatshirts, no!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives the boy a self-prepared bento, which in this case is especially artistically adjusted, and hopes that the boy will know about the break at the meal.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm wondering if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I've been reading manga for the last few years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started to learn a little Japanese once.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I would have to come here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And you're highly valued here.
On the one hand Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
And the rats have feelings.
When a rat or a predator escapes danger, does that mean they also feel afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how can it be verified that they feel the same way when they behave the way we do?
The magazine "Edge" has published contributions from well-known scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conditions of consciousness without me or anyone else who has been able to prove it, if we can't even prove that they have other people's consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, as soon as we start to dedicate ourselves to another type and open up the question of perception or general awareness, we enter into an inhospitable field because hardware does not match.
When the rat gets in danger, it will do the same for many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, raining or attacking.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists look down on comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective animal survival.
However, it is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side frontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is developed significantly more in man than in other primitives, and it seems that other creatures are completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our knowledge that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primitives.
Another dramatic feature could hide the human’s language essence: because so much of his perception is linked to his language, it is often said that his consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if knowledge of the language did not matter, it would certainly affect it, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, would probably differ from most of our consciousness.
So it's hard to figure out what it looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure or, due to special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, it makes us face great problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of a conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of the consciousness that should be a scientific dream available.
It would be possible to examine the processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on the neural roots of consciousness than on causative mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
It is interesting that this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontier cortex for visualisation.
What comes out of it for the feelings?
I export them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain by knowing its own activities.
What we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a protective system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
From this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are characterized by primitives, and especially people.
In connection with the language nature there is a slight deviation of perception, because we can distinguish and categorize states by words and grammar so that we can assign them to each other.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in cortex areas and the brain stems devoted to physical feelings, such as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could easily share in the feelings of more animal species.
I can't resist it theoretically, but I think it's invincible.
Pankzeep argues that what happens to us in the rat and people seem like fear is probably both organisms alike: How is it possible to verify, says Pankzeep, whether the rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
Screaming in the face of danger - does he feel fear too?
From my point of view, it is not only the similarity of behavior that proves the compatibility of living.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: the rats and people have similar brain stems, unlike the brains.
But is he a responsible brain tribe?
And even if it was possible to prove it with a man: how do we want to prove it with a rat?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even frogs (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably basically different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special surroundings and language), I prefer to examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of the cross.
Anyway, in this case, we can wait for progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Just as I don't examine language and knowledge in the cross, I don't even examine feelings, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to view it as short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than throw myself against the wall again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platini: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"For our country, it's not amnesty.
The work has just begun, and there is much more to do in both countries."
In the timely fulfillment of the timetable of the construction or conversion of stadiums, streets, hotels and airport, both hosts are begging.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as fast as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Union Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will follow us all the time."
A more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The Polish PZPN leadership was revoked by the National Olympic Committee following numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewieck.
There is a "serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," Drzewieck said to the Polish press agency PAP.
"The President of UEFA Michel Platini made sure by letter that this step would not result in the preparation of ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were condemned only in the last season because of manipulations to forced take-off, and finally had to be able to move quickly even the beginning of the league.
Encapsulated Dennis Quaid Gives Back Hit
She wanted to advertise a new movie, she was talking about private things - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan was talking about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
The one who blows and hits again.
The late war rages with the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood players have a bad fight - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan said in an interview for American magazine InStyle last week about the reasons for her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the deception was only known after the divorce.
The motivation for this mental stripping was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - that tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "He's crazy," said forty-four-year-old New York Daily News artist, "Meg relives the history of our relationship and manages it".
Moreover, it is "politicising" that to Jack's 16-year-old son again "is publicly a reminder of the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
His thoughts on the execution are as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Prices for flights and hotels are down
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, the summers were even cheaper than 50 percent, according to one current study.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have been reduced again - this is the result of a study of American Express travel and financial services providers.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made in the first half of 2008 and found their significant decrease in the second quarter after price rise in the first quarter.
After several years of price growth on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already declined.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored on average by 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend in Paris and Rome was the most visible, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
Because of this trend, American Express considers a weak dollar price that has caused the "feeling taste of American tourists to travel".
The lower prices of hotels were also more severely affected by financial centres than industrial centres such as Hannover, Kolín nad Ryn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 per cent even recorded a European record.
In the first quarter, airline prices also showed a still rising trend:
Due to the distortion of kerosine, passengers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, even 29.2 per cent for fuel heavy-duty long flights.
From April to June the prices of flights in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the Business and First-Class classes there were less significant changes in knowledge.
In Germany prices have fallen even more markedly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 per cent increased, 23.6 per cent decreased in the second quarter.
In the German national years, according to the study quoted above, prices fell even by half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market does not exist.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of a tense situation is the interruption of non-profit lines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that announced a competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the front of the table.
In Borussia Luhukay is still unable to establish a functioning eleven.
He wrote Kristoff Klein - enlarge the Unsuccessful landing for the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got into the game late and didn't hit the point with the ball.
His report was precisely formulated and delivered out of his mouth convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in a walk to the Hamburg arena.
The catacombs didn't do much, the break between half the time ended, and most people sat in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and is more respected than a number of momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol touched and raised his finger on the sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jola.
His command must have sounded the same: I'm here with the other goal!
It didn't work out.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted more freedom.
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgese thanks head Mladen Petrić (11) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbašans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday, the Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the vividly updated table on the video scene, where their team was listed as the premiere.
It'll be birthdays without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
He thinks that the current tabular result symbolizes the incompatibility of the league rather than the dominants of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silvy, the marketers Petrić and the FC Bayern won Jansen - is slowly located, but can't shine yet.
"We need more sense and more drift," Jol said.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of flooding the rescue package caused a decrease of 700 points in the Dow Jones index.
It was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, Dow picked something up again.
About 20.30 showed this most important world stock exchange barometer five percent decrease to 10,579 units.
The technological stock exchange Nasdaq was with more than seven percent minus 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at the time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America lost about 12 percent.
None of the titles were able to strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' stock has lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, the major investor Warren Buffet had a share in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgages.
However, the full amount should not be paid back, but in several stages.
On the other hand, it should be possible to obtain an optional list of financial companies that could be paid in favour of the course, thereby reducing the burden on the public budget.
Action courses in Europe are falling sharply
The billion assistance to banks in Europe and the US investors is not free of doubt.
The stock exchange of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is highly inclusive and downloads with the Dax index.
The American Dow Jones index also loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank dropped the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The shares of the man-made financial asset have also lost up to three quarters of its value, despite the rescue of the public government and private banks, Commerzbank has lost more than 20 per cent.
Dax clearly closed down under the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and with a negative 3.7 percent scored 5,839 points.
Worldwide, stock markets are on their knees.
In New York, he started a business day on Wall Street with significant losses.
The investors are afraid that the US government's savings package worth $700 billion would not have to be enough to revive events on the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points during the first business hour, or 3.3 percent, and this is 10 809.25 points.
The American Snowman's representatives are supposed to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could speak on 1 October.
Other European stock exchanges were also dressed in one direction: in London the FTSE index was first weakened by 3.2 per cent, the CAC-40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index of Nikkei fell by 1.26 per cent to 11,743.61 units.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has recorded 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook do not sell.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not been able to deal with one mysterious phenomenon: the dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitation beam).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity should not be entirely correct.
Nearly 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flew into space.
It is the fault of fuel management, which will soon freeze, that it is now threatened by winter death.
One mysterious phenomenon has been confusing among scientists for years - anomalies of gravitational work.
Gravitational dust is an aerial maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional mobility in the gravitational field of some space body, such as the Earth.
That's why the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What scientists have been saying for years, however, is that flying bodies are not treated as much as a person would expect under a good old gravitational law.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity in speed.
The probes suddenly accelerate or slow down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by gravitational anomalies.
Several experts are afraid that even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of matter with the curve of space, should not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the anomaly of gravity by means of so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"Responsible for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of the dark mass is known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravitational force whose effect on other universe bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
It is estimated that 5 percent of the total mass of the universe is of this dark matter.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappings, it is reported that the Italian Foreign Minister is taking tourists back to Egypt.
The Sudanese kidnappings demanded a ransom of several million euros.
When the shooter was released, six kidnappings were killed.
Five Germans were taken to southern Egypt.
Talking about the ransom is about to go.
The Germans are repeatedly becoming the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourist costumes on the Sahara are, according to all, free.
Egyptian state television, Al-Arab Arabic television station and Italian media were informed about this.
Italian Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and others have been released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian state television report, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian leaders in order and security.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the background of the shooter before the hostages were released: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappings were prepared to end before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six kidnappings.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted employee said.
It's just "it's just been taken over by the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappings, and two of them were arrested.
The kidnappings claimed six million euros for Germany; the money was to be handed over by a German wife from one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with an appeal to one of the German mediators stated that the release of the hostages is spreading because the kidnappings are afraid of their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappings wanted to be missed by the female manager after payment of the ransom.
Men were to be held before kidnappings had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by Father "leaded to suicide"
A few years of fatherly abuse led a woman to kill herself, to sound before the court.
After admitting eight cases of sexual harassment, Seventeen-year-old Michael Trerise from Stythian in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," wrote Treris in confession.
The court also said that Ms. Randle was killed in her home in Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in the house.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was announced before the court that Ms. Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was pursuing a pattern of abuse, which had been committed twice a week.
Judge Ramsey Quaife pointed out that in 2006 Ms. Randle's friends, who were also very devoted to surfing and cycling, were "emotionally dead" and that she was "deprived of life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's been told she's drowned in a needle bag.
Randle stood face to face with his own father, his daughter, who wrote a confession that ended up saying, "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
It's even worse that if she didn't do that, it would probably not have happened to the court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences that Stephanie's parents have had for their daughter in those years," he added.
"It would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be charged
The BBC found that the government official who had kept the documents strictly secret on the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two strictly secret documents on the waterloo train when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were received by the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious violation of the above-mentioned law and does not imply any criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent for defence matters Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought it was going to work between the ministry and the Government's Office," he said.
An employee who is not entitled to be appointed shall be charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause which deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police of the official complain about the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret Al-Qaeda analyses and possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and moved from home to an unknown place.
B&B’s debt securities
British social security funds may have to settle with more than 80 million pounds after Bradford & Bingley saves.
The government has provided 14 billion pounds for the deposit protection of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley.
The loans will be paid by all companies that collect client deposits, including 59 social foundations.
Director-General of the Association of Social Foundations (BSA) Adrian Coles said he was "depriving", that the funds and their members had to be paid.
The fourteen billion debt will finally be paid off by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest that is raised in the meantime will be paid every year by all 700 financial corporations that collect customer deposits.
The Fund’s Monetary Services Plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 social foundations are counted under this heading.
It's humiliating that these institutions that have behaved considerately... must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the deposits should pay around 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that debt interest will increase by 450 million pounds in 2009.
That means the reserves will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Societies, told BBC that he was convinced that this was unfair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have behaved considerately during the breakup of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerate."
According to the BSA, no assets since 1945, when they appeared, have fallen.
"We'll have to look into all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what opportunities are available to protect social funds and their members from an account that might be important," Cole added.
The revenue applicable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, there will be a payout rate for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
In view of the fact that the social funds are shareholdings without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid to their members by means of higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk contains five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company announced that from Monday it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre.
It is already the second price increase this year, after two-fifths of counterfeiting in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers should decide on their own whether they want to reflect the betrayal at customer prices.
Before the fall, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Kaunas for the Bangladeshian expremire rejected
The Bangladeshi court rejected the application of former Prime Minister Shikh Hasina Vadzid for bail, which means that if he returns to power, he may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her for bail in connection with the charge that she had received a certain firm over fifty million dollars (729,700 dollars) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption brought against it.
Chalda Zijav, a long-standing political rival of Shiach Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is about to return to Bangladesh over the next few weeks, but her party, the League League (Awami League), asked the local army to give her full freedom first.
Writers say that while she was allowed to speak in an honest way to intervene in a foreign medical operation, it is not clear whether she will remain at liberty until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that the Supreme Court's regulation is now being appealed to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shikh Hasina's application for bail by not requiring bail when it is already under investigation abroad for an honest declaration," said her defender Rafique-ul Huq.
"We appeal against the Supreme Court's regulation."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail so that she could return from abroad for preparations for the December elections.
The High Representative of the League of Peoples said that Shikh Hasina was due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army held by the interim government took over, but she was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Cháilida Ziža both reject all charges brought against themselves.
Fear of Rebellion in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not been involved in a recent widespread attack against the Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations held an appointment in six provinces.
However, it says that for security reasons, children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar could not be reached.
The UN spokesperson stated that this happened despite the Taliban's promise that it would not attack or defend thousands of law enforcement workers at work.
BSkyB lost court proceedings on ITV
BSkyB lost its judgment on the review of the Commission’s decision on competition, which was ordered by companies to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting of ITV.
The Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously declared that the BSkyB’s share in the fight against competition and had had a disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought the share in 2006 in a trade which, as a result, prevented NTL from buying now renamed Virgin Media, ITV.
In April 2007, the Court of Justice Office announced that the acquisition of a share in ITV by BSkyB had given rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission to initiate the investigation.
The head of the Virginia Consortium Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against buying.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution to the disparity - especially because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigation of the affair of American lawyers
The US Chief State Representative appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
Tah came into the situation when the report on the affair, drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, legislator and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by the concern that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers of the hearing in the course of the investigation lied to the investigators with a view to facilitating justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious calls, including potential criminal proceedings, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to bring witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Ministry of Justice released nine U.S. lawyers in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers had been released because of poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the release of lawyers was no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, others refused to investigate charges of fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. lawyers are investigating and conducting prosecutions in court cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under fire for his release and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also declined.
The Inspector General's report on the role of Gonzales in the affair was very critical, saying that he was "the main responsibility" for the release that he "abdicated" from his leading position and in fact "not necessarily engaged".
Other officials, including former high-level Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Command will be appreciated
Rock star Meat Loaf will get one of the Q Awards prizes for his epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who came to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold price, said he was "honored" by his recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of the 1977 hit album Meat Loaf.
This year's nomination is run by the Coldplay group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals that Meat Loaf provided.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the top 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album was held in the kidney for about nine years and sold it all over the world more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf, a real name Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from health problems in recent years, was also operated in 2003 due to irregular heart rate after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007 the acute laryngitid forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cissus on his lipstick.
Illustrative streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, roads and other land communications, some famous, others only useful.
But even many veterans and long spaces have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This small street is located in the district of East Village and leads north of First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a transport trail.
There are no signs of street names.
It's practically invisible in the normal atlas.
However, he has a street of admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants Extra Place to redesign and create a cleaner gateway to shops and shops that are to be opened in new buildings.
The other admirers are the long-lasting neighbors who say that they were short-lived by the street just because it was one of the last remains of the time before the block was raped.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of a Building, which has a street in its power, is not interested in keeping it the least.
At the meeting of the Committee on Landing of the General Community, the representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay planned a plan that would allow the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Susan Stetzer, the county manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers the option of remaining in the city’s hands, and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only very few land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for reform and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that she wanted to reinstate a small street and sit in places where several people would use a café whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to fix this abandoned street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Building Conservation Authority, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and suggested that the task of his office was to develop the property rather than manage.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802 when the large farm of Philip Minthron was divided between several of his children, and no one made a claim on that narrow street of the country.
In the Extra Place the rear door of CBGB, a punk monument that closed in 2006, and the street is probably the most famous as the background photo on the album of Ramones group "Rocket to Russia".
"That place was amazing," says Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took a photo in November 1976.
"There were plenty of waste, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets and pipes."
Some local bloggers, including bloggers, who write about the claim of the East Village district, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that it is part of public property, whether it is clumsy, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on the name of Jeremiah’s successor New York (with the title “The Book of Guns: a Hot Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Relieving), hung out a part of the story about Extra Place from the title of the town, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark and on the day and limited by the sharp iron doors of warehouses and closed windows where the old newspaper is chased through the streets for a week."
Until a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening seemed exactly the same.
Krysa ran through the blind end of the street near the doors that once led to CBGB, where today there is a store with expensive clothing.
There were graffiti on the walls and there was an empty beer bottle next to the fresh dose of the discarded news.
A couple of passersby said he was thinking about Extra Place a few times, but he suggested that some sort of riot could happen.
On the contrary, Fields said that they think that some people underestimate the impact of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have been in places dark, wet and resistant."
Bilingualism debate: English subjugation
In this issue, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker from California and the director of the Education Department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why High Schools Need to Choose".
Effectively speaking to the Spanish voters is an ominous matter.
The educational agenda of Barack Obama just proves it.
Obama's campaign suggests that "afro-American and Hispanic students have a significantly lower probability of becoming adjudicated than white students," which is true.
In order to combat such efficiency differences, Obama's educational agenda is particularly advocated, among other things, "previous bilingual education" for those who are only learning English.
However, the question of Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in class, is not more powerful than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take the example of Sixth Street Prep, the charter primary school in the Los Angeles East period.
The students of this school are in the absolute majority of cases Hispanic from low-level families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom came from just recently, are only learning English.
However, in the 2008 State math tests, the highest level of the hundreds of students in the fourth grade was reached.
Nearly ninety-three percent of the fourth-class students were also awarded the highest level in English-language and literature state tests.
This incredible success was achieved by a method other than Obama's.
Sixth Street underlines control and exercise, constant assessment of capabilities and access without excuses.
Furthermore, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are only learning English is "complete subjugation".
Undermining in English underlines the almost basic use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a huge success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take school as Sixth Street Prep as a model, how should other schools with large proportions of Spanish and English students look?
The results achieved by the school should be of course based on the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long standstill for bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education is an indication of Obama’s response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he stated that people should stop worrying about "English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure that your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to reduce performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work rather than make fun of them and trivialize them.
The oil line is falling due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that the American plan to save financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of fixed-term oil trade fell in the early trade at the New York Commodity Stock Exchange up to 7% to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, markets with comets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, the price fell earlier this month to almost $90 per barrel, which again jumped to the huge uncertainty of the financial markets.
The anxiety rekindled the investors on Monday, even after the Congress presidency announced that the weekend had reached agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the settlement, the government announced that the Citigroup would purchase the Banking Department of the Watchvia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgish governments have partially established the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts of Barclays Capital said that a heated weekend event that led to a plan to save the economy "is shown as unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The market prospects with global shares, interest rates and exchange rates have been strongly undermined," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in the investor report.
"We're worried that comets won't be able to avoid the plague.
From a comedy perspective, our greatest concern is to what extent the American virus spreads around the world, and especially to China."
This bank's analysts limited their expectations for the following year, as oil consumption decreased due to slow growth and reduced their gas prices by around 20% for 2009.
The wild ride in the second quarter won the team's record
After spending the last eight seasons in Jets dress more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter in which Jets turned the free game into a Spanish ride.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and Arizona Cardinals made their sad game equal to the dark clouds above them.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranueuse Colese to a twelve-year touchdown sprint, which he perfectly represented on the afternoon, in which their progressive collaboration moved about a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter after two other touchdowns, including the one where he fell cornerback, and another 10 seconds before the half match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his recordings to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We've had a good time communicating, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were in hazel, the defense attacked the quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught the crazy watch and returned it by 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped off another tape and caught her.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warner to the fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens won, was probably the best at all.
Team Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he kicked Jay Feely's 20-year-old goal out of the field, which he won 34-0.
That's the most time Jets got in a quarter.
Looking at Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe the madness, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
The fall of many points in a short period of time."
Reconvenient Gebreselasia has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselasia from Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best distance runner at all, when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he won his own world record and became the first man to run a 26.2 miles long race under two hours and four minutes.
The victory on a pleasant flat track at 2:03:59 was won in 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselasia, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - has overcome the world record or is at least the world's champion at all distances from the metro mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from a look back perhaps to too scared - that the contaminated air would upset his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the target - he won on Sunday Gebreselasia with a flashy average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What traversing runners like Gebreselasia and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer track, dropped the marathon record last decade for more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebreselasia told reporters that two weeks ago he had a leap in the air and missed a week’s training.
The break was obviously more exciting than it was.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselasia told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - for planning his competitions in an excessive manner, generally avoiding the world marathon peaks, relying on guides, as if it were a race on the road, and building world records on the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can be difficult to reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Held in temp four Kenyans reached Gebreselasia half in time 1:02:04.
After the leaders withdrew, Gebreselassie was continually chased by two elite kangaroo runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
About something earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselasia he last took and fled Kwambai, who then reached the second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race ended the excellent year with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitínková, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paula Radcliff from Great Britain.
Six decades ago Mikitínk surprisingly won the Spring in London marathon last year at 2:24:14.
Beijing games left out for something described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon that she ever ran improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race wisely and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape into a big jump and then reached her after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia ran second at 2:21:31 and Helen Kippova from Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of black people's lives in a separate city
Hidden among the splendid entertainment park of larger Orlando, several miles away from all shallow, noisy and enchanted, lies a quiet city in which the pride and tension of African American life rekindled.
Eatonville, the first completely black town that was part of the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a place of five lakes, three croquets, three hundred brown hides, three hundred good swimmers, enough quay, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a bus stop.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival Zora! to present the gift of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, even though she stopped it for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the thirties when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what's coming about."
Even today, when the Montenegrin presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many people here remain cautious of foreign views.
"We pay close attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as the paradox of triumph and dragons.
It is both the historical model of the Montenegrin uprising and the community of nearly 2400 people, where poverty rates are doubled against the international average.
It is a centre of literature, but also duvets with a shadowed example of southern rural black culture - sometimes overcrowded, sometimes uplifted - that came from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about Eatonville's performance really started with Zoro, which is the only way Hurston's name is.
She presented her hometown to the world through her hearty books full of names as "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide turned the city of pieces into road No. 17, which leads through the often confused centre of Florida, into the stage of black history and human drama.
With the expansion of the big drum in life and in literature, Hurston led readers into the shop of Joe Clark's first eatonville mayor, and then turned to more personal places.
"On the left side of the road," she wrote, "it's a white lamb decorated modern national school with well-maintained courts and playgrounds, which Howard Miller is always old about, even though he can't read much."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow of Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits into the hourly hotel."
So in just a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville combined with self-government, but also with illiteracy, reintroduction and sex.
This obviously wasn't the typical load of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 19-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chipper who often returned after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Seventy - year - old Augustus Franklin recalls that when she arrived in the city, she arrived without notice in the huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore her pants in the city, which is proud of her clothes today.
Most of the residents were fascinated, said Franklin, but many complained.
"The people of Zoru always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, added, she jumps on a chair on the back terrace with a view to Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut off from the press.
It seemed like Eatonville had forgotten the rest of the world together.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary Langstone Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville there were no larger sadistic ceremonies or large public readings.
"I think they didn't understand her significance for the world, nor did they understand her reference," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's magazine "Wrapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 80s in the 20th century.
The representatives of the Orange County period wanted to extend the city five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
Orlando detachment has already pushed the national highway No. 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a complicated historical period.
The forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the struggle to stir up hatred for race brought hatred to the heart of the community.
"At that time, a party of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on the people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had one lady here who killed it.
They walked out of the melon's car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the highest court's requirement for forced integration and declared his decision in Brown's case against the Education Chamber that "it is more offensive to my race than to celebrate."
The residents now claim that the disintegration of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced consistency in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the youth here.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the group Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save Eatonville Community).
It lasted until the teachers and disciples came from the same place, added.
"You don't include your white teacher, because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil law, however, helped create space for many other Zory Neale Hurstons - black writers, artists and artists who, like her, raised themselves above prejudices with light consciousness and quotes such as "How can one resist the pleasure of my presence!
I don't get it."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston’s famous life story from Robert E. Hemenway came to the police in bookstores, which reintroduced it into the American canon.
The road project arrived just when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found the light ramp.
Former Hurstons now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to destroy its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans have arrived at the opening action two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the road plan.
"These five streams of highways have risen up, you would say that they have burned down the real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it's easier: "The clock saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project helped to change the image of the city.
Non-city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to this church in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and the inhabitants began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the national historical register in 1998.
The new single-story library (of course named after Hurston) was reopened in 2006 by Kennedy Boulevard, who was once again excavated and decorated.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlando can sometimes act as a busy street in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today it's 90 percent black.)
Other people who come to search for the story and significance of Eatonville are still being treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is necessary to have ahead and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church that paint whites and show blacks on the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a brave, confident teacher who likes a red net, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be correctly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival grew, domestic pride also increased.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, workful, funny and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's son, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, he sings a sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or with the police, who says he would enjoy some help.
And even younger, like eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonov, they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just go through here, will think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against those others,' said Alondra Kenon recently Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we're all talking very financially
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from news stations and covered TV images on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never decide that in a well-defined bee, offices over their heads have every day bankers and managers of investment funds that monopolize New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The senders still count the metal vehicles after the walk and transfer the muffin bakers to the breakfast meeting.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers and carrying, like human mules, fifty roasted shirts hanging from the trousers on their backs.
Office cruises are still waiting in front of their early luggage at the street dining stations, and it is still not possible to reach every day of the yellow taxi between the fourth and seventh afternoons.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until, with all the poems, I decided to start my savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I was on time to hide with my late afternoon sister on my local JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in front.
Not in front of the treasure windows to pick up or save cash, but in front of the crossing, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists are asked to go shopping with mixed Macy's goods and new customers are setting up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starra, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason as me.
On the other hand, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called trifts (a little like construction brokers), money companies and types of brokers whose side is operating only in one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 such banks were silenced.
A few days ago Washington Mutual, a $327 billion asset bank, went to the competition, and when New Yorkers returned home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Officials of the offices and shops that stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe port and that makes most of the rescue on Wall Street.
In the last week, the ordinary New Yorkers learned a lot of financial skills.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the Bank of Fame, and her incredibly senior executive, Dick Fulld, as if she were laughing at her cousin.
And Lyn, a uniformed about fifty-year-old home of my purse, changed the subject of our regular conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
Moslem graves exacerbated by the Austrian right-wing crime
Heinz-Christian Feare, on the left, from the Austrian Right Side of the Freedoms and Filip Devinter from the Belgian Right Party, Vlaams Belang, presented the event in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 as "The City Against Islamism".
They are similar to the transport markings that display mixtures crossed by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of defamation of the Muslim cemetery in Austria of the same weekend in which the right-wing parties have achieved huge profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the tomb in Traun, near Linze, were once between Friday evening and this morning it was hard to destroy and the police are convinced that it was an organized action.
The culprits focused on some graves of Jewish symbols such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to mask the motives of the extremists led by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear if this incident was connected to the election.
The spokesperson for the Islamic communities said they were "deeply shocked" with reports of the outrage that comes at the time of the end of the Muslim post month Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is entering a search engine for its own soul after transport has collapsed in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both sides of the right, which have won more than 30 per cent of their votes together, the Freedom Party and the Swaz for the future of Austria, have conducted a very anti-immigration campaign and some of its slogans have been criticized as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Feare, president of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 per cent of the votes, protested against bars and bars in the campaign, and even expressed his resistance to the food in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood", which is supposed to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mixtures and minerals and argue that they are political symbols of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections that have put the extreme right to the most powerful political bloc in the country indicates that this change has been caused mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter must not travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
The officials mentioned this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he was planning to leave France to Spain.
This ban on travel was passed last Thursday after she gave officials evidence of Glitter's past judgments on sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The Judicial Service said: "On Thursday 25 September, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kenyan police requested a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't participate personally."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as it records him in the register of sexual assaulters.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also forward the planned date of departure to the police a week ago.
If the obligation to inform the authorities was mentioned, it could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police announced that they would not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible journeys after the period.
The Kentian police said: "Kentan police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that manage potential hazards more effectively.
Protecting the Kent people is the highest priority for the Kent police and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual attackers to reduce any danger to the public to the minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls 10 and 11 years of age.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass the passport and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officers continued his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there, while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in Western London and at the same time successfully requested an order from Scotland Yard to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was formerly imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for owning child pornography.
The source of the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and happy that Glitter was forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
"To catch the real character, with a picture of master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No shoes, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, separated from the concentration on interpretation - I only aim at the free expression of men or women.
On the one hand, an artist.
Second, man.
Unresolved, if we forget private, in those moments far away from the public - then we can see a confidential gesture, a deep spring of caught sight, or a passionate hand gesture that is carefree, because they are not going to appear on the stage.
German Günther Bauer runs the theater at "Flamenco-people" with songs, dancers and guitarists with the less well-known faces of the masters.
With this aim, the photographer makes up a unique iconography of flamenca from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the framework of the Flamenca Month (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "is still reflecting the growing international significance of Flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flemenco-people" "can be any man, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
These people's portraits "on the street" are artists able on stage to convey passion, sorrow, joy... and fully capture the spectators.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on the scene.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamens.
In 1997 Bauer started a long way to portrait flamence singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that are reminiscent of classical photography due to the choice of camera and material.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic basis of the image and lends it the current spirit, which is the idea that, according to Bauer himself, reflects even the flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but it does not cease to surprise and develop."
What impresses the spectators is not the effect of solo dance, song or games, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet with the most important, with that spirit that emerges in the way of perception, being and living, it was and is a constant work presented during these days in the El Fotomat gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographers creates famous flamenca characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became like a flamenca anthology, and soon the book edition will contain illustrated portraits.
The passion for portraiting led Bauer to think again on the "Portrets of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTProject").
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to know them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think the picture is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or meets people, personalities he doesn't know at all, or they'll only give him a few minutes to shoot.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Galerie El Fotómata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedo de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel that writes is "troupalism"
It is played in an environment that is not yet known, and tells of events for him unknown, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and traveled to Amazon.
The eternal favorite Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival admitted that the project that is just employing it is "troufoly", and that "it all shows that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it once," he arranged his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and words, which during four days was seen in the city of the aquarium around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the Romanian "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled Juan Bravo's theater in the last place.
With Felix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him a dedicated audience who had spent an hour of time running like water - Peruvian with remarkable accuracy and a remarkable dose of humor, he remembered in it how from the original "unbelievable adventure" of "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and from "the power to live more than I have lived" gave birth to a literary message; how "the lack of inspiration" is accompanied by writing "disciplinedly", carefully twisting the text, correcting and rewriting it; or how they influenced his writing by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "memory images" are the basis of his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way," how to determine whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, a rainy experience" - stressed Vargas Llos by saying that he "is acting on people" and "must try to get out of line", and called for writers to "do not subject themselves to freedom" and "to take responsibility" of his mission.
Due to climate change, the fame of Pozoblanc is lost - there are no graves
The opening of the summits, which closes the celebration in Pozoblanca, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement that the area was not in good condition.
That is why the company, together with Fermín Bohorquez, Pable Hermos de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the battles.
Unfavourable weather conditions have long been the result of this celebration, and two out of three festivals have not yet been held.
On Saturday, he made it impossible for the rain during other planned battles.
During their formation, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bulls in the arena in Castilblanca.
But that's how it was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was rewarded for his dynamic and aesthetically qualitative performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two wounds by digging for greetings and one ear that brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreadoric art.
Even worse than that was El Juli, who passed through the Los Llanos playing arena.
In the second round of the drain without a single breath, most of the obscurity was severely criticized.
They took control in Álava in a delivery with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes five.
Road control Ertzaintza in the city district of Arminón (Alava).
The fittings stop two people driving in the delivery and they drive them.
The charge, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to the report of the Committee of the Interior of the Basque Government, they have been persecuted and detained by one of the persons travelling in a delivery, a man 38 years old, who was identified as A.A. J.
The detainee was accused of drug possession and of falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several Transport Unit members carried out road checks at N-1 in places where the border of the town district of Arminón is crossing.
They were going to stop the delivery for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, he rushed and caught fast.
When the vehicle stopped at the edge a few miles away, both passengers jumped out at the moment and fled to the forest.
Ertzaintzy’s followers finally caught up with one of them and played 2,178 kg of hashish, who suspected they were carrying out a search for Iveco Daily’s brand.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash packs, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the badge was "defiled" and did not agree with the data contained in the delivery documents, which was therefore also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for a second suspect who, as mentioned earlier, has managed to escape to finally identify the origin of the fun drug.
The detained A.A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to establish the appropriate formalities before joining the next investigation.
Herečka Heather Locklear is detained for driving under the influence of drugs
Herečka Heather Locklear, a favorite Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, told People’s Journal of California’s Road Watches.
The witness explained that around 16.30 a.m., Locklear "the gas-swirler, for the noise-swirling, went forward and backward and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times when the sunglasses passed over during the cooking".
A witness who didn't know the actress first of all saw Lockler's moment after he stopped at the nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "she was afraid of Lockler's life".
When a police guard came to the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the vehicle.
"She looked disoriented" and therefore she was taken to a specialized drug and alcohol centre to test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actor cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was excluded, yet "we believe Lockler was under the influence of some drugs, which was seen by the officers at first sight".
Lockear was detained for suspicion of the effects of the nearest non-specified substance and was arrested around 7:00, even though she was released several hours later.
Two months ago Locklear returned from a medical clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalusian IU Association to exercise its powers in the cause of Silva
General IU and Member of the United Left Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision on the case of the former Youth and Sport Advisory Committee in Seville Francesca Manuel Silvy, who resigned from the office last week after being accused of dealing for the benefit of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I am too federalist, it is on the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares pointed out, to which the party will have to step in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation of the illegal conduct allowed by Silva, there is absolutely a need for "transparency": "IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Sangre de Mayo", Epic bet of Garcia
José Luis Garci in the film "The Blood of the Flowers" (Sangre de Mayo), to which he was inspired by Episodes of the National Past Benita Pérez Galdóse, revitalizes the famous rise of the Spaniards against the French – this is the most unambicious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "explain the accuracy of the character and analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the image before the vast team of interpreters.
Flower blood with a meter over two and a half hours will be put into movies this Friday and in the future there will be more than four-hour television series Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary creation of Galdóse José Luis Garci claims that he fulfilled his "childish dream" by filming this film, for which he thanks Esperanza Aguirre, who entrusted him three years ago to the Autonomous Province of Madrid by shooting the image on May 2nd of Madrid, he accepted the offer that he would eventually come from the Epizod of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means for Garcia to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "Third Spain, which was wrong in the leadership for which it was fought - the struggle for independence led to the fall of the government of Ferdinand VII and the rest of the country," he said.
The director, however, regrets that he could not count on the financial support received from the films The Sad Wreath (Ala sad) or Goy's ghosts - almost double the number of the Floral blood - so he could not record some of the scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valcárcel, with which he works almost all his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empesar) works as he is usually used to - on stage with a player who usually does not choose casting because it feels "degrading" and he also thinks that "part of the director's calling is to go to theatres and movies, among other things, and to find out what's going on in the handbook he's doing".
Many of the actors who have chosen for the blood of May are already appearing in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranága or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci with four appointments to Oscar, one of which he received, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the only Mayal blood, the seven tables of the French billiard and the last elected blind sunflower, represents not a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that "it will only appear".
Garci doesn't expect any award for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize that you're only working for the benefit, and then you're going to pretend to make another movie," explains Garci with more than 30 years of director career.
Isabel Bayón lives up to the spiritual link of Sevilla dancer Tortoly Valencian
The Seville Flamenca dancer gives up the hold of other Seville dancers.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of the father of Catalan (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanky (Georgina Valencia Valencia Valencia), was born in the Trian district, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on Oriental dance.
She lived her life full of passion, was the advancement of women's emancipation such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and was fighting for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the interwar Europe of Isabele Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepou Gamboa and she designed this character for me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, we're not talking about her life, we're talking about her soul arrest.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the flamenca rhythm.
So the Motila dance was evocating a guajira or the Hada dance.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic," she says.
The presentation is composed of two exceptional characters: Miguel Vodez, who will be Isabelle in one performance sing as well as "Open Doors" (La porta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coralova, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her former student.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature character.
I'm happy that she accepted an offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
It also includes the music and guitars of Jesse Torrese and Paca Ariagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums of El Pájara, the film by Raf El Viola and the collaboration of the artist Juanfry Juárez, "which has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadones with all around, and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who has played for her time in places such as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she has usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some time, but no one knows her today and then less appreciates her creation," Bayón says.
The show begins today at 20.30 in the Lope de Vega theatre.
The book "Denmark freshly married" also closes triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "Denique of the Fresh Wife" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed his marriage with Zenobi in March 1916, is part of a programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian Government at the celebration of "Trianale Zenobia and Juan Ramona" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
"Zenobia Trininale and Juan Ramona" is about to end the new edition of this work, an international convention to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "John Ramon Jiménez: One Sunday", which was opened in May of this year, and after it is held by a different Andalusian province, it should be moved to New York, according to plans at the time of the congress.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of "Denique freshly married" by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and part of one of the world's most important Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like himself that much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "without bad intent" and under the awareness that Newman left, reveals his unsatisfying vision of abandoned American cinematography and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he's been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was seriously ill.
Even though he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't express in any way, and I've lost a big friend now," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my countries were better thanks to him."
No one's afraid he'll be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of the film and the government died especially in a dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-awareness is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons of pride.
When time is harsh and people without honor and only a handful of those who are worthy of you - there is no need to be Luis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was embellishing almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official supporter of Richard Nixon and the fighter for lost and defeated cases, from the foundation against drug addiction based on honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose until after his own mark of home food and biofood.
A complete treasure for a country that has made a lot of effort to forgive itself from a self - sacrificing, nourishing culture.
The stormy wave of the ravine flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, who holds Oscar in charge of Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without overcoming the top of his career.
A bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has tried to name Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox has put us all on a very high ladder," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lives today - based on honesty and leads a serious private life far away from cameras.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But luckily, people like that are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out to a hamburger when I'm at home?" I'd like to joke.
May pride in the heavens lead him to rule the earth between his daughters and his admirers - it is not too common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he played, he was the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, loving father, willing grandfather and victim philanthropist."
Unperfect competitions of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the 2012 unsuccessful year, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we run the race yesterday, I say no!
It was about him as a perfect race, and according to my court, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a snooze of nonsense that if it came to an evaluation and I was testing, it would be clearly not enough.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty one after the other.
Idiots begin by picking up a race number, which is why a person has to get out first.
I don't think it's wrong, but when a person goes there, they'll give him everything (including a chip that's supposed to pre-fill the road).
Oh, no.
Here man had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after the rise of the corresponding front) - what a surprise! - they only had a piece of size S (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy just a little shirt because it's less substances and they're cheaper?
Well, they're tiny compared to what was done on the day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon for the chip and the front on it lasted over 15 minutes, he had to give up his luggage.
It took 35 minutes to wait, which is at the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't put down our bags yet, and when it happened, with the pick-up, it was much worse.
In addition, waiting lasted 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have to light up pipelines tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not see the right time to evaluate the results of the chip that they gave me, and which, I suppose, has not recorded the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't think of this.
And so I think we're gonna have to let the well-prepared Olympic town seem.
Microsoft seeks reception (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new image recognition and human interaction system in a way of artificial intelligence - not too smart, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire area of society) and understand what they hear in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes the shapes and faces, this "receptive" can find out how many people are in the room - even remember what they have on themselves - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It also has the power to divide the present according to the convergence groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist notes a third person and understands that he is not part of the group he is talking to, and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asking if she's going after someone, and she's telling her she's going to dedicate herself to her for a moment.
It's all without the blue picture of death.
That's amazing.
But of course it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows operating system.
This week was a lot of talk about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers only had the most necessary, without competing for commercial remains, they would be five times more efficient -- man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a noise when we consider that Microsoft version of the version adds a new function to Windows and another "extra".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing importance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared online, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was the first step in Google to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband, if you have to say something to the Chinese.
That's right.
It never disappears, but there is a need to think of the "death" operating system not as absolute truth, but as relative to truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People continue to pay less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, more to the Internet browser.
The computer is turned on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time online than around windows.
What is the benefit of half the applications that run the system?
There's more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
Zoufale needs it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drinking machine there was a poster asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, confirmed the delay of a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count to 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone becomes the more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay of the expensive.
Le Fabuleus Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Azura coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one January in "The Blood Diamond" Edward Zwicka, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotro" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniformly rolled gay community.
And if we want to take his life roles into account, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle with a pointed horn that lifts the factors in the cat's circle.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cottoned pantyhose, attached and without sleeves.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleus Marcel from Brussels excels all others.
For the first time for its circulatory name - even though it is called 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, according to the legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the singer's lover Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the other quality cotton, unisex cut, different with label and (almost insignificant) Belgian flag, which have models of the non-imblematical hairs as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company is not specializing only on the tank tops.
It also manufactures miniskirts colleges, retro boxers, cashmere glasses, cotton pants, marine shirts, clothes for children, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
A huge image of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
Their new behavior in fashion now takes Cruz's sisters very seriously.
For Monica it means a lot more than just that some nice, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, Mango took part in the promotion campaign in its new residence, and the announcement of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartless and she's not brave and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that we proposed for Mango with his sister Penélope for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I participated in the announcement of the second year's "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in Opera for Valentine's Honor.
So it was a difficult, but exciting day at the same time.
What's your new collection for Mango, for which you've been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 1950s and 1960s, and we've been pumping lots of stuff out of them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around in clothes, combine and fold their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, so you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything is connected and has a lot of connectivity.
I must have liked my clothes, I still wanted to go to Grandma's, talk in my aunt's closets and check on her clothes.
It was a sensation, much better than going on the road.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my clothes.
But you know that we dancers are based on how we're adjusted so that we can feel good about our hours and tests in view of the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you costumes, you'll really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've had 30 recently, you've had a crisis?
Where are you going?
I feel better than ever before, I'm enjoying thirty.
I find that a woman is ready, has experience and lives enjoy less mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I don't do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants it, and besides being a young mom, I don't want to waste it.
As far as Father is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I'll give my child a feeling of happiness and I'll raise him with great love.
As far as the movie is concerned, there are now a few movie premieres you filmed last year.
That's what I'm looking forward to when they come to the movies.
I'm from the theatre world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything right now, and of course it's not going to work.
I'm looking forward to the premiere "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
The way you're gonna like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the screening mill on Naomi Campbell's side, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the floor like a model.
She just called me Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to participate in a beneficial survey for her "Women for a Better Life" organization, and the clothes we presented - I also selected two models from our collection for Mango - and the challenge was handed over to this NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
She's talking about a lot of things, and I know her, and I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to what he's engaged in.
She asked me to play for charity purposes, but if she asks me to make a stop, I'll do it too.
In the interests of the third world women, I'll do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly arriving with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol control should install in his car a system that prevents him from starting a drunk car or if he does not breathe.
The proposal has been made known already in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its aim is to return drivers to the steering wheel, so drivers will also have to complete the course of traffic congestion.
This experience will be shared by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for the Safety of Vehicles (FITSA).
According to the statistics, between 30 and 75 % of the cars accused of more than once for handling opium again in this condition will be held as a steering wheel.
Alcohol should be prohibited because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the air and prohibits the start of a car if the driver does not die before or if it is recorded higher than the permissible concentration of alcohol.
His price exceeds 1,000 euros and he'd have to pay for it himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that in the case of vehicles equipped with these devices 65 % have been reduced in the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that every year 115 people could be saved.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it is committed.
In order to assist in its implementation, since legal correction can be carried out in an ordinary manner, the necessary correction of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
It is tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spain's Socialist Labour Party) recommending the installation of this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40, as was the case in the program, a Spanish air force aircraft arrived at the Presidential Hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in Mexico D. F., where the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveled.
The sun had just fallen, however, but until now they had to close their eyes so that they could see the successive couple coming out of the plane.
Under the walk became a Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver if he knew that a Spanish prince and a princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, so it's great, it won't be able to get to the airport to pick up people... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's been living here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
The Mexican press, however, well knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red cover and military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to shoot an honorary rescue.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue dress and a princess, dressed very closely and with hair torn apart, he does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. he is threatening the storm.
Before they go to the hall, where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and order them without force.
At the doors of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, there is a reported Mexican television reporter waiting for them.
Best price ever delivered
There's probably no place in the world to declare a fashion price than Paris and there's probably no more significant designer and bonus than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second anniversary of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoliová, winner of the first year, yesterday she looked at her proposals in Manga's Exhibit on the Paris Haussmann number 54 bulb and almost cried with a feed.
Of course, it is the second largest trade of this company in Europe and has just been opened at 1,335 square metres.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events together with the desire to thank the proposer Valentina for having taken over the presidency of the competition jury caused us to have a heavy meal in Paris's Opera Garnier.
Mango's famously decorated Presidential Table appeared next to the most significant Chagall works even more wonderful.
Nati, who with her heartbroken regret for her brother's recent death, didn't reveal anything, dressed herself in the clothes of this ELAH badge and jewelry, over which she was holding her breath, and hung on to her son Luise - almost two meters of elegance - accompanied Valentina in front of the table at dinner to his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, welcomed him and, as a true gentleman, stayed with Baron Rothschild without a bag, because they both offered him two ladies.
Monique Cruz, who came to the store in - specifically designed - shirts and shirts and dressed in long black dresses for dinner, took a night walk after the opera with Goy Toledo, showed us the gymnasium for ballet tests and, in memory of other times, caught one of the points and marked "gold pile".
Inés Sastre did not hold back for a visit to the other buildings, but before leaving, she showed us photos of her son on the phone.
The second morning we could love the presence of Olivia Martínez - another young man driving on the bike - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own clothes and towels and asked in advance not to use any fragrance in his rooms.
The stars under the starry heaven of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001 - Stress Number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and annoying everyday life.
And to avoid this, all are summed up in one book, which will bring you to the bookstore on September 30.
The alarm rings every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself swallowed up in a fast pace that brings the present life.
The office is called a voltage and a back pain computer.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
However, there is no one or two ways to fight daily exhausting and to get rid of the world of work.
No, that number is nothing greater than and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott's outside the yoga position, classic massages and "spa" therapy on her books' pages has gathered all the "menu" options, adjusted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The book of the protests is called "1001 ways of relaxing" and thanks to the loading of Pearson Alhambra and DK brings peace to the bookstore.
If anyone feels that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, "handbook" rejects this view.
It also offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don't get adrenaline in your veins that re-balances your body and the stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Sleep Talking
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
If it happens first, it may cure you, but it's actually insignificant.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called dreamy.
She's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course one of you was told he was talking out of sleep at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadic (e.g. once per life in high fevers) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There's not only one reason to explain her appearance.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night anger, enuresis nighttime (nightly assistance) or monthly, but it does not have to be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress, or distressing situations.
In any case, it's a little bit of a disturbed phenomenon.
The intensity with which he appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it appears with great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult the expert to find out if he has any problem that causes great anxiety and thus manifests itself.
We said that it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if you are drinking with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to get too upset before he goes to bed.
So look for peaceful games and avoid violent TV programs or shows.
In very nervous children and those who are given a job to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This child will make it easier to sleep.
When a dream comes up, try to stay calm.
Remember, she's harmless to the child and she won't remember anything from what she did the other day.
Useful Councils
Don't be him.
It's unnecessary because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Remember that if you feel that you are very worried several times, it would be wise to seek advice or find out what is causing such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the attempt to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It won't work because when he sleeps, he's not aware that he can fix his thoughts.
Besides, you'll hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks, and so why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you come to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not for fun.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't take the time to worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeueren... finally
Illhaeusern finally found a way to victory again after a long time.
Without winning a major match, the yellows created more chances and managed to change one of them in victory.
The game was not during this encounter, in which the attackers were hardly prosecuting themselves, too fast.
After the first attempt by the guest captain Kauffmann, who shot from far away only by the hair of the last link, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from far, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to shake the defense of Dannemarie.
On the contrary, the opponent built a defensive wave in the middle of the field and left only agile Riahi on the edge of the attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, first thanks to the two odds of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusen, which Marais took care of, well located for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold experiment (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusernu did not enjoy his joy for a long time, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dress and leave his teammates in defeat.
However, Dannemarie was not able to get out of it and 11th from Illhaeusern, who was just a little tired of "stopping" the defense, no longer causing any major difficulties, except for the last entirely final seconds of the match, when the ball after a big crash flew very close to April.
Sarkozy is going to shoot angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride across Britain.
To face the demonstration of the force of fishermen who severely disrupted access to several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The last appointment promised to accept "in a constructive spirit", and they hope that "it will come with concrete proposals".
The Presidential visit comes at the same time as the annual meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against a sharp rise in oil prices, which reached an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesperson of the Elyssey Palace David Martinon, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure conditions of employment and pay for sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fish with impatience.
On Tuesday morning, operations were carried out in the Morbihan and Calvados departments, which caused almost 10km of shock.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but connections towards Belle-ille were not interrupted.
A filtration breach was carried out on thequiberon peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination already on Monday, when, immediately before the stockpiles of fuel ports in Brest and Lorient, they burned tyres and pallets while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc held demonstrations.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the La Manche Canal, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the ship's trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havr, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area during the evening stopped the blockade of an important refinery Total in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act themselves until the mid-term meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilivinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on how to continue on the way forward on Tuesday and on its participation in the preparatory meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Committee who did not support their movements.
"The station will continue" because "fishers will not let anything go" and "will not get to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee in Lorient.
However, fishermen who do not pay oil tax currently pay about 50 cents per litre, consider that the ship’s performance threshold is reached only when oil is below 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Great
The unforgettable representative "Buthe Cassidy and Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes also gave a tribute to the legend of the film and the politically committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
Brazil’s aircraft manufacturer relies this year on the delivery of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of a recession that is affecting the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery requirements for 2008 with 215 devices added, confirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a great deal from the Chinese market, especially with its 30 to 120 seats on the face of the scale of its aircraft.
To this day Embraer has supplied 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
The AIG considers the downturn of 15 % of its assets
An American International Group insurer, whose U.S. money has been received over water, believes that he would lower more than 15% of his assets to pay $85 billion that he was given as a reserve, writes a weekly edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside the life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, specifying a journal that cites sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Board met on Sunday evening to examine the possible outcome.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory declaration from AIG.
Assets that AIG intends to redeem include its branch of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of properties and investments in private equity, provides FT.
No final decision on these proceedings has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must rapidly obtain cash in order to pay off the 85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk that the US authorities will entertain 80 % of its capital, at the same time distributing it to the relevant ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the Snowman representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the bank: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an unknown loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points at 10 365.45 points.
The biggest current point failure in its history (about 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index with a dominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the end of the trade, 199,61 points and set to 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Connected since the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally failed following an unexpected refusal of the plan to save the Snow Representatives Bank, a plan that was to allow for a little stability to be found on the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 votes against for the representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State with the funds he requested to Henry Paulson.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal from the market that sees Congress not able to accept a certain plan," says Lindsey Piezza from FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed fears that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
"If this project is really doomed to failure (...), the staff will be handed over to Fed (the American Central Bank, etc.) and to other central banks to welcome the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, the leader of the Global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza has pointed out that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After Friday's crackdown, Washington Mutual organized the bank's bank's banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly turned around and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which suggests that markets are not "only faced with the American crisis, but with the world crisis", an analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The yield from the 10-year-old index fell to 3,632 % on Friday night, and the yield decreased to 30-year-old to 4,161 % on 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won points on the first television duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, with the task of finding out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The state of the campaign of Republicans and Democrats was not surprised when they both announced their victory in the television duel, which was followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brillant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, decline in research.
The Gallup Constitution, which examines public opinion published on Saturday, attributes Obama to a five-point jump (49% against 44% for McCaina), considers that the democrat is the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters on which Obama is directly concerned, Obama is the winner of 39 % of the respondents, while, according to the CBS survey, 25 % is the winner of McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
It's given," said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventy-six McCain has consistently raised his irrefutable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time stressing the "innovity" of his opponent in the issues that made up the core of the first encounter.
"It seems Senator Obama didn't understand that..." sounded repeated charges.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, the Republican TV show was worn yesterday.
In contrast, Obama stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his mind and he turned out to be sharp and precise.
He raised his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain hasn't understood yet, while Obama has," he said about the weekend of the Democratic Summit, which the Republican estimates does not take enough into account the impact of the crisis on the "common American".
"During the 90-minute debate that John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina for heavy rain.
He didn't even say words like "middle class" or "workers". The financial breakdown clearly benefits Obama, whom Americans consider to be more capable of saving the economy on the brink of destruction.
"Next week could be a decisive return," said influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic vision" to that of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate of the Democrats, the current deadlock is "the ultimate verdict of eight-year-old economic policy, as George Bush and Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator from Illinois once again confirmed that despite unexpected jumps on Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the tax of 95% of Americans, and also noted that the implementation of any energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions regarding the financial assistance plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and supporters of the regime demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening just after the closing of the polls at the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of the elections in parliament.
Although no results have yet been stated, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demise".
Some admit that they didn't even say, "What would it be if they did what they wanted with my voice," says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been favourable to foreign observers in order to restore negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished in the event that the elections will be considered clean by the observers.
It wasn't like that, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," said Juri Potemkin, a spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, of a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," stressed Alexandr Milinkievič, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes and we have an executive power.
If some opposition MPs get to Parliament, it will be by being appointed and never elected.
However, their entry into Parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore participate in political functioning, because " dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are not reforming, it threatens us to become a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It underlines that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of a preliminary vote (26 % of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections?" says Social Democratic Leader Alexander Kosulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in July this year.
"There was no foot in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in Parliament, those who are the most eligible."
The night's silence was lost again in the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commissions welcome success.
Interview - Blood that is safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated his tenth anniversary and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased because Hema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and inefficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the confidence of the public, who was seriously disturbed by the scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the State reserve of blood administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated by an immunodeficiency (HIV) virus and a hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Canadian government launched a public investigation by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations that such a massacre should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever stopped reporting, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, Géline's committee was set up.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was to operate Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Québec began its activities in 1998, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was exciting.
In a systematic effort to increase the safety of blood products and the continued work in this area over the next years, we have regained public confidence," he says and proudly adds that in early 2008 Hema-Québec believed almost 94% of the Quebec population.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "faith is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
"At that time we have witnessed in Europe the occurrence of many cases of a human form of the disease of crazy cows, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says a woman who has been leading the company since her founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread with blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gélineau's report, according to which, in the event that we do not know, and when serious disease is being spread, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take exclusive measures.
So in April 1999, we refused blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, this disease was safely proved to be passed on to blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of caution made sense."
In 1999 a much more accurate technology for detecting HIV virus was developed on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that enable donor blood to detect the presence of the virus itself directly, and not the presence of antibodies on which previously used tests were based.
NAT tests have been able to reduce the deafness of the time between the patient’s infection and the moment our first viruses can be detected in the blood, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without us being able to figure it out.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is one of the 12 million people exposed today.
"In other words, it means that before someone is infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
As a result, Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs through the blood product.
I believe that we can get or prescribe blood transfusions that are necessary for recovery today in complete peace," Hema-Québec, head of management, says.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what pathogen can appear in the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus appeared, which is similar to the West Nile virus that is transmitted to the blood by puncture.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary and stresses that, in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Québec must also be counted with sufficient supplies.
"They need to grow, because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which averages only 3% of Quebecans eligible to donate."
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once in 56 days, which means six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because, for example, they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they visited the country where the cold is taking place, they are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
The deficiencies are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network should be adequately complemented by how old they are and are no longer able to donate blood.
But to convince people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life today is so inconvenient that we can only find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary says.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eye bubbles and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebek, which also manages the only public blood bank from the Québec poppy line.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, pours blood rich into stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the contribution of our thousands of blood samples from the umbilical cord to the bank and we assume that we will take them back over a thousand years.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinal
The Impact Montreal was awarded a semifinal round of the first USL series during the second and at the same time a decisive quarter-final match for the total number of branches, thanks to the victory 3:1 (4:3 is the final balance after both matches) over the Southers from Seattle.
The hostage Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided first half, the depositary David Testo and Rocco Plancentino visited the remaining two goals of visual formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could consult with Matt Jordan for the benefit of the Sounders.
Note that during the first of the two quarter final matches on Friday, the impact at Starfire Complex in Tukwila was hit by 2-1.
The impact will be measured in the semifinals of its power with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled a deficit of 3:1 and finally won 4:3, but Whitecaps jumped into a semifinal cycle with a total number of branches 5:4.
The impact should be met with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details on the series of matches will be confirmed to this day.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first three Canadian attacks are ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tomáš Plekance and Andreje Kosticina last night at the Centre Bell sparked an attack on the victory of Canadian 3:2 on their own rides.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, shot the target, Plekanec gathered two assistances and Kovalev made a recording in this fourth victory of three-coloured games.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving you a single goal during the solo rides.
"I'm not ready yet," warned Russia.
"I need another match to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to manage too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice hug."
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out that by the end of the year, he is calling for early elections.
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti Liberal), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where in today's supplementary elections the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running.
"Descend between our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visual way in the conclusion of the Québec Liberal Party's summit, however, without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a picture mill.
On three large plates, a slide with remarkable hydroelectric tunnels, down, Québec from the "Google Maps" view, maps, etc.
Great means, like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the other prime minister refused to rule out that he would vote early in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy programme.
The "Sever Plan" is the fourth dimension of "vise", which the prime minister intends for Quebec, a "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern part of the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North is a "breathing with enormous potential", but he did not set the deadline, the amount of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned a number of approaches to points that could be further divorced: in particular water plants, forests, but especially the labour sector, which is driven by rapid growth with developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's calculations, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "land twice as much as France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just us, but it's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a certain national fundamental myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister raised: the gold hunt in Abitiba, Québec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after theatrical silence to see a huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, clarified the prime minister during the press conference.
"This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all the governments of today.
There is one border line that no longer exists, and if an opportunity arises, on behalf of the government this position will be taken up again," he pointed out.
Otherwise, "in relation to climate change, we also need to rethink our vision of the North," he said when he was talking about the north-west transition, which will be opened all year round as a result of the ice meltdown.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking away the territory becomes an obligation.
And what about the inhabitants of the land, the original nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani Member of Hungary), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The event was launched by the interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, where Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily summits", but a moment when "a common vision will be revealed".
The development of the North should continue in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visis" as a gasulon on the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the Liberals who have been before us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was another of the still interrupted theme of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail that raised the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival in front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois centre at the Adélard-Godbout gate.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Quebec, through Lesage, who carried out the peaceful revolution and nationalization of water power, until after Burrassa, who created James Bay, proved our party to create a future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he referred to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a series came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper superpower, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm going to be there," he confided in his members' base, which led to a great applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April that elections would not be held in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of holding elections in the autumn of this year, which makes it possible for him to do so.
However, he stressed that his program is busy, especially the federal council mission in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend session provided the head of the platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially certain "powers to change the constitution", which went much smoother: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) requires in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Quebec appoints part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Broadcasting Council who should have veto rights in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was to adopt sceptically in its main features.
Chief PQ (Parti Québec) Pauline Marois once again withdrew the Québec North Development Policy, which was released by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, this policy was rejected.
If she held on to it, "we'd be going on today," Marois noted on the side of his candidate in Jean-Tallon (where elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But let's assume that it's not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who returns from the holidays today.
Letters - Untreated countries
It was Vic Toews, former minister of justice (on irony) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself to say last year about Louise Arbour that she was a "hanbu" for Canada.
That's how to drown a woman who's been leading a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our surprises, that's a lot about the Prime Minister's environment and Stephen Harper's own.
We have a government in front of us, which as one of all the participating Western countries did not return to the rule of its state-owned officer in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even know that at the time they were supposed to play the acts that are being committed to him, Omar Khadr was a teenage teenager.
The only government that, although Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has closed its words and lets itself be shaken under the conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Note that UNICEF, Amnesty International, and in particular the Association of Canadian Lawyers, are defending the repatriation of Omar Khadra in order to be able to wait for a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes before the torture: it hardly cares that this young man has been psychologically destroyed in the future, and it has no doubt endured, after so many years of oppression.
We don't realize it, but we're just witnesses of the sober erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so excited about and that his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no morale anymore: it is possible to torture the Canadian citizen, treat him badly, to imprison him according to the boss of the minority government (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that declares the Truth, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and seriousness.
Hanba is, Mr. Toews, in this denial, not elsewhere.
Views - Orwellovský discourse by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian labor company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, it confirms that the largest gold producer in the world has initiated a trifle of authors and poor little burdenload for insulting honors with the aim of calling for a "transparent public debate" and demanding six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of an insult to honor, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver misses this fundamental resolution completely.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, bring anyone to the ground who dares to take the wrong position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend decent sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight with the army of lawyers supported by almost no-one labour society pockets.
The tactics in these unbalanced struggles are often in the destruction of the defendants in order to bring about a vicious proceeding that will silence the mouth of the opposite party and also frighten anyone who dares to commit this thing.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had her eyes on the whole thing to present the public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold acts, in Canada there is a debate about normal circumstances in the exchange of thoughts, not in wounds.
Therefore, it was not enough for the company to open its books, its documentation and create a real debate through the news, the media, the publication and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and is reluctant to accept petitions and letters to support the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate" and at the same time challenge the views of the public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world refers only to the well-paid lawyers, not to all Canadians; it is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
They have the right to speak in democracy.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects brutal ways of working.
The public is prepared to hear and assess Barrick, but on the basis of civilised exchange of arguments, not within what many consider to be a complaint in which they are to be sued (as part of their 'public debate' complaint, Barrick has, by the way, just called on Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
If we mention the surreal Garver's speech, the complaint initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of inquiry and the search for truth, which is essential for every democratic society.
It generally denies the right to quote confidential sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis for intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada, it's impossible to study and discuss topics that don't like the rich companies of this world without being exposed to a repeated complaint, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she was guided by the scientific standards used by Noir Canada authors.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has been able to deal with debate and disagreements for a long time now and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive complaint clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world it is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures that would limit such an unjustified complaint.
Operation on the rescue of Wall Street - Democratics and Republicans Understand
Bush's administration and lecturers to Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the biggest saved economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan, using US$700 billion to reverse the financial crisis, which has been culminating in Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for better control of the elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of the public money stored, new measures to capture the number of homes spent on non-payments and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid by the company's managers.
US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the conclusion of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective on markets," said Bush's administrative representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis just taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the main point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and disruption of American daily life will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
During the last few hours, the negotiations ran at the maximum turnout from fear of the effect that would be further failures at the investor's disposal.
The time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates to the US President were invited to negotiate later and both expressed themselves rather for the agreement, but did not mention expressing their discontent that it was necessary to withdraw from such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to enable the owners of the dwelling and the wage measures of the state-run workers saved by the companies.
"If we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned by another station, whether he would vote for the proposed plan, said, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The rough drawings that I have read, [they say] that this is something that we will all have to spend and that will help us to continue.
Choosing inaction is in short notice unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to buy money from taxpayers for suspicious claims and risk and non-sale assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis broken down by the breakup of the bubbles on the property market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to another expanded form of loans (PCAA) and stopped in the freezing of cash and in the bank and financial institutions.
The failure of the first proposal for an agreement from last week shall be borne in mind by the Republican Members.
Since the Democrats have agreed that some of the "toxic" assets of companies with problems will only be handled by the government, but will not buy them back, they are convinced that the unprecedented situation is blessed.
In an attempt to bring the anti-agreemental views closer together in Congress, a measure has been added that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its contribution if, as a result of the programme, it has to recover losses for a period of five years.
The new plan shall be calculated with the contribution of the first amount of 250 billion to which another 100 billion may be added if the President considers it necessary.
The contribution of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for Washington's help, he'll get shares in saved companies that will pay off his dividends in case of profit, which will be able to sell again when it's all over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the disposal of the properties associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as setting limits for the level of assessment and compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected.
The Plan Officers would like to vote in the Chamber of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts that have been made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes were taken against both in the Republican and in the democratic camp.
"It is quite clear that Washington will not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Financial Commission for the Snow White.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, it is not a solution for the taxpayers."
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, moderator of Congressmen's group called "the Committee of Skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize holders, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it is derogating from the purchase of its competitor, which is in the process of bankruptcy since it lost EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis in the purchase of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the 10 largest insurers.
"We will not come to this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos said yesterday.
"On the other hand, we get election rights in the bank and influence.
And it's just the mediators and the households today that can really appreciate."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, the British government seems to have launched another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion (US$75.5 billion) had made loans to buy property.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank of Santander will buy the sides and the account of the customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially committed icons
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his trumpet, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor get away with a charming joke about narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and ingenuity of his own talents also distanced him from the powerful category that produces real stars.
But what a long way it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut due to lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of American cinematography.
Less powerful than Brando, who had been like and for a long time a rival on his film album, Newman was a more careful actor, indeed a Christian, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and mother from Hungary.
One of these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last quality mark.
Because he saw this whole country in love with himself made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in battle, who started his 50th year of acting in Yale, then visited New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in the theatre, television and film attacks.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer, who was second at the 24-hour Le Mans in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, and yet since 1958 he created a model couple with the actress Joanne Woodward.
With it are also the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the adventure of its own show-business, which will remain to a certain extent confidential.
A good man, in the most noble word of meaning.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend led to the return of lovers of the film, while his great role together is rivaled by a black wage memory.
After him, he has been defiling more than half a century of constantly changing American art.
In memory, the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who refuses his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Kočce on a hot roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From less ancient times (1990), we are equipped with his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who has been discontented with old age marriage, which has not fulfilled all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls went into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a devious, violent, unforgettable delinquency from Someonebody Up There Likes Me (In the sign of hatred) Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 Newman introduced into true knowledge.
A perfectly great gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
A hot and vengeful baller in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rosen (1961), the same character was created in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face of travelling ages, it was him.
And again, he.
In his professional career together, he's a rival of different ages.
Young people especially know her thanks to the cult-based Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He then completed his career as a farmer of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which were relatively soon abandoned, Newman remained in the long industry, even though Hollywood condemned his crimes, incidents and omissions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered her "for a live underplaying challenge", judged that in his performance he pushed too much on the ball.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as proud, the profession was not always as tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and despair, whose fall and rebellion reflected in his perfect image.
As director of Newman, he discovered little known page of his shy sensitivity.
His film Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played the leading role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, his son, Scott, who lost him due to overdose, was devoted to the work of Harry and Son, full of cold and sadness.
In the trap that Newman got yesterday, his great friend and former co-worker Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) dismayedly declared: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Dearness, love of life, such are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
If we mention his legendary career, there is also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opposition to Hollywood's fall.
His appearance was common to see on bottles of vinegar, sauce, biscuits, and other foods, which might have seemed rather tasteless to us, even though it was at first a gag.
However, the proceeds from the sale went to his Foundation account for the difficult childhood.
Newman got so, rather than let himself get caught up in fame, he's been engaged in society for the last time.
To his five daughters he left a letter containing these words: "Always and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here."
And it was an honor for us to follow the life course of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
And besides, the end of the model citizen.
What was produced in the factory on the Zuschlag & sex.?
In the meantime, 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their associates are, in addition to other criminal acts, including the counterfeiting of documents, accused of misleading the long-standing and systematic criminal organisations, which have resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutors, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often presented tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and self-governments - about 65 million forints - have traveled in part to the Fiatal Balldal treasury, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money obtained in public competitions was chosen on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter-value and that the company’s commitments were never met.
According to the complaint, most of the invoices were false.
Prints of these invoices came from the Josefvaros market, the bullet seal was produced in Kiskunahalas.
On behalf of which company the production of the invoice is to be carried out, it was decided, inter alia, on the road to the northern coast of Balatán, on which István Lános Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, the first-named guesthouse and restaurant was to be visited.
In them he applied for accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in the framework of public competitions issued by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively by the Government of the capital, were produced.
The invoices were published mostly by István Lados with his partner Andras Hijrim, who, according to our information, most frequently wrote the reports needed to obtain the subsidies.
On his "Student Road" Lados saw a basement.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlagem and his associates in 2003, this after-hospital feeding facility was provided for the 1990s group of Biztos Pont.
However, according to the company leader, so many people would not be able to find themselves in this facility at all.
Similarly, the invoices presented in the year 2002 with the name Job Jöv ́ért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évérdért were confused with formal and substantive errors.
The pension in Badacsonytomy had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, yet there were a hundred and thirty guests listed on the invoice.
However, the authors of the printed articles with a rich imagination ignored this even when they introduced the documents of a company dedicated to the same hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in which, according to the information provided to the State representative, the documents bearing the name Job Jöv ́ért and Hoppá did not even appear.
The head of the company Gy-z-farkas for hvg.hu indicated that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the mark in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formality, there was no agreement that hundreds of people had been accommodated, according to the invoice, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have so much capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, and their restaurants have not been working for a long time.
Horrible invoice producers were not even convinced that the prominent Budapest travel office is organizing only foreign travel, and on the cash payment invoice, which also did not match the company's billing practices, they introduced jokes as a travel brokerage service in Hungary.
Furthermore, as the investigation revealed, they also included VAT in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On the four documents of the Jobb Jöv ́ért of the company Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, to the amount of VAT. However, the company's activity is not covered by 25 percent but by 15 percent of VAT, in addition to the fact that the hotel's employees had only printed invoices, but the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, the "publishers" have damaged the invoice by stating, in one company, how it was discovered by the investigation of State representation, as a road transport activity of goods which the company originally did not carry out on investment advice.
The fact that invoices are issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évesredért and companies XXI. The background of the cultural Egyesület and Biztos Pont were false, also broke due to the formal deviations - the inadequate format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
Just as in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehérto, whose representatives denied that invoices would be issued.
For example, the cheaters did not even notice that the company HIB s. o. from Nyíregyháza was at the time (2001) when a group of Fiatal Városért, in liquidation, was concerned about it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner, also complained that he would issue the paper.
The invoices were handy
The second group of invoicers is made up of those who knew they were supposed to exhibit a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for about four million Forints for the Harmadik Évérdért Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Balladal - Ifjú Socialisták.
Collab s. r. o. received, according to the complaint, a fictitious account issued by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlagem and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. r. on, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Jobb Jöv ́ért and Atlas and Vörösfeny with invoices worth about five million forints with no real economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, but the organization has forgotten to mention in its documents.
Another group of invoicing companies are those who have had links to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorised representative of the Ukrainian acting company Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, with a seat in Budapest, but the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer technology worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kishinhalast company Cash Investment s. r. o., which was in liquidation from 14 September 2005.
One of these companies was a man from Romania who was supposed to submit letters in 2002-2005 concerning Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to Atlas, Hoppa and the Együtt and Harmadik Évérdért and accepted their own countervalue.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian builders were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment s.
However, not one of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant because they didn't get the job.
However, he benefited from the fact that, at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their starting letters, he issued an invoice on behalf of Atlas and Y-Generácion companies linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the company Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
State representation found that Kubatov had reached 10 per cent of the amounts shown in invoices and VAT.
For the exhibition of fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, a man also used Szi-Beri's company etc.
J-Generació and Sjövetség and Modern Magyarországért presented proposals for a public competition in January 2006 at the Nadace Mikhalye Tancsicse (TMA), a publicly successful socialist party organisation.
They received 500 thousand forints but did not impose the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to disclose it, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found at a home survey at the Arpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
During the counting of the defendants, it is likely that he will describe the course of the invoice production, as he has already done in the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if it is decided to reveal everything to the chief accused János Zuschlag himself.
His modern - day statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will expose everything widely, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in his interest - to replace a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, with which the socialists may have concluded an agreement, and Zusi will take it on himself.
He could have been injured so far, because his application for a reduction in the conditions for his detention, namely the place in the home prison, remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crime, who have suffered much greater harm than they have ever done, can walk freely or at least wait for the end of their proceedings in their homes, he has no option.
Psychology of trumpeting: Why waste more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, value goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behavior have been able to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and the economy of New York University.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people do not want to stay in the eBay auction competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Research using experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers sat, the other group participated in playful auctions, using a method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active area of the brain of subjects.
In both games, participants were able to win money, but in the auction game, which is an important element to break down the other side, they began to work intensively when losing a whole that is under the brain core, called striatum.
This brain area plays in addition to many other functions in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, it is possible to explain how to avoid direct street reactions.
To support their theory, members of the research team from a number of economics carried out financial cross-border research.
Under different conditions, he was tried against one partner by three groups.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they quit the winning game, they would get another $15.
On the other hand, the third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
So the difference between the two groups was all about winning and losing.
However, members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "victory" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
For so far, they have explained the phenomena that can be seen in the auctioning joys of winning and avoiding risk.
When neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the difference between these two theories, we now have a third explanation," observed Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of New York University.
Hepatitis: When to find a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, then in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the major causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand of them are treated, which is why the patient often does not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the summary name of the infection caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, there are signs of inflammation of the liver and the liver, but the origins of the disease and their underlying disease differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways: hepatitis type A and E with lawnmowers (e.g. food, water infected), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and fluid viruses (sperms, secretion, spleen).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against A and B virus, and no vaccine C virus exists.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, usually caused by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, vomiting.
Then, on the skin and eye whites, a yellowish, bright stools and cloudy urine are formed. The treatment can last for two to three weeks.
Every year millions of people worldwide die from the most serious type of this disease, from liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only every tenth infected drug is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to liver cirrhosis or cancer of the liver.
Most people who are infected with their disease don't even know, the origin of the disease destroys the liver cells eventually, so the first symptoms are delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
This is why timely prevention, regular testing is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs more frequently than on average: between people who had undergone blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
At present, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since disease can prove an already routine laboratory test, a person should, in case of any sign of unknown origin, refer to his or her doctor.
In early detection, the disease is therapeutic, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infection and preventing cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was organized by the organizations representing the disease for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to highlight the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its emergence and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God, that's so bad?
According to recent research, faith in God is a certain analgesic, which could have facilitated the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examined the way in which faith in God’s perception of pain affects man, reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
Within a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed the painting depicting Miss Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of carefully examining the human brain, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for controlling the pain.
Research is the first of the series of studies attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was carried out in exactly the same way that the left hand of the test subject was attached to a sparking instrument that issued electrical shocks.
The researchers asked participants to try to observe two paintings carefully: Sassoferrat Miss Marie from the 17th century and Lady with the borders of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of Ms. Mary would bring a certain state of worship to the believers, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because from the very first it was too different and acted according to them with a soothing impression.
The pilots spent half an hour in MRI scanner and during this period received four consecutive parts of 20 electroshocks, while watching images separately with religious or general themes.
The Catholics said that in view of Miss Mary they felt "in safety", as if they were "careful" and "be calmed down, filled them with peace."
They felt 12 percent less pain when they were watching religious subjects than when Leonard’s work was before them.
A psychologist named Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, is of the opinion that such an effect can be achieved through any powerful image even among atheists, just one must find the right picture.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of the mother or father," the psychologist said.
British Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The exercise of faith should change and in many cases will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such excellent results, the only question is what the effect would have on the regulation of the pain of the believers if they were to show them some madon from Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would the look at Miss Marie's quality mean that she's getting even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
About their tenth birthdays, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, on which is the professional examination and what interests them.
According to Erica Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, with regard to skeptics making parallels with Orwell's dark vision, these are not exactly the very substance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google founders to keep their original intention: "Let's get all the information in the world!"
According to the above-mentioned representative Google, the company is standing after ten years of secular work just before it can work with all the information.
To ask what will be in five years, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what work would actually be good for me?" - to such apparently simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all users of the Internet know well that the exact search words are captured during the Internet search, and what IP addresses were searched for and on which site the interested parties moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep their browsing history, look back at what they were looking for, and click back on what they were looking for, which then in the long term generate the findings adapted much more directly to them - on the same logic will also be based on the Recommendation Service, through which we will have the system based on the above-mentioned and retained preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm doing? - the users who look at Google's data monopoly are asked to fear.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is far more severe, the counter-reaction does not cause the Internet users to be aware of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that not only are all searched expressions caught, but in justified cases the third party may also be issued, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users shall not be taken into account.
The most famous recent example was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community sites of Orkut, established through it.
However, Internet users who are afraid of personal rights could still breathe in May when the company had successfully proved its truth in the fight against the FBI by hand with the EFF e-law organization: Google should not be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully fought nearly fifty thousand websites and thousands of searchable expressions that it has obtained by appealing to strengthen the years prior to the adoption of the Child Protection Act, however, it has not been able to obtain a list of searchable items of individual users, and a complete list of websites and keywords covering the two-month period.)
The view on Google is quite controversial: it is harassed by those who fear to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use the services of Google, exposed to injury, and acting against it with a revolution that belongs to transnational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wildebeest, gathering around itself excited computer fans, activists and users who appear in many countries, in it sees a new generation of Velcophers, "Corporate What Now Aways", unlike his rival Microsoft, considered to be the world's producers for Windows, however they both fight for the same purpose.
This can be caused by Google not requiring identification code from its users and does not want money for their applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and software packages are much more available, younger, "coolier", than is the practice of official software.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand precisely the very problematic internet connection and personal rights, which has brought with them just one of the most sheltered keywords of the last few years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind the tracks and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can take a profile immediately on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm application, recording his listening music, all of which can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also write a blog that will automatically reveal his latest photo gallery, which is based on Flickr or Picase.
At the same time, we can learn a lot of exemplary cases, from which she explains: in the morning when she looks at the flood of photos of shared friends, she easily finds out who her passionate friend was spending the night with, or the company can throw out her employee just because on her blog she makes her honest opinions about top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely overestimated today.
Whoever lives online lives is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basics hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid a Google monopoly has an option (Scroogl, which uses Google search system, but does not intentionally touch the tracks).
For example, a small number of people are not registered on community sites so it is not possible to find them. Online application Google from the text editor after photoeditor and the news portal can be exchanged as an alternative version that is not connected to large server parks and which does not set the best possible profile of us.
Public opinion is not too secret to expect when Google shows teeth.
The company has its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion or Coca Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense's advertising areas threaten the investment of advertising agencies and services that are constantly being introduced at a fast pace, not only seriously depriving Microsoft of life, but also many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find the counterpoints that seem to be disturbing: for example, senior management has completely rejected workers' protests after it brought double fees for corporate school, whenever the daily feeding of employees was too expensive according to the company's management, however, it is losing the fact that in 2006 Google was still hiding before the Chinese government and, in the sense of their agreement, filtering out any finding that is due to the good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never introduces new services before, just when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can be shifted around the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such dimensions that it will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of its health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material even for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel by Cory Doctor "Scroogle" describes with Orwell's reminiscations the future, in which one can approach the human with awe only with data from Google.
A double killer from Ozda helped to remove the feet of two young people
Two young people heard from the police in the case of a double homicide in Ozda, allegedly helping to remove the traces of this crime, said Borsod County Police Department spokesperson on Tuesday.
Persons suspected of having been found and currently accused of committing a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to MTI's two girls, are being held free.
Helping a criminal is punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
The suspect of a double homicide in Ozda, the 23-year-old man here, was arrested on Sunday.
He's a suspect of a crime that has been planned for several consecutive murders for real reasons.
During the investigation it was found that the 23-year-old man owed the 53-year-old man a higher amount.
The suspect didn't want to pay off his debt, so he pulled his believer out last Wednesday into one of the Ozda's operations, where he killed his husband first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was prepared to commit a crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed a murder weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapons and the circumstances of their use are investigated by the police.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a percentage package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, although the Czech Warsaw Stock Exchange had already been excluded from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is a state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of a Polish state that wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic journal E15 writes, the Polish offer represents the highest amount that has been offered by interested parties to the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange of securities, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the loss of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with an estimated 25% share, followed by the Czech Combustible with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European Charter
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European lists are already referring to "the second 11 September".
For a global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, who brings up the accusations of the Roman La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to dry his own side in support of the speedy draft of the law, which aims to correct this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second September 11th.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the world economy has led to the collapse of the dark lack of political leadership.
The danger of undermining the American financial system is constantly growing, and the world will pay for it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to solve the crisis.
World economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be overlooked, says the Geneva Journal Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states can throw a life-saving circle back at the returning monetary institutions and taxpayers can save them from the collapse.
However, if other banks fall as domino pieces, then neither money nor other improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move through their national selfishness and to join in the control of fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone they received the prominent financial institutions of more than EUR 100 billion, recalls the Vienna Der Standard, which says they are afraid that, like the Americans, they will have to reach deep into the pocket and European taxpayers, increasingly real.
The European Union is facing a crisis that, like tsunamis, is falling on the old continent until it has really been taken care of.
"Savers" don't have to have a Stambillion euros right away, but it would be good if they were to determine, in which case it is reasonable to collect taxpayers' money to prevent even more damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of an ant
What would perhaps be the best way to develop technologies that are able to prevent collisions, unless imitations of obstacles detected in the natural world?
For example, at the bee.
The original strategic idea of a surprise project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, has been inspired by engineers from Nissan Chemellac. It was about building a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic control system for BR23C, a robotized mineauto equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can eliminate all contaminants.
"During the summer, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very much like our safety safety package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of the brand for the area of technological PR and research and development.
An important role is played by complex eyes, which allow the bees to see in all directions in an arbitrary angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the complex eye function, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser distance.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres before BR23C in the 180-degree field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the ship’s microprocessor, which is immediately switched into an operation to prevent the collision.
The obstacle is caught during the break of the second, then the robotized car begins to imitate the movements of the bees and turn the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this movement is carried out in a completely instinctive manner.
"If not, the robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology is the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety protective packaging within which the impact is currently considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bees do to avoid other bees.
This process can't last longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or perpendicularly, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can be rotated around the wheel.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to the bees when avoiding them, in the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of turning, speeding and slowing was applied.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium iont variants.
According to Andoa, an important instinctive, intelligent reaction is not the ability to process, the less the data storage.
This mechanism must process and react only to several incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it still uses only memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need a giga or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of technology serving to the immediate avoidance that Nissan estimated could get into seriously manufactured cars over ten years.
A further possibility of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the intended ultimate goal after the roadblocks have been avoided.
Damned dear child already has a name
The Law on a Savings Package of $700 billion, which is to be distributed into several instalments and which aims at the purchase of unquality loans by banks, already has a written form.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations that ended until Saturday afternoon of the American Eastern Time, representatives of Congress reached an agreement in a few days' debate on a rescue package of $700 billion, the Reuters agency announced.
"We have made significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the House of Representatives, announced, according to which only the signing of the agreement is left.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both President Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock on the night of Washington time (i.e. on Monday at two o'clock in the morning of the Central European time), but no special rise in stock exchanges was made.
On the proposal for a legal norm on behalf of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to be established, the Commission will vote first on Monday, and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosio on Saturday night, and the agreement was also welcomed to the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and very much appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesperson Tony Fratto said.
The programme differs from the original proposal by Bush's administration, in which it was intended to purchase non-quality securities secured by mortgages, all of which amounted to $700 billion.
It is now possible to lose in the first round of up to half the amount of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used as soon as things are expected Monday by Congress and the Ministry of Finance will buy them valuable securities secured by mortgages that are valued as quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special body, which will also be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank.
The creation of a second half of $700 billion will depend on another Congress decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined approach within the meaning of the law: it can at the same time buy off non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "poor" loans.
The purchase may take place in the course of the auction even directly, communicated by the competent representatives of the ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with guarantees of funds that are a cause of concern, for which companies will then pay the price corresponding to the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the American financial system totalling up to $700 billion, whether there is a wide purchase of bad funds, their insurance or the prevention of systemic risks associated with the collapse of some of the large money institutions.
"We take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The chief banks that have got into trouble and are waiting for state aid, on the contrary, can be counted by the fact that they are being reduced by the government - which is simply called "golden fall" in the foreign chain.
Their payment will be limited only in certain cases, and these restrictions will also depend on the way in which they are provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry buys in the auction, a tax charge will be imposed on gold deposits unless the bank’s directors fall directly into retirement.
In the case of direct redemption of non-quality loans, the government shall aggressively step up to ensure that the management money is not overrun.
It should be added that the existing gold-discharge contracts are not being changed, the restriction is only about new contracts, which is to be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history when there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of directors-general," said Barney Frank, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the State will join the participating banks in the share right programme, which reduces the risk of taxpayers, as soon as the economy and the saved bank with it are put on their feet, they can also benefit from this transaction.
The draft plan contains that in the next five years the President must submit to Congress a proposal laying down how taxable persons can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there have also been votes on both sides in relation to the plan of doubt.
"The American citizens didn't ask us for this, that's what taxpayers don't want," said a Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, judges that the provisions imposed exactly on those responsible for violating Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to grow
Domestic sales prices in industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008, compared to 12.9 per cent in July 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry were above 1.1 per cent in comparison with July 2008 and fell by 3.9 per cent between.
Production prices in the industry were as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month of more than 0.7 per cent, with an annual rate of 3.2 per cent.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 per cent over the previous month.
Also, domestic sales prices in the processing industry increased slightly compared to July by 0.1 per cent.
The biggest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly price increase in the manufacturing industry of flour and cream products by 4.6 per cent, and the production of footwear by 2.5 per cent, respectively.
A higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly price increase in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
A reduction in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the paper industry and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other processing industries, we measured an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which has a heavy weight in the domestic industry, prices increased by 0,3 per cent in August, particularly with the continued effect of the official increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic waste in the individual processing industries, prices grew most in the oil processing industry (32.4 per cent).
In the competition sector, it was possible to observe 13,2 per cent, in the production of food, beverages and tobacco products of decisive weight, then an 11 per cent increase in prices.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent) and in the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In other processing industries, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water sector exceeded prices from the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
From the point of view of the sector's target, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the sectors concerned with the production of heavy assets occurred in August of the domestic sales.
In the consumer sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in energy processing and further processing sectors did not change due to the previous month.
The biggest price increase in the same month of the previous year was seen in energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent) in July 2008.
In the consumer sectors, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent, rather than a fall in prices of 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in the forinets increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3.9 per cent in the twelve-month comparison.
Our domestic payments over a month have decreased by 1.7 per cent, by 7.1 per cent, compared to August 2007, by 7.5 per cent, and by 15.9 per cent.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to King Gönczov, there is great hope that around 12 January the US-Madher Agreement will enter into force, the foreign ministers spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "now almost everything matters only if an electronic system of travel permits is established at sea, respectively."
At the same time, she pointed out that part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists would have to be allowed to register before leaving.
The Hungarian diplomat's representative has been going on since today in Washington.
He will meet with the foreign ministers of Condoleezzo Rice, who will transmit the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order for the merits of the Republic of Hungary and will conduct talks with the adviser to the foreign policy of Presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank's rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidents of both major American parties, agreed on Sunday to provide their support for the government's bailout package worth $700 billion, but they are also politicians who demand the demise of finance ministers.
Following several marathons, the Congress and the representatives of the administration were announced early Sunday morning: the basic agreement on the bank's rescue package was concluded.
A financial package aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market became a central issue for the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is well-known as the most suitable candidate to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most delicious research at the same time as they got to the forefront of the economic issue, Obama gained a certain advantage again and McCain's jump, which he secured after the Republican Convention of the appointment of Sarah Palin as Vice-President.
Obama said on Sunday at a pre-election meeting in Detroit hope that the package law of 700 billion will be adopted quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passports relating to consumer protection, which he also supported.
"We must act immediately, responsible (...) to your seats, savings, the entire industrial sector, the stability of the entire economy is at risk," he said before the 35,000-dollar dam.
He didn't let himself be allowed to call McCain's ideas about the economy the old.
McCain, in a conversation with the ABC TV station, explained: "All this will be a little bit of a story... but nothing can be done."
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission to supervise the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation for the senior representatives to which it was due.
Obama told the CBS station that McCain did not have a more important role to play, but he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the president of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill on Monday.
Review of the print of the German language area
The right camp is unbreakable, only voters inside it have become more self-conscious - so analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule Austria to prevent red-black coalitions.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
In an online edition of the German news magazine left, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers."
According to a well-known politician, CSU's erosion began a long time before his office took over Beckstein-Huber's sad duo.
For decades, Christian socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away from it.
The establishment of the period, however, is a problem of the entire Christian democracy, and so is Angely Merkel.
The debate was not completely surprising for CSU, but on Saturday it ended a process that could have been assumed almost ten years ago: it ended the irreconcilable hegemony of one side.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed 47.7 per cent, the first of 50 years below the 50 per cent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, which is still in the so-called Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that it feeds its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but in tempo they were very mistaken. Secularization, educational results, German settlement from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU volunteers.
Modernisation is linked to an increase in opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right camp is unbreakable, only the voters inside it have become more self-conscious, more critical, more confident.
It is also evident that in recent weeks, CSU has been the most remote of classic civil society; people in the free profession, live-ins, seniors and university education.
The CSU's support has already dropped below 40 per cent.
The Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Videnjník is referred to in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The Presidents are in questions of the coalition of detainees" devoted to the confused internal political situation arising from the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to deal with EVP.
The EPPO shall instruct the involvement of SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears as open to all negotiations, greens still do not want to be painted on the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything is going around the coalition; in the debate organised on public television, the presidents did not allow themselves to look into their karate.
President Spö Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to deal with the EIA.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both sides is certainly possible - in some member countries and in the social partnership.
The question is whether he will introduce himself to the coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current President of the EPP, as vice-cantor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Multerer course was voted on every fall.
The repetition of this direction is pointless.
Molterer responded to the red bids carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the EIA.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still fully open to the party, these questions need to be discussed firmly within the EIA.
President BZÖ Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalitions, we are ready to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
Jaróká: A mad circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which is hosted by France this year, was launched by the current Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Movement of Fidesz, as one of the main speakers of the professional accounting in her plenary message, paid attention to the segregation in school, because it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit started - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
They sat between the representatives of the governments, the European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Euromissions Group of Movements Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of the labour force, the Roma are expelled from the European labour market mainly because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, they can achieve a higher level of education than a small part of them."
The Irishman further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these relationships in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
The earlier the Roma student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income tax and consumer taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma have the right of their state citizens of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the removal of their lack of quality and separate education," said Livia Járóková.
According to the honourable Member, the coherence of the European Union with emphasis on the objective and the negotiations is necessary in order to speed up the process of deaggregation of schools, which is a priority for proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the magic circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to provide Roma children with the opportunity to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková asked.
Everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Summit of Equality, organised annually since the last meeting in Berlin, by the European Year of Equal Opportunities, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination at the level of Europe as a whole and of the individual Member States.
CSU: temporary grace
The judgment of the obedient duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Even in the face of a ridiculous election debate, the debate on personal issues has so far been rejected by the points of the Bavarian CSU.
The President of Erwin Huber and Land Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered the disastrous 17% loss of votes, will determine the last October's extraordinary congressional weekend.
In any case, members of the highly criticised duo were told that they would not be the fifth of all the forces in their positions.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the group and the foundations, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavoric tsunamis" were exported personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - she received 60.7 percent of the Christian-Social Union, now, year after year against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of the forces were sufficient.
In Bavaria, CSU produced 18 per cent of German HDP as "self-owner" over 46 years.
Nevertheless, the conservatives in the southern community have a key role to play in the Hungarian economy, a high position, but in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
One of the first signs of the reorganisation within the party is that a member of a close expert team that launches the trial negotiations on the possible coalition of the government of Munich with the liberal FDP, and with the legally oriented free-voice assembly, will also be the Vice-Chairman and Joint Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a potential successor to Huber.
It is ironic to say that Gabriele Pauli, a candidate of the Free Wills, was caught in the winter, whose speech against Stoiber was used by Duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out the shooting, but with ambitious municipal politics, they made an unmerciful short process.
CSU leaders now focus all their energy on how Beckstein stabilizes.
In the transitional period, it will also become an active role for Stoiber, who has so far organized lines from the background, the former prime minister of the country, and a former President of CSU called on 28 September the day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several irritable notes to the CDU, according to him, they would have earned much more support from the sister side.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for both CDU and Angel Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, does not have a role to play by joint forces.
According to Merkel, who was hard to hide her disappointment because of her fiasco, the loss of CSU position will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democrats continues.
The SPD achieved 18.6 per cent of the worst result in Bavaria since 1946.
Luschenko:opposite - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP came to the Belarusian Parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE), the illegalities that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the elections.
Although the 110-member legislative body of 10 million countries has been losing its opposition for ten years, the opposition united on behalf of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections really hoped that Lukashenko, who had left behind a change in the constitution in the elections with a debate in 2006 and the quarter to renew his presidential mandate, would "allow" several opposition MPs to appear in parliament this time.
The ODS has been leaving the boycott ever since.
In the background of the opposition, Russia was increasingly economically dependent on Belarus - which, in order to mitigate the impact of Russian imports of natural gas, has always taken credit and has also contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the country's own gas pipelines, have been given in Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where Belarus's political establishment as an anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-ranking policies do not provide entry permits.
On release it was pointed out earlier that in the evaluation of the pre-election campaign, the OSCE focused on positive moves and not on shortcomings - for example, on the ban of candidates for third opposition candidates.
On Monday, however, the OSCE report had already received an exemption from the campaign during which opposition candidates could not in fact appear in the press, especially since the opposition could not be present to count the votes.
At the same time, the opposition can only feel improved in the political system: political prisoners have been released for freedom and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow and in smaller confrontations, when it continues to refuse to recognise Georgia's remoted South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms the state's paper, has considered these two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps ahead and one step back, but the most important thing is that he started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter Alexandr Milinkevic.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain, even though "it is too much to be left to the insignificant parliament of a single member of the opposition".
In view of the opposition's results, he does not plan a protest, rather trying to deliver his message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution of barriers to local authorities, but I see that the change supports as many people as possible, even among older people," Milinkevic said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not consider it to be the right and officially the most supported group of pensioners.
"For the sake of the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security 'carrying silence' will collapse," Milinkevic says.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian observers have assessed the elections as democratic.
The Community's leading mission of independent states Sergei Lebedev, Russian news agency Rio Novosti, said that "people do not believe in words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of Belarusian volunteers.
Brunette: "From now on before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was set up by the reverse door on the arrival and departure of the employees.
From now on, however, this new measure will work against anointed people, against those who sneeze and then go to coffee at work.
The news against the Lenochs was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetto, and Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The reverse door - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services," explains the Minister.
"The new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
It's reformism," says Brunette.
We will complete the establishment of the Chigi Palace in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a common procedure with all workers and cooperation".
In short, no breakfast at work; no coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a regular cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher Professional School for Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister will finally announce that during three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people a year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more effective
"their payout dynamics – explained by the Minister – have doubled over the last 8-10 years in terms of the private sector and are far higher than inflation".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunette's decree in accordance with the request supported by Codacons.
"As the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures on the lower absence of work due to the disease – writes the Consumer Protection Association – the 'full-fledged' nation is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public officials who have gathered to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree."
Taru will be protested, in particular, against the exclusion of sickness allowances that depend on activities; the extension of the time period in which it is possible to check the time limits for monitoring visits and other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour attacks, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day there will be 2,500 work injuries in Italy, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain permanently disabled.
Inaill values confirm that in 2007, we have nearly 1,200 deaths due to work injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the decree, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly double deaths compared to murders.
In order to regain the attention of the institutions, social and information media about this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Work laid down for the second week of October.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic reports these days confirm how important the issue of job security is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmil, National Association for Frozen and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State shall express its deep concern for the continued joint effort on safety at work, on the protection of injured workers, on the assistance of victims' families and on the participation of the public."
"Naturally, a resounding 'suffering' has been raised, sincerely shared face-to-face with tragedies that cause their scope of controversy in the media and participation in public opinion, but daily reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating themselves in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt also a problem of sources: it is crucial to invest in education and information.
In particular, numerous initiatives are being taken in the field of education so that young people facing the world of work can gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to pay attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social importance, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed, on his part, that "as a result of the death of work damage creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state."
"As regards the dates of work impact, it seems that they show some positive turn, but it does not deny that the number of deaths caused by work losses is as alarming as it is," said President Anil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "decreasing effort" to lead to less attention, because it's just at the moment that attention stops, it's going to explode.
"We believe that in general there is still little to stop the problem of impacts and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to step up efforts in the training of workers, and immediately since school age."
"There is still a need for further effort - he added - in terms of communication and public opinion.
But there is mainly a need for greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli has finally declared that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of right to compensation for victims of work and "removal of supportive care", to which the system has been subject in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return the employee's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves should not depend on spontaneousness or giving time from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 players accused, exposed to risk
Listening to longer duration of loud music and using portable music devices as Mp3 players may cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's Communication from the European Commission, which is quoted in an official report published in Brussels, the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks Science, which has recently been established and identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view – we read in the notes – it turns out that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable musical instruments, weekly more than an hour a day and maintain a high-speed device, risk a lasting loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels may be able to damage their ears in an unmanageable way," admits Meglen Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – the leader continues – there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery in order to become fully effective and to keep pace with new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem as a result of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"The scientists – the executive officer of Eu – confirm that there is a need to be concerned and the European Commission will now examine, together with other members and parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be introduced and how better to protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the originator of which are portable musical instruments and similar devices".
At present, there is already a safety European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB but raises concerns about hearing damage which may be caused by excessive exposure to noise-like forms.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours per week, will currently exceed the limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a longer period of time risk a lasting loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be counted between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Germany leaves the Commission free movement for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", who met this morning in his new seat behind Caracall's spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the General Council evaluate the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" Campidoglia and his advisor Giannicho Alemanna.
"The Commission is completely independent and it includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to highlight Germany – will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually use the political decisions that remain with Giunta and the General Council.
It's not about any exchange of functions, it's just about trying to have a place where to process a large project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and will then be dissolved, because these institutions must have an exact time limit.
In June – the mayor announces – we present a strategic plan and use the work carried out by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
Anyone who accuses the Commission of negligence because its opinions will not be binding will be Germany's branch: "All depends on the work which the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are qualitative, like the Commission Attali's proposals, and I am sure of this in Rome, its benefits will be decisive.
Too often policy will pay for daily problems and emergencies that will arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is neither a surplus business nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not even be the euro and will serve to think and engage the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Germany, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, not a definite or unmoveable point, so that our city can allow an authentic rise to the level it needs, and to think of its future by a united spirit."
The future, which explains the mayor of Rome "will not only be limited to the current general border, but will look a lot further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of the capital, but also "including the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
One well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions deduced the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam".
The attacks against Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama is bold: he thinks he'll get to the highest position of the nation, who has all two governors everywhere and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of a clearly racial origin and they don't answer the question of volunteers: will it be a good president? And then we have research; they all say that Obama will win with a great leap.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the fall of the South United States, wrote a comment: At least once in the polling room we know well who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There's going to be one side of the American mentality that's been on the surface until the last moment.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves, if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of a black candidate.
However, despite all these considerations for the Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
The 1500 people asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with the miners into the ass.
The lives of 4,500 soldiers were seen in Iraq, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became for the majority of Bush's weakness.
Whoever comes to Georgia W will have to do a huge task.
The U.S. Economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many blame the internet, the "killer" press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the status of their profession and the assumption of the future.
For now, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the question was not openly stated that they had fewer concerns about confidentiality.
She doesn't feel isolated like she used to.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the shorts in the newsroom, in the rooms where editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists in question, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
The American journalist has a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press and executive seniors are convinced that a journalist in the national dimension is being issued a wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Pressed against the broadcaster.
It's not hard for reporters to see where the web goes.
More publishing takes the way to the Internet, which many look at as a "killer" press.
"Economic pressure", which journalists point out, has increased by 79%.
Five hundred of the journalists in question have admitted that they are turning to technology in hopes that their journalist "is doing something good".
The biggest failure in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – that means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "security of work."
The leaders who think they're losing their jobs over three years are at the national level 47%.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving at 30%.
As for "certain work" regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a vast nation like Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it is a question to take or leave.
Leaders get almost always huge salaries, and the editor can make ten thousand dollars a month without paying pensions and insurance.
As far as permitted, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until fifteen days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own knowledge, often get sick over the course of a year.
It's just a question of climate.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN ROME, DENAL OF THE COPPOL IS LAST IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Chamber of Criminals of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to refuse to introduce an entrepreneur with the realities of Daniel Coppola, who requested that he move from his city, Grottaferrats, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sale sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at its own expense, he received a release last week from his home prison, which was transformed into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the businesswoman could change the place of residence from the rural town to the capital.
However, according to the Court of Justice, this movement (against which it was expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence that he was accused.
Elity in Danger
This phenomenon occurred a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the saving plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a large part of the Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
They also confirm yesterday's New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is spreading the Republican side, which is increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, a smaller, closer to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is on the other hand a conservative, hostile towards "the one from Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the countries in the middle and south.
The soul that was arrogantly manifested by the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic crisis already shows: not only in the United States, but in the whole west and perhaps not here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be an acceleration of events that have been incubated for a long time, which are being abused in the new climate and ultimately based on light.
The first of these is the revitalisation, the extraordinary revitalisation of the market, the dual category of State-power in relation to certain renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is, of course, crisis with banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong links abroad, but in particular, include the budgets of people and families living in the only country, in the only country.
This created at the same time a political problem for those who drive it: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis is an economical world, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality appears to be substantially out of play or to have nothing to add: clear evidence has been given by the European Union, which is always divided between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot be decided on for one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each state, the rescue plans, the revitalization of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of the funds: when we get to the press, only the states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try everything in order.
And also their own necessary means and authorization to use them: two sources of irresponsible value, under certain circumstances, in which no market and no international organisation will ever be able to afford it to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on a state-national element, remains in full harmony with the growing importance of trying to contribute to one factor closely linked to it: territorial ownership.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the network, ever more sophisticated technology, imaterial, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already intended to rule the world, we realized from nothing that our future would have to face more and more things such as water, cereals, oil.
However, all things that would have been said can be moved from one place to another, but in any case, they are connected, absolutely, to a restricted space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more karat in his hand than he is and who has the pity that he lives in a place without grain, no oil and no water.
I'm getting to the second paper that predicts a crime.
Who is talking about territory, the state, the government, is talking inevitably about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, there seem to be two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, it is aware that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone who might be able to understand the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of discreditation towards existing leadership, in particular the economic one, which has proved to be equally unsatisfied and full of dark places.
Together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discreditability, impatience, feelings of inability and inadequacies that are trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems, however, that it is increasingly widespread in the broad masses of the population of belief that their actions are the same as the thoughts of popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of the word, that the elite has already exceeded its time and is harmful to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership is short-lived from the ground, but a strong movement to remove the ruling classes and traditional political order is manifested in unexpected "refuses" or unexpected changes in collective tastes in the last and most recent period, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the fall of Labourers in Britain, to the resistance of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps to do so the victory of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, they have increasingly problems understanding, so to represent, which, not since today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is once again strengthening, increasing, potentially exceeding the climate.
Prior to this, it would be excessive to talk about permanent "mass-resistance".
But we certainly cannot say that it means having a very open eye.
Super wall walk sticker
Overstep the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and walk on walls like Spiderman in the future.
This is an object of various U.S. research centres and now the four institutions are very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep the stochiogram body attached to the vertical wall with a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, the Acrono, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that has been invented by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called carbon tortoise tubes.
"We can imagine the base of the glue as a series of pipes set up as an organized pile of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of a gecko, covered with microscopic boys, which allow animals to ensure perfect landing.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new glue is ten times more powerful than the blades of these beaches and at the same time "it'll just slip away from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as a provisional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
I hope to walk down the walls like Spiderman? I hope so, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating use as a connection of electrical devices, because they are suffering from carbon tubes are heat and electrical energy guides.
Other applications could relate to aerial space engineering .
For the time being, no super heroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also dedicated to the research of a new glue.
In one article in the magazine American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving around the surface to maintain perfect attachment.
Drugs: never with juices
Attention to grape juice, orange juice and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are mainly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their diet changes to enhance or reduce their effectiveness with serious health effects.
For David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, highlighted the risk of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the use of certain drugs, at the 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new slogan is being launched: one glass of grape juice, orange juice and apple juice is sufficient to reduce the use of certain life-saving drugs to cancel their beneficial effects and expose patients’ health.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the toxic effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN RISK– The same Italian medical agency in the information bulletin two years ago advised doctors and patients not to underestimate the risks arising from this combination and to pay attention to what they drink in the event of taking medicines, such as Diazepam or methadone.
NOJEN GRAPEFRRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that are excreted.
A long list of effects of grapefruit and other juices.
From this point on, Michele Carruba, director of the Pharmacovigilance Department of the State University of Milan, said: "These findings are now immediately announced to the most diverse international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which will possibly set up and exchange information instructions.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you will get and if you attack something unclear, do not get upset, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” highlighted an expert for Ansa.
Nobel laureate Paul Krugmani
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of business models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is known as the New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms regarding the foreign, economic and political steps of the Bush administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, in the days of Enron, Krugman predicted in a comment published in the New York Times that the second event would be much more important than the first, in terms of consequences in the history of the United States.
A prediction that caused little controversy and that had been calculated for years, however, proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which the coups like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binho Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is "an economy of great importance", but also a popularist who has "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excess of Bush's liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It's Open Office.org 3.0, an open source package of personal products that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office will show a wide audience with different news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window will be added another, far more important, as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft plugin (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
The special features of some models are interesting, such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for e-way transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF file to the graphical execution model and keep the original look of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF Hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe format graphics and have tabular processor or text program properties.
Cooperation is an element that has achieved many improvements within application programs: it is perfectly possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts with changes, in the text programme, one color is assigned to each employee to comments in order to be clearer in the audit phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks the final result should be transferred.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, it is usually also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD may also be sent at home or at work on request.
And if the topic of unemployment can be an extension to households, it is the Open Office package that sits heavily on the business area, and can already be counted with the most diverse projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And there is no lack of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor that targets the replacement of Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw is finally a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5th million downloads, and when we consider that we are today almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this expected number can also be overcome.
Also the results of love are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: this is about Rakuzan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, third-class and winner of the best top shirt.
The report quoted L'Equipe's blog pages.
The 26th year of Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Cera, Epo third generation, after Italy Ricar Riccard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he is from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples are among those performed in recent weeks by laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positive on Cera, Rakušan will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on the positive impact of Kohl in the third generation confirms the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who announced that he had already reported the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26th year of Rakushan was placed on stage winners after Spanish Carlos Sastrem and American Cadel Evansem, also won a scored shirt from the best top.
IMIGRANTS:New York Times Is Italia Racist?
Italy "as the countries of immigrants have only become the preferred target of immigrants" adopted with resistance in the last house.
So it is in a long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdullah William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of dryers.
This case illustrates what the New York Times define as "a north paradox": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-circumvention thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Lego, which seeks to stop immigration and facilitates the harassment of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the pope and the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students of the victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, tenants' committees, a single room can be rented in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already reached such dimensions that the entire class of students lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices their families would have to bear – explains the leading offices for Sunia studies, Laura Mariani – a large demand from the students in this city has deformed the market in such a way that it has boosted the process of rising prices, which has also spread to residents".
In most cases, rental offers contain several infringements: free, unregistered, without limited rent, contracts linked to them.
For Sunji, there is a need for an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices through tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, for a single room from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) over the average value 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) up to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence there is one bed on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas near the university, there is a need for 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in central university areas (San Lorenzo, Bologna Square), they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
Values are slightly lower (EUR 550 per unit) in areas near other universities (Ostense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room of Prenestine, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there is a bed of EUR 300/450, a room of between EUR 400 and 600, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinica, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want for bed 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are certainly lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most common phenomenon for students from outside the European Union is rented, there is finally another anomaly: an increase of around 25-30% of the fee they want abroad compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities are ruining the historic halls
The cinematographic historical halls close in favor of multiplex.
"A city without cinema is like blind, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornator has been successful in documenting what is happening in large Italian urban centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the production of large multisalts in the suburbs and the subsequent collapse of monosalts in the central areas of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
Often the historical places are filled with memories," it is as if we had lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotion," says the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that was won by Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great jury price in Cannes, who told the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness of the way of life that the cinema lost forever.
The values obtained by Anek, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional type have been closed, and the highest account has been paid mainly to halls in the most important cities: 10 min in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 min in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 cinemas followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And by proving that the first responsible for their mediation is the introduction of multiplex, these three Italian regions have recorded the highest number of new cinemas: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“Italian procedure has developed abnormally” says Paolo Protti, President Anec, “it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing survive, because when one movie closes in the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then we do not even talk about insufficient funding for operators: the previous state debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
In support of the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million would be needed annually.’
An interesting case is the Bologna case, the first Italian town to worry about closures and which decided to find the east sign of the protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
The planned standards include tax impact steps in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to travel to a restricted transport zone and will have special parking prices.
"I like this initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of the Bologna introduction of other measures".
However, it is certain that in order to cope with the great power of multiplex, traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The protection of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a sure thing that convinced me to start "New Paradise Film", which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been going through the already closed Kingdom or Quirinal in the National Street, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at the writings of black work, I'll turn around on the other side."
Link between politics and Mafia group 'andrangethet, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the City Authority according to the interests of the Mafia group Pyromalli".
The accusations against the Mafia Directorate in Calabria against the mayor and the mayor of Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarn Carl Martellim, who was imprisoned this morning for his external cooperation with the Mafia organisation, are difficult.
In the railways also Gioacino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the chief, who is already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," states state representatives when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay counsel to Piromelli.
"This would allow the Mafia group – the judges write – to officially enter the city's authorities and thus make it easier for them to control and manage public administrations."
The president of the Agazio Loiero Regional Commission of California does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal sub-world are much in his country: "There are areas where the focus of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local policies that deal with the pressures of 'andranghets, heroes who are still uninhabited."
The arrests from this morning follow from the arrest of July last year , which the police showed that the Mafian group Piromalli received the final intervention .
Since the end of April last year - the City Council of Gioi Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, for example, the alleged link between organised crime and local administration - local politicians have been removed from the general government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of the dissolution of the Right-Central Coalition after the narrow election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the General Council to be dissolved.
He called for the responsibility of the then Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him of having everything politically based, but the judges in the prison regulation signed this morning explain that the Mafia Group has even grown so far that she has requested a change to the A3 Road Project.
From the other polls directed against Dal Torriono, the public prosecutor, announced "the desire to move the demands of the business operator, the representative of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Pyromallim and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the Mafia group."
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, currents are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the mirror of the wheels such as Chevron is now trying to stretch hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the sea's movements has been studied for over a hundred years, and research has intensified in the 1970s in connection with the first oil crisis.
When the oil price fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away. But now the ecological organization and the new oil price increase gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of waves of the sea.
This quantity would be a double energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
There are also streams and streams and streams.
The giants are attacking.
Enersis was a company that put on maritime energy, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy than on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he said a spokesperson for a company that is connected to the United States oil cycle in the economic daily Wall Street Journal – and they are thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permits from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the deployment of the project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that it is still oiling and President Bush has recently come up with a plan for a new spin.
In addition to Chevron, they follow the lead of marine energy and Verdan Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested so far, even though they are not fully known, they show an increasing interest among observers.
Technology, Keru needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology that's still at the beginning because they don't know what impact marine energy will have on the environment.
Meanwhile, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
However, more energy production needs to be used with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the color system that is connected to each other.
The force of wave, which moves with the battles up and down, is changed with the help of warriors and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these battles.
The pressure solves the turbine that supplies energy to the generator.
Energy gets on the shore with submarine cables.
Meanwhile, in the project phase, four devices of this type are waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdan Power is now producing energy for the shopping centre and parking lot using six pdmar turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the flow and flow causes the rotation of turbines that the generator is living through this rotational movement.
Vertant stated that they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
The waves, the flood and the flood.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential for flood and flood, they say in the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although it is an independent factor, the yield and the yield are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the wave, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
Just into the energy supply and flow of states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, and with other coastal states, they have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to 35 million dollars in 2009.
