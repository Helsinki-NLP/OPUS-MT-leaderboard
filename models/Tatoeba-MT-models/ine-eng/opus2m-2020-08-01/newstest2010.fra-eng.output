Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway for 26 hours and be the fourth American President of the story to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be handed over to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a program.
It will first visit the Nobel Institute, where it will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected it in October among 172 persons and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides for an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its final in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
He will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third one to be awarded the prize in the Committee's own body.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the time of the award.
The President does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he is receiving this prize by being a president who is waged a war in two countries at the moment.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics would forget to mention.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish crowns (about EUR 1.1 million).
He is counting on giving gifts to charity, but he has not yet decided which.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and the queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather slow at this price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he stated that it would be an "invitation to act".
A defender of the nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litomérice accused the president of the Association Society of Protectors of the nature of Litomérice of blackmail.
On several occasions last year, he appealed for several construction works and asked for the investor's money for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his call, said Alena Romová, spokesperson for the Litomérice police.
The president of the Society of the Protectors of the nature of Litoměrice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk for up to three years in prison.
Three of the wastes are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can choose their drinks packages, while in the villages of South Moravia, you fall on tri beds at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the right goods.
I don't mean that we wouldn't get rid of all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the age of three of the wastes not only because citizens can still choose only the paper, glass and PVC, but especially the number of items devoted to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It's all a science, which requires, above all, time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found for the moment is Moravia's place in front of Potrefena Husa.
Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but I don't think it's sacred.
Not to mention the fact that in other districts of the city this is not a safe one anymore.
So to end, many of my friends don't choose their waste.
By the way.
It's a trick for them to get to the wells.
I'm not surprised about them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to throw some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any Kounicova street color bands.
Luckily, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That's what the waste was about.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, right?!!
It's probably that ecology and alleged aestheticism are not too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country instead of buying some extra goods and offering the three more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to comfort my impression with official statistics after drawing a moment on the Internet.
According to ECO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the whole Moravia region of the South.
Parobek's budget has gone from retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or even civil servants may lack money for retirements, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interests of the State's debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenditures, retirements or sick leave. "It's only to solve the problems later, to mine the land," Janota said.
It should be noted that the interest to be paid on the money is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The State does not really have the choice to know where to get the money.
If it does not reduce social aid or expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who have now been raised to the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid of their retirement or sickness insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger end of the state - next year it will not miss 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will increase more and more quickly and with it, the costs of interest.
The State will need money to repay it and will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete the construction of railways and roads due to the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
It is mainly sections already decided and started that it is not possible to modify projects to possibly reduce costs.
Keep them as much as possible, which is not free or no longer.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major sites, and the collection of European funds is also at risk, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to settle the financial deficit very well - it will enable the ČEZ dividends (electric energy supplier and distributor), which the State has in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case a well with no background.
Last year, 18 billion have been deployed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the elimination of environmental damage, to supplement retirement accounts or to reserve pension reform.
In addition, this tool increases the real budget deficit of 5.7% of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communism and crime, even the housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we forgive an international procedure, we will have to pay it in any way, Janota notes.
The Minister will then have to save himself from the department's side or, in the worst case, to the government's budgetary reserve.
There is also a lack of one hundred million in the two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which has to be able to track online what is the cost of each administration.
The first step will begin in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
It's enough of a button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which primarily deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can change between them, you can distinguish them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinavas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for the Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is nothing but fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is currently working with European and American operators to test the virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
Snow poverty in the mountains haunts hotels
Desert tracks pose no problem only to lift-up operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to unwind free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our website.
Internet users travel offers, demand prices, but do not hesitate to book for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or noise in Christmas," said Martin Jandura, exploiting the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's dream in Špindlerův Mlýn, it's better not to hesitate.
If the economy is given priority and the quality of the accommodation is only then, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Špindler's hotel offers only one week's stay for New Year.
I think they're going to try to sit down for a while, but they're going to give up too, and they're going to take shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours Tourism Agency of Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting thing for the moment, it is not completely sold.
It still remains free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some less expensive last-minute Christmas stays," Ingtours Petr Schiefert's director said.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonosche, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are just as good as the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonosche.
People expect her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the contrary, the location of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of almost five percent.
There are a few places left for New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of Janvier of the Polish and February is also well sold," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at four-and-twenty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty in Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of the current employment.
February is a little lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow falls, interest in the stays in the Krkonosche will certainly grow further indicated by hotel manager Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoshe hotels should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will make more fresh and if there are any precipitation, they should be snowed in the mountain.
But then the time should warm up, Jiří Jakubský reports on the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
It becomes even funny, the effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wisdom, reproduced his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered to be simple.
When he ended up sweating his doctrine so eagerly, he found that he had copied it to the carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
I'm not happy to use in the text the phrase "as in Iraq" several times, he did not hesitate, which is, to use the title of the January 2007 Bush speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road ahead"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements in a Iraq consumed by civil war as being "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which contained recommendations from the campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful to the extent that newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq as a whole.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, as he said, objectively speaking, left his successor a much more favourable final situation than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
Again, the campaign commanders requested an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reticence of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he had at least destroyed the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to withdraw the promise of 5,000 more on the part of Europe, even though it was worth 10,000 at its origin.
What causes the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be its intention to remove Afghanistan's armies by 18 months and to complete all this process by three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it does.
Many doubt that an increase of half will produce the same fruits as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is reflected in the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leadership from day to day according to what they do.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain from the powder to the eye behind which the patriarchal ethnic relations will spread.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity regarding the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "soon state to act", which is the basic objective of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporary horizon of Obama's strategy makes par excellence his voluntaryism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it worse and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and beyond reality can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "soon return home" will bring a true miracle there.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it to be the indirect result of the US defeat.
NATO's last summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is heading towards the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a solution to the problem through military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghanistan's troops.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic return to the Afghan situation.
The only thing that remains for Obama is that it remains for three years until the presidential elections and therefore it remains long enough for it to be based on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash premiums
High-ranking employees from the U.S. Goldman Sachs bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
The actions may be withdrawn from the leaders if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus taking the lead in the effort to link payouts with long-term performances on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in detail, has he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after being turned aside almost $17 billion for prizes in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political topic in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was supposed to charge a single tax of 50 per cent of the bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields beyond physics
These are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received their compatriot Jack Szzotak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemical price was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a degree this year was physical.
Today, this award has been awarded to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCDs, which are currently based on all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (approximately EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The very expected Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward as it was only at the beginning of his journey and was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy, he added that in some situations the war was essential for peace, even though the price was high.
Minister Janota intends to resign. Klaus invited him to the Château
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who places his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the following year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the public finances crisis.
It was Presidential spokesperson Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his function on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a 163 billion-dollar deficit that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Deputies validated on Wednesday the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the salaries of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government objected to the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would increase the budget deficit indirectly.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left of one side, the government, Klaus and the right of the other side, which called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by the Members, deletes the package of economic measures passed by the Fischer government and that it considers it necessary to impose the State's debt.
Klaus, who is able to ratify the State Budget Act but is not obliged to do so, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that policies have long ignored the "serious problem" of the "reflexible deficit" of public finances.
In his view, there is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could improve if it could rely on a consensus of larger political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget was being spent and that the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dramatic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is expansive and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD has successfully ratified the State budget for the following year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the role played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu's new film will show the world a lot of things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American actor who was awarded Oscars, incarnates the film on Nelson Mandela's life, which is tireless to fight against the apartheid racist regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was a four-to-twenty-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate her in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally..
The 16-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in the Million Dollar Baby drama of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the box has, for example, incarcerated the leader of a movement against slavery became himself a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, even God in the film Evan Tout-Power but never someone else alive and so important for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African State man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work for the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invited is a Latin word that means invincible and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela recently elected knows that his country remains and is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the visitors to the world.
The South African team will end up progressing in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story on a large screen.
I had no other intention of playing this role than to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be in a hurry before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to close his hand.
I realized that when I closed your hand, I recovered your energy, it passed on and I had the impression of knowing how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I was asleep at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I have much bigger air in the film.'
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus received positive advice from the director of Eastwood, and even ambitions for the Oscars were discussed.
The review of films by the Daily Variety newspaper, Todd McCarthy, summed up his appreciation of these words: "It's a very good story, a very well realized film."
In film reviews on the Rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: the Russians were testing a shooting
A strangely unknown phenomenon of origin above Norway was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognized only yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the firing tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got hurt in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't steal"
A missile that doesn't fly but that shines
This 13th test was normally carried out at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the equipment again.
It is obviously the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be properly lit by a moving and immersed vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably a defective "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian shooting.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the shot were resistant and the avarice only touched the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failure on the first floor.
Although none of the tests were carried out without accracies, the Department of Defence's management considered that only six out of thirteen had failed.
This rate of success of almost fifty percent fills the generals of optimism and therefore they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei of a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with Cska Moscow at 51 years old
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a 51-year professional match.
The world's former champion, the Olympic champion and holder of Stanley Cup will hand in hand to his team of the Moscow CSK and will probably make his entry already during the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is now the president of the Cska.
After Denis Kuliash's wound, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is trained regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have some details on the form, says the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and obtained 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov Quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and one of the most successful.
In the colours of the Soviet Union, he won twice the gold at the Olympics, seven world championships, and won the Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he twice held Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Temple since 2001 of the renowned hockey.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancelled all additional hours
The Hyundai plant management of Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
It was precisely because of the frequent additional hours that the unions declared an emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday that worked this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, so that additional hours of volunteering have been proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a 400 Czech crown bonus to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posterium for the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays of the year-end indicated Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for breakfast.
Given that additional hours were the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management immediately decided to cancel all additional hours for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car factory employees were forced to work almost daily for two additional hours in more than eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between the management of the car plant and trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kucharæ said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in case they agreed on their claims and signed a joint document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees became self-conceived due to uninterrupted additional hours.
They also protested against the poor pay conditions and alleged harassment.
The management defended the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements for the production of cars.
In the announcement of the strike on Monday, trade unions also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who had ceased production.
Trade unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in additional hours to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started serial production last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also works on HIV "endurance" viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality is, in some cases, above the fact that the combination is not as intense about the current variants of the virus as are some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the present time.
However, the life of patients can be radically prolonged through a mixture of medicines that prevent the proliferation of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what is called resistant viruses on which medicines no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalliccarbons act on the responsible protein for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metal carbs are an assembly of copper, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the medicines used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their links to the proteins of the virus.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two layers of multiple walls are formed by the atoms of copper, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metallic atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus that betrays and resists.
HIV prosthesis is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV caused by HIV prosthesis, there would be no prosthesis of the virus.
If HIV prosthesis is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in tests as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of the metalocarbons is not as strong as on clinical medicinal products, but it does not affect the resistant versions against which the current medicinal products are often ineffective.
Therefore, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are interesting combinations to consider further to develop effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína Rézačová, director of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Discussion around the budget. The ODS takes over at Fischer, who defends himself.
The President of the ODS (Democrat Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the "offering" budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the statements of the Drastic Verdict ODS.
He says take time to analyze.
The spokesperson of the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether the House of Deputies supports the minority who is concerned about combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in his office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Neczas warned that the positions of the ODS and the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the budget on Wednesday for 2010, however, with proposals for changes of 12 billion crowns included in the left.
The House has increased money for employees' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government's complaint against the proposals of the Social Democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the Government's wishes as to what an amended budget is a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and worthlessness
Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still consider the current situation.
Neczac is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his duties in case of ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met with the Prime Minister on Monday after his passage to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he wondered if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment at the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečac believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect sickness insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, Topolánek pointed out in a textual communication from the United States.
He recalled that the vice-ministers of certain ministries are calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the fact that he is fighting the government deficit, "it is logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it will be on the agenda, then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer took the floor in the afternoon for a debate by the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has walked behind the Prime Minister's request.
Neczas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the modified budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic Members to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, we are not small children, has he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not received complaints from the Chairman of the Party to the House or in the country during the budgetary negotiations.
I didn't notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a round of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules, there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December certain less loaded or regional trains and will reinforce some others.
The total coverage of transport will decrease by two percent on the day of entry into force of the new schedules compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic tariffs and reduced tariffs.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino branch.
On the contrary, an express stopped serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague line - Písek - České Budějovice, the Prague direct line - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region of eight per cent, on the other hand Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague line - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague line - České Budějovice will be reduced to just a few days a week.
Among the major transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the time being, the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esco banner system, whose opening is possible due to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines towards the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main station (Praha Hlavní nadraží).
The ČD will introduce more SP Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will start in two hours.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava from December 13.
Bill this year for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion crowns to settle visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate at an altitude of almost three billion.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration has always been one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use an increase in prices of the vast majority of transport tickets.
Changes will only affect tickets for one day ČD Net and low-priced internet tickets eLiška.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend again on the journey, while until then it was valid between cities of a region at choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
More than 50 people are still detained by the Filipino rebels, children have been released
The rebels today have taken 75 people to the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed them, but who spoke at the origin of 65 otges only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The settlement took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 rebels were reported to have used hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the army branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the offenders for violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The Mortal Act was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested as a result of suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential line of the Ampatuan.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the government of the Philippines on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen by Mandela himself years ago to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was assigned to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the halls, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
With his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvesu in South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Prize for Peace next to Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on the one hand fully prepared for the world Cup of football, and on the other, because the media is motivated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the people of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are now rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations that have been issued to the main roles in which Hollywood stars "go away".
However, Morgan Freeman is proud of the film by retaking his own terms.
I've dreamed of this role for years and I've been well prepared.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally to be able - as we say - to recover his energy, did he say at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but this concerns each individual has added.
Carrying the mail from the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people is dedicated to the South African human rights defender during his term of office.
Morgan Freeman therefore tried during the film to collect two racial groups from a long-standing divided population, and also Nelson Mandela in 1995 was among the clothes of the South African team on the world’s cutting hair, which South Africa had won at the time.
Mandela had been long ovated for fourteen years mainly from the white public and had been recognized by the white population in South Africa.
Let's hope that the football championship will be able to reunite people into one nation, said Rugby Chester Williams, who was the only "black" player of the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the trend in South Africa will improve.
However, South African whites are skeptical as recently entrusted to LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire struck in the morning a transformer from the company Čeps of the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukaš Marvan, spokesperson for the firemen of Ustí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume themselves, but they reviewed their opinion and set fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to Pavla Mandátova's spokesman, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the entire transmission.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is gone.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a nine.
She added that in ten years of activity, Čeps had no knowledge of anything similar and that incidents of this kind were isolated.
The electricity supply has not been interrupted, says ČEZ's spokesperson for the Bohema of the North Soňa Holingerova Hendrichova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution positions with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport sets to distribution sets and lines of 4339 kilometers long.
Jancura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today a complaint for defamation against three democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Haszek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tessarík.
Jancura reported it in twenty minutes of Radiojournal.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions have concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while only one offer was made for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways than what is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So there's nothing left for us to defend.
This is in exchange for complaints about the Student Agency, Jancura said in the Radio Journal.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no region had been in agreement with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Haszek considers that Mr Jancura's complaint submission is the result of his media show that serves him as a free publicity for his company and his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jancura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Haszek
Jančura has already reported last week that he will invest some millions of crowns in advertising that will mention the unfavourable actions of the regions.
He told Radiojournal that he had interrupted the campaign after Christmas and that he wanted to resume it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign would focus on corruption in a broad sense.
Jancura started her campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for a order of approximately 150 billion crowns, without making an offer.
According to Jancura, such an action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to Jancura threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who this is, but I will not say his name, Jancura said today in Radiojournal.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free of charge and optional
Vaccination against Pneumococcals will reverse the old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute has already defined for vaccines the maximum prices that will be paid for sickness insurance.
Experts are also clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcals.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination has started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid on their own.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, about a quarter of families volunteered to immunize their children against pneumococcals.
However, the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance costs 300 to 450,000 crowns at vaccine doses.
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 crowns a year for the entire vaccination of children.
The re-vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the intestines and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age were caused by Pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced the re-vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible future vaccination obligation.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský Association indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcals.
At an international conference in which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied that we had an optional vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that we need to follow now, said Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against Pneumococcals.
We will not consider it at all for the moment, said his spokesperson Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Paediatric Society, admits that a voluntary vaccination is based on its defects.
However, if all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the renewal of vaccinations could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making optional vaccination" says Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that from next year, more than 80 percent of the new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break in the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
However, this is linked to the concerns of the practitioners' pediatricians, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "deduction the amounts of sickness insurance".
Doctors will thus have to buy the products and expect insurance to be refunded.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest, individually, nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Vol de muse"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while loading 90 tables in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used mechanical skin to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, aged 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) press agency.
AP quoted a police officer as saying that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claimed that his father had been authorized "to enter the museum by any means to transport the tables into a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refused to grant such an authorization, the agency said.
Labour advocates an increase in budgetary tax.
Ministers advocated an increase in the tax and reductions in the expenditures announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism of opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "was missing" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction of the deficit by deferring its decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor was also attracted to fraud by attacking low wages and middle wages.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public salaries from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession that they were not responsible for and warned that "problems" were announced.
The reduction in social insurance - which will bring about GBP 3 billion a year - has put the world of companies in anger, because it considers it a tax on jobs while the goal should be a relaunch of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
Main points of the pre-budget report
Social insurance will continue to increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will decrease even more than 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in corporation tax on profits for small companies has been abandoned
Discounts of electric cars and windmills
Increase in pensions by 2.5 per cent
According to Treasury estimates, a person who wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person who wins 40,000 GBP per year will lose 190 GBP, while a person who wins 10,000 GBP per year will gain 110 GBP more.
Ministers stated that their goal of reducing the deficit by half before 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, rejected an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in expenditure was a "water drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important: they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would begin at the end of the year.
However, the Labour Forecasts on Economic Growth - which will affect the amount it will need to borrow and the rate at which the deficit will be met - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise its first figures.
In his speech, he stated that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - worse than the fall of 3.5% predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed opportunity"'
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the Labour "debt crisis" claimed that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, added, "cynically" to difficult choices until after the elections - which is due in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary of the ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Force stresses that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from further reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals, which would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But Lib Dems stated that the money collected by increasing taxes and reducing expenditures would be used to support expenditures in the coming year rather than to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "constructed on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC Political Editor, said that the schedule of ads - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda charges, since the money was simply recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Force stresses that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers had not published expenditure details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to feel in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Estudes Fiscales) has stated that the Chancellor's figures involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only delayed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report.
The FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters, suspected of extremist links.
Men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan, told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the United States of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani descent, one Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and what conditions they are detained under," said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, spokesperson for the FBI, said that the agency had been aware of the arrests and that it was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if it is true that students are missing," she said.
Pakistan's embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of them' uncles.
She said that the house had already been monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against arrested men.
The Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States should " work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been taken away from their home by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
the report presents "repeatations of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
A dozen were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, who is from the BBC in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"Failure confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been charged with 'Working with Facebook networks' and protested against election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and consciousness, said Amnesty.
In August, the missing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied charges of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an old detainee who said he had been in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and the government's response, but she said that the mandate and powers of these agencies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested during the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski trails built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn Bristol's site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park (A track in the park) has attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small tramp was ahead of a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a medical student in his fourth year, said that the view of the high track was magnificent but that it was quite frightening.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining in contrabas.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best voltages - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's festival, the snow will be left at the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French don't like the crowd" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and concerned the country for over 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book by Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious picture.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for Muslims 5m-6m.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the womb (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a bank system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They do not lead the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their lawyers from a Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who are now a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered to what extent French politicians (and the guardian intellectual elite so virulent of laity) were really engaged in pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not harmed, compared with Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than increasing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The Darkest View of the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their village.
In "On a thin ice layer", Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Aware of the history and complex policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by chasing white bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old who didn't want to fight that point of his moustache, is definitely a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming next to their mother, just killed, were caught and sent into zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually a millionth of the area needed for a free adult.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the something that was pushing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis related the stories of other writers and historians and often referred to the threat of species survival hunters.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Indians in Motoski use powerful firefighting rifles to chase their gear.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of the hunt that the ice will remain as long as possible.
In his new book, "After Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and clear summary of Arctic science and an insight into what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither amphibians nor oceanographers can accurately relate to the rate of change.
You don't have to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneer trips provided the first information on the source of the iceberg.
The Underseas of the Cold War then mapped the relief changes in the Underworld.
Satellite surveillance and iceberg probes are of great help, but the biggest work is done by tough men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by the water-sweetened ice-flakes.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn."
Des Marines, among the 6,000 people who have deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The first class of De'Angelo Robinson, 19 years old, made a seven-hour bus trip to place a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery, this day was dedicated to saluting men and women who one day were in their place.
Within a few months, from where we will be sent, we may be in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the tombs of the veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morril and his wife Karen make a trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of the 93 United Airlines flight in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to purchase and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in honor of her husband, a retired career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It's a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Emitouflewed in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the palm trees and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers have said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding hands, wearing the crowns of fresh pine on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red papillo node on top.
Nearly there was silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan were inhumanized.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark humour of the current wars increased the area.
Individuals would cry without hiding, others would pray, and families and friends would support themselves in the cold.
Some read aloud the names recorded in the stone while others were looking to see the small black and white information cards, embedded in the wet earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She was a member of Zanesfield, Ohio, and had spent eight hours coming to collect on the grave of Sergeant Gunney David Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget about what we're free of... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who distributed mobile phones and portable computers in the country, and claimed the services of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana try to have access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The precise charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husband and wife are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but his authorizations have always been refused.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a "sweet" approach to improve relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and desired consumer goods in a country or an average employee's salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for such crimes as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, a press associate with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a major mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch program, who recently published a severe report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his sick elderly brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused was often arrested, tried and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often reacted negatively to the United States, when the two countries started a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified an organization that was supposed to prepare a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would remove an important network of terrorists recruiting to search for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing an insurgent hidden personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video website.
Upon arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them join the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, the home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the commanders of al-Qaida that these men were not participating in the CIA's conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the prohibited mountains of the northeast, became a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed the condition of keeping the anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to get entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruits in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists in identifying those in whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US secret services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barricades, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may appear to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to be more and more careful, in the past few years, in the choice of people they accept because US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following his recruitment model than so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly online.
Tens of thousands of protestors in Copenhagen demand an "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets here on Saturday asking for more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit up a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day that few things happened during the United Nations-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists walked from the city, deploying maps in English saying, "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring, "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the Danish model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native country, Peru, opened her eyes to the problems that must be faced by the country due to the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That is one of the reasons why I have decided to join the great march -- to make the word pass and to call on world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
The police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said she had arrested 19 people for wearing a mask or having pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity because of its involvement in climate discussions, activists who wore black masks and clothes lit several explosives near the main canal of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by several departments.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first fired, then followed by "a few large explosions".
Within the Palais des Congresses, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk all afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to raise the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, a representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it's something I didn't know.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "Because the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that the walk might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal the differences between races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics provided good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grades 4 and 5 (cm1-cm2) are much larger progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures of the National Assessment of Education Progress (National Assessment of Education Progress) are the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites on both local and national levels.
The average results of the white children of Grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased, over the last two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American class friends have only increased from three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling from only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean white result was not included in the results of the tests because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a period of six years is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between the black and white grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some of the District's defenders expressed concern that the increase observed by the Director of Education Group Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate) was driven by white students who were already good.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the education of the District.
I do not miss one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic Aparence), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city's middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what scares us is that we don't spend enough time and energy on our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at the final-class students of the elementary and early college cycle who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school course and are rather late for their friends.
Every day, the program of mathematics, for the Kindergarten (Maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real life games and experiences, as they were established in the District by former head Cliftford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class," Rhee said.
Others believe that NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher at Berkeley University in California who is studying the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest districts of Washington.
This target can also have political implications that generate this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success was the length of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with the Charter Schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, that he considers a " starting point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long syllable.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, is down and has a moment in sight of white columns, brick facades and green hair.
Graciela's parents could only finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where the tuition costs are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less than that of a new student who was impressed than an enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, while the guide led them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says dreamy, when she is told the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still widespread for the large number of American children born of Hispanic immigrant parents who have left high school where they have become parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will enable them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a Hispanic of the "second generation" over fifty his studies at the high school -- a remarkable success if you consider that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them in Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without having finished the high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they are opening the way for the next generations to play an important role in the country's work.
Researchers studying battalions claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to the university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, at any time, no intervention will help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support for these children, from maternal to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared for you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparatory programs that start when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Iraqi Oil receives agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two trials that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and Europe's oil companies are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, with the exception of decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are divided into only two of the 10 fields involved.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second round that began on Friday.
The only one who had a fill has lost.
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the field of auctions in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, they were Asian and European companies that opened the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum forum, a website for information on the Internet.
It will take a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability, while American military troops withdraw, have stopped American oil companies, preventing them from becoming more forceful in Iraq, which has the world's third largest crude oil reserve, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who have maintained strong ties with the Ministry of Iraqi Oil and have provided their technical advice, have been given empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has concluded more contracts than other companies and is divided with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, Assam Jihad, spokesperson for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and will meet its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit tenders made offers that were then compared to the fare per barrel that the department agreed to pay to justify production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, hitting along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, said on Friday of the US anti-spionage authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the Anarchic Tribal Border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civil secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
The authorities said that the suspected local militants rushed on site and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally decapitated bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two American anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of the responsible military organizers of al-Qaida who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, he said one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic signs of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. representative said that Somalia had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the great American public, but this does not reduce the threat he poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second leader of the Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal zone, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to the figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability, while also seemingly killing suspected informants, the site states.
United Nations special envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he was going to resign from his post in March at the end of a turbulent mandate with widespread allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide takes place when Obama has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States schedule for withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send a good signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a Kabul phone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition to Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but that he would simply comply with his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been quoted; it is an Italo-Switzerlandn citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and of rejecting evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked for -- "were detrimental to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of the elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the United Nations Responsibilities to allow their successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money was spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy United Nations recruitment regulations were creating opportunities for new talents.
The United Nations rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must be subject to additional sanctions
The Secretary for Defence, Robert M. Gates, said on Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in nuclear-related talks.
Gates, speaking in front of a camp of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a one-week visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramaticized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a failure.
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I have learned something in Iraq in the last six years, it is the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama Administration considers a set of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians on the street.
He stated that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would be in fact less secure with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the Administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the United Nations Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In Geneva's talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his rich uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has promoted such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and to make time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have been far from trying to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
I sincerely believe that Iran's rediscovery against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October has moved the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they did not consider, in terms of further significant sanctions against the Iranians, stated Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "more sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded claims" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue its talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday morning, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich oil region of Kurdish in order to defeat the troopers in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are ongoing tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in the US plan to reduce the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the suspension. The American authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
In ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up in an exhibition of propaganda telling them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "An extra baby, it's an extra grave."
They learned so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and has an 8-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children with well-known games and spells, called "the little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when policy was implemented.
The population distribution is expected to expand from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is still worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, stated that fertile couples should have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of work in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "so old - but not as rich - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" have said.
Progressive attenuation
As drafted in the Constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is, no doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination at the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend towards its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities forced pregnant women from a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys - girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually adopted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they adopted many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city's government has dispatched family planning and volunteers to meet couples at their home and slide prospectors at their door.
It has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planning manager, the response was disappointing.
Defective response
Although those in charge of a rural town in Shanghai town said that they had seen an increase in requests for couples seeking a second child after the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
The leaders of Shanghai, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the Municipality of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people do not want to have more children.
They want to have their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said that they would worship two children and that they were legally authorized there.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and the life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Westerns mistakenly believe that the policy of the single child is a problem of rights, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months from the first child of the couple.
True, we're stealing the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was herself. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit of everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says this more sharply.
For couples working in two middle classes, which lower the birth rate, he said, it is necessary to be selfish rather to succeed.
The 20 or 30-year-olds grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even one child asks for a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best maternal."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft emission reduction plans
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations, which has so far been characterized by disorganized tasks and mutual recriminations, came under the light of Friday's disaster, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations with most of the burden, in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important advance in the negotiations that are lacking time, with more than 100 world leaders coming next week to Copenhagen.
Written by a United Nations special working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate warming, in the short term and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequiyt, Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who produced six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete image".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement whereby industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also resumed negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal alterations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration became more harsh to China than Bush's administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the US chief negotiator, either missing "good sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to combat climate warming.
With the future economic trajectorys of the major world powers at stake, both in the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States struggling with their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist on the fact that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, Ulate said, which is also Advisor on the Climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries were more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, indicating that they would continue to put pressure on a treaty legally binding in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants said that negotiations would lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, meeting 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of small island states "has put political pressure on the whole political process", in part because they are now unified and they ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in the forum before the heads of government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Indian Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend house-to-house meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be examined during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people come in and out of the Congress Palace every day -- guitar activists present night performances that mock, betray, and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all major ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are going to the Grand Court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the World Conservation Policy International.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first 225 km/h train will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 p.m. on Monday morning, a sifflet blow will be lost at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed runway will reach 225 km/h, while it will start from Ashford, in Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin train outside London.
It hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will link the major conurbations between the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburbs, the length of business travel will be much less and the passage of the plane and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhered to this project.
But the ten billion books needed to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle and the fear of danger to the environment are likely to slow down the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the network at high speed.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in five metres from the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be designed up to 25 metres from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The privileged options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennins in Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a railway professional.
When this is completed, the time of travel between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours for 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour's journey at present.
The proposals will allow you to travel to 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains of 400 m long and capable of transporting 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the network at high speed.
The railway industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to travel off high-speed lines on the existing railways in northern Birmingham, preserving travel periods between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a passage of aircraft to the train, which is a reference point for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers repay the GBP 75,000 loan for Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his home of his constituency.
The party's responsibility, which was backed up by David Cameron to complain that the members of the parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of GBP 75,000 to build a chain extension to his second house in Rutland.
Additional interests were allowed to be paid, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out an inspection of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in the district of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office says that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the Communities on its pre-financing arrangements.
The Committee has released him in the last month of any charge of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the loan of GBP 271,406 of his London property to the house of his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of loan interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard interest rate variable RBS rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of phantom cabinet in September, after a journalist under cover filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's national now, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "my..."
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked more sacredly, but I didn't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as oil negotiator, began to explain his expenses in May, after it had appeared that he had requested thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the cost office that this could "be considered excessive".
An activist crossed a £hole in M Duncan's hair to protest after it was revealed that he had requested GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan, last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, both approved by the cost office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with breaking or developing or using the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It could not be more clear or simpler."
Faithful, come all see Brighton's Adventure schedule
Brighton beach cabins have found a new means of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Adventure calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant TV marketing assistant at Hove, is an unremunerated priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the beach cabin Adventure calendar came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to claim an ambitious and binding agreement on combating climate warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police conducted hundreds of interviews.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, appeared in the cold in the Danish capital, in the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is responsible for reaching an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization of climate across the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the court, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, broke down the windows with smashes and hammers, a journalist from the AFP found.
Anti-emetic police officers were immediately arrested without a home.
Overall, the police announced the involvement of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultraviolent groups that were illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were called "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were always held in the street on Saturday night "maintained and kept in position despite extreme cold".
Parliament's party, the court, rather a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without attempting to penetrate it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the booths with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters came in and out of Europe's major cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of Earth, who intended to form "married blues" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we descend into the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt for the South, Lidy Nacpil, a campaigner from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen, explained.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, we have estimated the benno singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, watercourses where we can walk like we had never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alterdialyst movement approached environmental organizations.
The French Member José Bové, a figure of alternativeism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no struggle between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which covers many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the call for protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down in the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, showed up in red, booming bands of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, meetings of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand an energetic action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (est).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Abkhazia separatist elected its president, Georgia denouncing a "face"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "face".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war to control South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17.00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to the representatives of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates in high school, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili, "regrete that Abkhazia falls under the total occupation of Russia", said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who said he voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region to the sour landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the President and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located a little around this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials to monitor the vote.
We, the people of Abkhaz, are grateful, did he say during a small ceremony, speaking of Moscow's support, in particular the decision to acknowledge Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered by raising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements with Moscow last year, as the one that gave Russia control over the abkhhazes railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people bought Saturdays around the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the one hand, called on nearly 700 people in addition to an impressive demonstration.
Thirty-one thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts up to 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament's side, the Globally Good Child Court, has taken the lead of the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped at about 500 metres from the center, without attempting to penetrate.
A scene had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a guard to the booths with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cap, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after leaving the court, a group of several hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, brick and hammers, broke the windows, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emetic police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened without a home, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the interception of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolent groups that had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was wounded by a man and four cars on fire near a squadron, which led to the shooting of twenty people, according to the police.
We had in mind the extremist groups, had prevented the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order's forces were turning up in the sky.
Most of the demonstrators, who came in and out of the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, for the most part in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of Earth, who intended to form "married blues" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we descend into the streets to seek compensation for the ecological debt for the South, Lidy Nacpil, a campaigner from the South Coalition Jubilee in Copenhagen, explained.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, we have estimated the benno singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are watercourses where we can walk when we've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alterdialyst movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alternativeism, told the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cut between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, including the Danish monk Helena Christensen, the former United Nations Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which covers many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had given the call for protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had come down in the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for most of the time, showed, dressed in red and bananas, boasting solar energy in front of the mayor of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, meetings of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (est).

Geo-history strengthened the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" by the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in a scientific terminal.
Now, the first students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "you have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S branch is no longer a scientific branch" but "largely, it concentrates the best students".
ES and L can't remain S's branches, he continues, pointing out further: "I haven't heard a lot of historians and intellectuals become angry about the absence of terminal history-geographics in technologically high schools."
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in Humanity revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) of French denied the government's intention to eliminate the mandatory teaching of the history and geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and certain right choices.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to delete the philosophy of terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest against the project, which they considered to be sacrificing the teaching training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an acceptability test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their teaching ability, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will follow internships during the year M2 and will be a first year in front of students as trainees.
If you add all the courses proposed before the competition, you will already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, has it continued.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to delete the school card "by 2012".
In Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince you about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: it was the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by the Senior Normal School of Ulm Street, raised on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also at the Nobel Peace Prize, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, found a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that caught people and gave them a desire to know more about it, explained in the margins of the Eduard Hannezo conference, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day who draws his name from that given by the students to the fish in the school pool.
Twenty participants were selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side.
Regarding climate warming, "you can talk for hours, but you can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, has he stressed, hoping that the auditors will hold that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos taken from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Payment delays: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison supervisors called on Friday to "general mobilization" to demand payment by the end of the year of the awards and extra hours for which payment was made in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penalty (2nd Union of Oversights) asked staff who would not be in service to appear in front of and "block" prisons on Tuesday morning to "denominate the theft of their dues".
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them "to meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "good and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, nights, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first supervisory union, the Federal Autonomous Union of Penitentiaries (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring up discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that additional hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellor stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent an e-mail to the trade unions of supervisors to ensure that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff to operate and modernise our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which is due to a poor assessment of the number of additional hours, does not reproduce in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be lost, except for management staff who receive the famous premium of functions and objectives, has deplore Ufap/Unsa, for which "the budgetary constraints have a good back."
It is a pure scandal, the interregional FO union of Marseilles has become angry, announcing its decision to boycott to the new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same for additional hours, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and our missions are increased without increasing our staff, it is more than regret to dare to take over the staff's money, the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad lots than others.
But the account is not there in any way, according to Ufap's secretary-general, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "sweeter tricks" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, has entrusted the "papesse" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give more things than I get."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday night on the ABC chain, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the little four-legged partner of the family will be on the side.
The Christmas Father also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "surely" have a gift, according to the extracts of the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama lied to her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he received: "Of course not, I offered you some nice gifts last year," she took the president.
Was it absolutely forced to give up before we could replay with humor by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace from the finger: "Who offered you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast, in the relaxed atmosphere, with Barack Obama's famous cheerleader who was a staunch supporter during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his father Kenyan had rarely seen offered him to Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only a long time ago in my life that I realized it was him who gave me this balloon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I didn't really know how to organize a house, so I aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little house of dolls, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles because of significant injuries after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to its surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Los Angeles hospital after American doctors had found "the injury resulting from the operation" of the discal hernia in Paris on 26 November, reported his press service in Paris, stating that these injuries "needed a repair operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday would have been immersed in an artificial coma to avoid "pains and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources" no drain would have been put after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the International Park Monceau clinic for this discal hernie.
The intervention, programmed for several days, had been practiced by neurosurgian Stefane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL information.
As a result of his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for a subsequent infection with the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close to Johnny Hallyday, thought Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but made sure he didn't "no concern" for the rocker, which is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a cannery because 12 hours after such an operation, it's not playable, Eddie Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "responsibly responded to antibiotics" and that the infection was "enduated".
Mr. Camus also said that he had been with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, in general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated with a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been reported. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, its surroundings even had to detract from a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small bass: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalled in the World Championships in large bass, won an international title on Thursday on a particular distance, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in small bass in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time has seen only three records of the world beat while waiting for a departure.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 Nails and the other by Russia in relays 4x50 m 4 Nails.
A regret for Bousquet, who was looking forward to the 50 m free world record, with the mark in large bassin (20.94).
On one of the two queens of the swimming distance, the 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old French who was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet moved ahead with the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had planned.
We can always dream better and at the same time, I said if the world record was at my disposal, I was going to try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their era in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not been used this time in Germany Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in large bass this summer in Rome, records from the world to the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he held on 400 m of free swimming (3:32.77) but was nevertheless imposed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola adjudicated 1.5 million USD
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging, in particular, to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, clearly above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This two - foot - long [63 cm] panel, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and baccantants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," AFP explained Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still under way, but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have the most satisfied so far, has indicated to the AFP a spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abnerthy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained close to 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and then appeared subsequently with French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made an element of his bathroom in his special Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council prior to the accession to the power of the Marshall Petin.
There was still a shadow zone of fifty years.
By exploring the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Eile Zola succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresh "Rogon-Macquart".
Attempted to leave Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer on its territory of the late President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who had refused to behave solely by the Putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, it seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived to Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the plane of the Mexican government departed to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "dismiss" and to ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a free conduct.
But the dehu president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of the guest state.
The Putschist government "has experienced a new failure wanting me to give up my position (...), they wanted me to resign," Mr. Zelaya said on Thursday to the Globe radio, which he often expresses himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some deals with the late president, who has been refugees at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's embassy has submitted us a request for extra-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, the Minister of the Interior of the Putschist Government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday at Honduran Radio HRN.
I did not ask for asylum in any country, had responded Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras would have to become the president of the people of Honduras, he had stressed.
The outgoing speakers of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized the President's party on Wednesday, who had come to gather around the Brazilian Embassy, where the military had strengthened their seat.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this government with regard to international standards, has it considered.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been reversed on 28 June, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21st and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he does, he will be arrested for the "high treason" crime of which he is accused of justice, according to the Putschist government.
Putschiste President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial vote recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street mounts, the US trade balance feeds on optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, the US trade balance figures testify to the resumption of both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405,83 points, and the Nasdaq , to dominant technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 extended index was attributed 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news coming from different economics, Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial, has been judged.
But this remains anecdotal, has it cooled down, considering that the market focused on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the American trade balance, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts were expecting the opposite of an increase in the deficit.
The imports that exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the US' major trading partners, Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment enrolments in the United States have increased against all expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has dropped to the lowest in a year", said Scott Marcoouller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The mandatory market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Treasury debt performance rose to 3,482 per cent against 3,423 per cent on Tuesday night and 30-year-old debt to 4,492 per cent against 4,408 per cent on guard.
Cuba: hundreds of power supporters are "White Ladies"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government concurred Thursday of wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were called.
A quarter of "White Women", married or close to political prisoners, were accused in the street by supporters of the Raul Castro government as they marched to the centre of the capital to claim the release of political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP noted.
The Yankees!, "merceners!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" were scandalous, the raised point, the supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came "to ensure their protection".
The guard, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, they were called by civil police officers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Policemen have forced dissidents into civilian vehicles who have been accused by government supporters, according to this journalist.
Dissident interpolations in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
The European Parliament's Sakharov Prize winners in 2005, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissident, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained under the locks.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "merceners" or "agents" at the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuba's television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government militants against "con-revolutionarys".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
An officer kills an octogen on the knife and kills 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed man with two knives killed an octogeneist and injured five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of flu, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have hit two knives and for unspecified reasons, an octogenaire, in or in front of a pharmacy of the 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, had learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Grief injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union officer of the Alliance, died at the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or before this same pharmacy, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged 30 years, was intertwined and injured.
The first two victims, severely injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogeneic suffocated.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently touched, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then had a malaise and would have been hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then run away in the street, still bubbling Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passersby, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the last strike.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried in the cross behind his back, explained on the spot a union officer of the Alliance in the Upper Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passersby, including young people, according to evidence collected by the AFP, tried to control the force.
I've seen a 30-year-old guy with a green dress.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was expensive, reported Alberto, server of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
At the height of No.61, two municipal policemen, their leaders, tried to intercept the armed man and were wounded by punches, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many trades.
Passers came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important abdominal wound, told Frédéric Allion, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later a second person arrived 30 years later, injured with a knife.
They're national police officers who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Parquet seized the departmental judicial police service of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The officer was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out hospitalization.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to take him to the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forces of this species whose forces decouple under the influence of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again claims abandonment of prosecution
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed that he was in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that he had abandoned his client, currently being assigned to live in Switzerland for a case of death of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced three judges in the court of appeal in the second district of California for serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I claim that the charges were dropped here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behavior of the judge responsible for the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "false" with the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel claimed the holding of a trial, which would enable him to present the evidence of his argument.
The charge had, on its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never laid foot in the United States since.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the County of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, thus stated that Roman Polanski "should be here to appear at the hearing".
In this case, we want to send the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, what is possible to escape?, Mrs. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for favor in court, while contempting her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one asking to abandon the proceedings against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the persecution.
Recalling that his client no longer supports being harassed at every rebonding of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure has been fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to live in his Gstaad chalet, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends with no direction, blocked by the increase of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between indicators better than expected in the United States and the dollar increase: Dow Jones won 0.63% but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is raised from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the Nasdaq , which is technologically dominant, has left 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 extended index progressed from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case by the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "helped to improve the market's opinion on the solidity of economic recovery", analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of membership and much more than expected.
In addition, the confidence of American consumers rose significantly in December to 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, at the top of two months in front of the euro, which "has pushed down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The mandatory market has fallen.
The 10-year-old Treasury debt performance rose to 3,540 per cent against 3,482 per cent on Wednesday night and the 30-year-old debt to 4,497 per cent against 4,492 per cent on guard.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of peripel throughout South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are ready to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already scrapped their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Sports Miss or Miss top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and the Cap, was amazing.
I've seen so many things and lived so many experiences, Miss Sierra Leone exclaims.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give up my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the summer heat.
For young Russia, its second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of the landscapes to cut the blow in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
Indian Poja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presents to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming Bollywood stars.
It is the dream of any woman to be crowned the most beautiful of the world, but it is only the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a big smile.
According to organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional and of course in bathrobe.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a director of Miss World Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it was able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, but this time on bicycle, and enjoyed local cuisine.
In exceptional circumstances, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who closed their hands.
Not current for a head of state, note Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will no doubt remain the lucky match in Cape (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote a little more event.
I've been with people I never thought I could get close.
I'm definitely coming back for the World-2010, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday at Los Angeles airport where he was supposed to go to the head of his father's hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's very good, he told the press David Hallyday on his departure from the plane that took him to Paris shortly after 1 p.m. (21 p.m. GMT).
The son of the singer, the relaxed air, assured him that he would go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection with the operation of a discelle hernie on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "put into artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment", the press service reported.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for a subsequent infection with the operation of a discelle hernie on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated on Wednesday night to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from the intervention.
His wife Laettia went to the French high school on Friday morning in Los Angeles, where their daughter Jade, to attend a school show, found a photographer from the AFP.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitie-Salpätrière Hospital, Yves Catone, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday to the singer.
The producer has violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgian who operated the singer at the Monceau International Park Clinic in Paris on 26 November.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were different, Mr. Camus said.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "going too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this on-line doctor who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and that it was drugging me, since I myself had two discal hernies, did he add?
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "drainless, nothing" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before his death in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor of sulphurous reputation, condemned several times by justice, in cases of medical responsibility, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" pursuing "regularly" before the Council of the Order, which is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain," he added.
In any event, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be between parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8th (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, Mr. Camus said.
The UDF association increases tone and sums up the New Centre to no longer use its seal
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, responded on Friday to OPA's attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, leaving it to remain unused on any media, subject to judicial proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claimed the property of the UDF brand to have been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the UDF's office, controlled by friends of François Bayrou, who do not agree to remain, came out of silence to launch a stay for the minister and the MP, to stop using the seal and to pass on the brand's property to them, subject to judicial proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you were going to propose your political movement to +undertake+ the UDF seal, written the association in an e-mail signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your militant material and on your website's watch page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the today's slogan + UDF+, are also the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you do not have any right to use this seal, explains the UDF office that keeps the NC to remove "the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (la) mark to his legitimate right".
If you did not, the courts would be arrested to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF adherents, the signatories prevent.
In their e-mail, they state that the UDF "is a whole political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "choose" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training based by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, he continued the office, "when he deposited the brand", he was no longer "adherent to the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently exploiting the absence of the deposit of the UDF acronym to do so for its own account.
This indelicacy is becoming a crime, they declare, before ironing on the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worth making a name by itself than trying to get out of anonymity by taking a name that we are not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from a state of weakness of the octagonaire for the robbery of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a fine of a maximum of three years imprisonment and EUR 375,000 fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which the mother and daughter are still holding the queens of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expert from Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
L'Oréal's main heir and shareholder has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor during the investigation.
The designated physicians will have to report before 10 March 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt has been able to become weak and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to him, he said at the hearing, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is an excellent new one (...) The expert will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, has he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has engaged in prosecutions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and a touch-all artist, who accused her of having benefited for years from her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of gifts, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's tables.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned to the major family breakdown on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was embarrassed by Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the email dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to him since he was married."
On the other hand, Nanterre's prosecutor once again felt that the complainant was not acceptable to act, since more than a judge of all has refused to do so during the last few days at his request to open a judicial protection procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the representative of the public ministry.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management Revolution or End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises towards their employees, recalls the position of businesses towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees adhere to "values" determined above as was the case at the time, to impose on consumers the products thought of by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of winning the markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products of customer preference factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to mortifying demoralization.
Suicidals in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects the leaders.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the company's intellectual functions, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision" ; it requires employees to make a commitment that the administrative revenues are totally inconsistent.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns to the same degree as the client.
The usefulness of all related internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion polls – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after a lot of distractions, to do what she has always done.
- Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behavior.
From major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciens" and widely disseminated, on their own, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to "leviers" (sic) of the commitment of the leaders, a recent investigation of Ipsos appears in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, which is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution required for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is intended to adopt a final view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a means of achieving part of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motif functional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their business by using a predefined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create an area conducive to the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The "just war" is worth praising right in Obama
U.S. law welcomed the speech delivered on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "war just" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brokered the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, who was proud of the right wing of the Republican party, to the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that had just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, did she think?
Mr. Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On the other hand, I found this historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interrogated at the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a potential candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not return a price of peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former chronicle at Washington Post, Obama said "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting themselves as "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they are not doing much to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare to the right to not be convinced, an old Bush faucon, the former UN ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "tre, ampoule and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war is wrapped in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent people, has it been warned.
However, the press of the gauche centre remained commendable at the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that Nobel was provisionally assigned to Mr. Obama, qualified as "superproduction" even for a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily burned itself.
Mr. Obama "declared the speech he needed," said the New York Times, the judge "both dark and building".
Routes: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and the TLF, the sole patron organization to remain until the end of the day, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended in the word of strike and the threat of Christmas supplies.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoice" of this agreement, after several negotiations, began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTHER) had locked the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. so that everyone would agree and that at 6 p.m. the text would be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would have disturbed the end-of-year parties," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At hourly rates, for low wages, "we move from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big deal, but it's a long way from here, said Patricia Clos (FO).
Either we're going to order our militants that there are no locks, no locks in the food centers.
But we can always have some recalcitrants that are not happy, has he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even though it was "hard to grant increases on high wages in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) said "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revalidation of the travel costs of 3%, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million from the employer's fees" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending financial law for 2009, voted on Thursday night to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
The signing of the TLF enables the agreement to be applied in the first time to companies affiliated with the organization, and in the second time to the whole profession, in the case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
She will become "in the shortest possible time," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denouncing a "dupe market" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the food diners of the next Awakening, Unostra has regretted.
For the other, the agreement "is likely to increase the number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unsatisfied unions of RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RR A, the largest transport line in the city of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the management of the RATP left them on their hunger for their prize.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important Christmas shopping weekend, there will only be trains between 10:00 and 20:00, due to a train on two on the central track (between La Défense and Nation) and a train on four outside the central track.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Gallery, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve large stores".
The RR A across the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The short version of the RATP from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circled at peak hours, and almost no branch in cross-hours, as planned.
As a Thursday, there was no cohue on which the French were organized.
Thus in the morning, the St. Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of colleges and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "30 hours earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not know about saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a framework of agents and forces of the order.
The RRs operated by the SNCF from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or went from Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "maigres" by trade unions, of a meeting with the board Friday afternoon.
The Director of R & D proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for R & D A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its proposals for parentheses, angered the CGT, stressing that the management "was not able to solve a problem while it was done in road and SNCF".
A new meeting is scheduled to be held on Monday for "a wider examination of the conditions for the exercise of the profession", RATP said.
What also made the unions say that the company was "defeating users of the weekend".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded a headquarters establishment committee in Paris.
It was then that the management, who had refused any discussion until then during the strike, had suggested that the meeting be "in the interests of reconciliation".
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the submission of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Unions apply for a EUR 120 (Unsa) premium to EUR 150, including 30 variable euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the downgrading of working conditions on this line to the millions of daily travellers.
RR drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach from EUR 2,200 to EUR 2,700 gross and EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums, for off schedules, on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, heavy consequences decision
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court ruled that the main pro-Kurdish party of the country was dissolved, a decision that was immediately followed by manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to complicate the Government's task, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DPP) was dissolved as it had become a "house of activities harmful to the independence of the State and its indivisible unit", the President of the Hasim Killis Court declared to the press after four days of discussion.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-voice majority was required to pronounce the dissolution, Mr. Kilic said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and Member Aysel Tugluk, are political life-bans for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the rise in parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
Its leaders had before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalczynkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "Directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that he has no "organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify him as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court takes place when the Government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights to try to draw Kurdish support to the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said that a solution could lead to a surge in tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many protests against the conditions of PKK head Abdullah Öcalan's detention have degenerated in trials with the police in recent weeks.
As of the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast, mostly Kurdes.
The forces of the order pulled lacremogenic grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw molotov cocktails or stones, with cracks.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the Court's decision was going to "increas the despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurd, ndlr) by banning a party, it said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also deplores the decision.
We are, in principle, opposed to the closure of the parties.
That does not resolve anything, said Taner Yildiz Minister of Energy.
This decision is a total torpedoes of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, has he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very strict winter.
But the manager of the road derailment and sanding service (FES) is very clear that it is not for citizens to be harassed.
It's just so that the officers can test vehicle technology and learn to control them well.
And according to meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack snow and hail.
The ESF is following a very well-developed plan.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as he snowed on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures fell below zero, large sand vehicles traveled 20 main routes (known as A routes).
This includes the streets, the main arteries, such as the New Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes firefighting access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and pedestrian streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers start their service at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be washed with a road foundation that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
That's why the FES service starts at 3am in the morning "so that roads are cleared when daily migration starts."
There or it gets harder, that's when the snow falls at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the manager of the road derailment and sanding service "because no motorist is willing to let the salage vehicles pass".
Then, if it doesn't snow anymore, we take care of access roads and desert roads - such as Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and lateral roads are finally coming.
Mr Brauburger well knows that there are still some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES Pedestrian team is on its way to identify the areas considered dangerous and the passages.
With regard to cyclable tracks, FES services are generally unable to deal with this.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the bridges between 22 and 430 hours.
As the vergla forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salage vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It is also possible for the police to call for this special service.
The Dinosaurs Bay
The Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede would measure about 2 meters long for 1.50 m high, its later members were powerful, its long skull was equipped with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms would end up with facilitating grips and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, like the Sertling Nesbitt report from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made it part of the land that emerged from the supercontinent, Pangée and was on the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the light Tawa of a new day is the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us about the parenting, distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt did research with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the research team reported that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
The researchers have baptized him in the name of Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the dinosaur fossils from Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some incomplete bone fragments.
All paleontology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms certain theories about the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, when the saurines were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropodes (carnivores) which include later tyronosaur and velociraptor and which are the descendants of birds, sauropods, long-crowded quadrupeds, and those related to them and the herbivores of ornithichian species such as triretaops and stegosaure.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theorists.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found clues that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in its bones at the skull level, as well as birds that are the descendants of the theropodes.
These small air pockets facilitate bird breathing compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrates were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theorists with small air bags in its bones.
As the related line of the huge sauropods also had air bags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this innovation.
Three successive migration waves to North America.
As the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the sauriers had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution have been divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all of the emerging lands that formed the Pangée supercontinent.
This appears to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theorists that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advancing the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies says there would have been at least three migration waves to North America.
There have been some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silage, who lived in the current Poland and belong to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did the dinosaurs become the dominant tetrapods of the second century while they were experiencing a relatively rare sideline of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other saurines.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There could have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs had randomly survived while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then, dinosaurs were better adapted and could thus eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourable meteorite was the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and had been growing in the shade since then: it was mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from around the world.
There are professors from University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bréme.
The evacuation by the casino police at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the University Steering Committee.
Last week, the president of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by the students and teachers after the wall and works of art had been barboiled by graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
Signatories believe that the degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention on the part of the police team against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "inadmissible" to freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegate and criminalize the protest" and tries to make it forget the reasons for mobilization.
The University Steering Committee thus withdrew from discussions that would, however, be essential.
Course officers require that criminal prosecutions be suspended immediately.
The majority of the inhabitants did not participate in the degradation.
Licensing of protests
Young people from the Green Trade Union of the Service Sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity among students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the youth of the Verdi union.
With regard to the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, she said to the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden on Thursday during the TV show Current Hour.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Gauche (the Left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU holds the pretext of a few wall painted to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Gauche Party (Linke)
Instead of considering student arguments and claims, they are eliminated.
The La Gauche Party has tabled a motion which is the Minister of the Interior to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it was the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for searching for the secret weapon, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nano-electronic production and research sites have been established there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, a place of Frankfurt sciences – with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday of the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of Close Cooperation".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will enable FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering in Moscow, the great Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Elektronika firm.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armament research.
Zelenograd (literary translation "City Green") draws its name from the wooded hills of which the research centres are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed sufficiently high.
For its participants, this is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe".
S21, it is much more than the intrusion of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will sink the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, into a desperate chaos of engineering for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the 1980s.
The railway stations, with roads that ended up in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the remnants of the 19th century transport technology that made a break from modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrived, stopped short, left – that's what needs to be done.
That's why the line-up stations have to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train pass station, which is about halfway across the Trans-European Railway Mastership between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "the heart of Europe" is.
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost, to reach the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
In fact, the front-line cars no longer really have entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with autoreals and car-pilot at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and community policies have led them.
The railway company is part of the company because it is the taxpayer who makes the risks of the largest project of infrastructure of the federal republic rather than the public enterprise.
From a urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a urban space that – if you believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to whom it was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - huge growth.
At that time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new track, with its inclination, does not fit the trains of goods.
The S21, and this is much more serious about many other railway projects indirectly.
For example, six billion euros will be added to the Souba project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, this money will be missing for other points of connection and anchoring in the network.
The Department of Transport lists sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to back down here on the champion.
But the S21 project has the effect of braking.
The Rhine Valley's route is about to become the cradle of international goods trafficking, which is at the heart of Europe.
Government examines the judgment of the airport
In the regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the country raised the possibility of appealing to the judgement of the Hesse Administrative Court on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review from a legal point of view the judgement rendered by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the country should adjust the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case of the construction of the northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The permit to land for 17 aircraft between 23 a.m. and 5 a.m., as planned by the Government of the Country, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night-time air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to file an appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this time and tries to pressure the Government's representative to bring him before the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted of banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be regarded as a total failure to a given word.
It is sacredly difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the Chief of the Tarek Al-Wazir Greens, alluding to the electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the government of the country is trying to authorize overnight flights using "advocacy and rubling".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements by its party on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
U.S. banks repay the aid granted
The large American banks, very affected by the crisis, are disconnected from their relations towards the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid $45 billion (more than €30 billion) in the Treasury, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The American TV chain CNBC reported on a report that Citigroup also planned to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions are thus seeking to eliminate the restrictions imposed, which were accompanied by the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of the bonuses awarded to managers and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital by selling securities to investors who reported $19 billion in cash.
The rest of the amount comes from bank cash that is well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday last night, Kenneth Lewis, Director General of the Bank of America, had to express his gratitude to US taxpayers: the injection of capital has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by purchasing Merrill Lynch's investment bank to the strongest of the financial storm.
The Citigroup also plans to make money available on financial markets in order to free itself from State protection.
The U.S. bank could thus launch an increase of $20 billion from Thursday, reporting the CNBC chain citing banking environments.
Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
Finally, everything happened even faster than expected.
Only two weeks after the removal of the current editorial position by the ZDF chain administration board, Nikolaus Brender, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin edition of ZDF, was a great favor.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there has also been a willingness not to harm the ZDF member Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend the Nikolaus Brender contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had voted in favour of the resumption of Brender and 7 had voted against.
In fact, the CDU, which is a majority member of the Board of Directors, had already heard several weeks before the vote, did not wish to reinstate Brender to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly estimated editor-in-chief by calling for the reduction of the ZDF's information emissions under Brender.
That is why the protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, fusing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had implicated in the debate and thought that the way in which Koch acted was anti-constitutional.
But it wouldn't have worked at all.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied science-policy, teaching and Roman languages (Spanish).
He then worked in the Southwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German national scale).
In 1983 he became the editor of the ZDF first of all in the magazine of "present-day journal" (present-day journal).
Then he continued his journey: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then he was in Washington in 1991/92, then and until 1998 he was the head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (bimonthly information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Berlinese editorial.
After Brender's dissatisfaction, while he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch to the Board of Directors, the Prime Minister of Rhenanie-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the intruder's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a party political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political personalities of the ZDF Monitoring Committees.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of Brender, had skillfully handled the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehemence in his decision to clear Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalism independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the Board of Directors could elect it without suspecting a political party.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is left liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
A partial success for students: after an educational year of strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of Länder decided to show themselves more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Directors, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to ease the weight of the examinations: a single review must allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions want to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder are also committed to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master branches.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulation from one country to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the heads of universities have repeatedly spoken the word "tudiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be completed by a single examination", can be read in a 30-page document on the future admission conditions for academic cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the removals, which would significantly affect the feasibility of the study.
"Studyability" should in future be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and scope of manoeuvre necessary to enable and promote the personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reccredited" every 5 years, however, which means that in 2015 all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that rely on accreditation councils established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on the Länder to weigh the agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhine-Palatinate is still the only country to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities are required to organize programmes to strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and international relations service.
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one examination will have to be carried out to complete its studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible, and the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions must be ensured and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition discussed the subject of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticisms were made.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students indicated that he would like the organization of education policy no longer to "after the closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
Not later than after the educational strike, students as individuals should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Directors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us" she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Lands with whom HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) decisions in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each graduated Bachelor to join a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder provide students with Bachelor today, that there will be enough room tomorrow for studies in Master and study conditions as good as possible.
The Länder therefore have to hire more trainees.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one bottom note on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the experiences of a dissident who has gained freedom but lost his linguistic territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was the first German and English professor in Bucharest and then the director of the collection in a youth edition house before he moved to Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the very coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm Art House in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a convention in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror deforming your security files".
Apparently destabilized and gentified, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Security Policy.
Söllner received the German language award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The enrolment tests began in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes "so someone who has not been able to withstand the intimidation of Security".
The poet Werner Söllner is informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary remains with the mechanisms of the dictatorship's power, the literary scene is broken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abisms and weakness of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own security file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his behalf.
"He was able to remove it from all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, but the presence of an old dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not in fact so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and sometimes become what real names were last hidden by Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Instead of Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process in the meantime, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security files is still very confused.
Systematic lighting has been constantly counter- and slowed down in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council belonging to the Birthler institution was created to work on the Assimilation of the Archives of Security (NSAS) but the return of the files has been drawn.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining archive management.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of an old head of the Security of Temesvar who, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in three ways with respect to the award.
She had a psychosis, and at the end of the day, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many ineligible issues are associated with the Söllner case as this often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been segregated? The heavy reaction of the auditors, on Söllner's behalf, lets hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the origin of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote at the bottom.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was the impression that a representative arrived there, pulled four beads coming right out of a nice Christmas party, on which the sports article manufacturer had lined up his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross rides less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose skull would attract attention, was allowed to drive into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our 50-year-old would have been able to take the steering wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was not happy anymore.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that had just been engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth end," that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni from Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success.
The "great work" awaits us Sunday.
There, it's about repeating the results of the league of champions on a daily basis in Mainz.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have surfaced after the three expeditions of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lottery
The eighth final of the Champions League (matcher gor 16/17. + 23/24 February/match return 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released on 18 December in Nyon.
Thus, the joy of becoming the dominant successor of Babel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderated with the one who had brought the chance, who had sent to the dissatisfied Stuttgart professionals, a reason without fault and the pleasure of playing.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "sweep of souls" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well that no longer had any effect on the care of Babbel.
He started a certain magic, said Jens Lehmann - Babbel's partisan - "in the foot when there is a new impulse there are sometimes things that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, progressed to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the " phenomenon" found by a Provial "fresh wind" and the new leader's method of work: "It's someone who passes into action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the cap, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, players and managers are well prepared to reassess the victory against a totally over-defenced and weakened Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow four days later a bad wake at Leverkusen with 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the objectives of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven't passed the hardhead yet.
That Heldt's 40th anniversary didn't have the heart to celebrate, even after his first home victory for three months, it's from weekend events that a television interview of the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made about it just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would oppose Heldt, in response to Lehmann's aberrant criticism.
He accused the management of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under the pressure of pubertyal fans.
Lehmann also considered it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day of freedom after the matches had been removed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by a pure selfishness” and Heldt announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risk becoming friends for these two quadrennials.
In any case, they agreed for everything else, i.e. that without the group's prior work by the replaced coach, strong sports and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a great deal of success" and returned Heldt and Lehmann in heart – and even the man in the plastic bag acquired.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warming hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and systematically.
But after 12 difficult rounds, Ukraine defends its title as the heavyweight champion of the world according to the WBC Federation version.
With the unanimity of the judges, it was necessary.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko preserves its title as the heavyweight champion of the world.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night, the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the points at the unanimousity of the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko is honoring his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
In the past, Ukraine had won twice the world championship of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the KO so expected.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional battles, has to admit twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat at the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mostly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, on his left.
Johnson, from 11 centimeters smaller than the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's beatings, thus preventing Klitschko from playing against the dangerous right.
Johnson, too passive for a challenger, has mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having crossed the distance of the 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko as a "zombie villain" who "is not really capable".
During the weight Friday, the champion couldn't stop himself from provoking Johnson by making him drop his sunglasses from his nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko re-employed during his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had fought at the time Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "sa" WBC belt that he had previously left without fighting.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Areola of the United States.
"I just took a shot in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Vladimir is a WBO and IBF Federation champion.
But it is British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Waljew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional company is planning to make this game play now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence of lying in the Kunduz case.
The parties SPD and La Gauche (the Left) ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After considering the latest information on the Kunduz Air Attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deciding to dissemble certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a contradiction" on the murder of two tank trucks last September, said the leader of the Greens parliamentary group Jürgen Trittin on Saturday during the issuance of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is essentially the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the objective of the strike was actually not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured during the US air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Gauche prayed on Saturday to Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak as soon as possible in front of the federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Verts Renate Künast party are of the opinion that Madame Angela Merkel must clearly state whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government's policy if the chancellor, army and information services approved this new strategy.
The Government ' s spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellorship has no influence on military intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, votes were increasing to express doubts about the real reasons for the referral of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Department.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had sent to Guttenberg on the attack of tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have deduced the existence of the NATO report and hid some humiliating details from the Minister.
However, in the area of the two senior officials, it is clear that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeier Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have asked for clarification of the facts in an e-mail.
Until now, he hasn't got an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which was due to be held on Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
There is nothing but mental illness, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is very well.
When we lie down in our dreamy rooms, we can see without hindrance the most crazy dreams and ghosts.
However, one who wakes up with the experience of dreaming, hearing and seeing things that others don't perceive, has rushed the reputation in our Western world to be crazy or drugged, or to be at least an original.
Such images and voices appear only in mental patients or under the influence of drugs.
It's our imagination that's in question: it's the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes encourages the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of consciousness, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, to the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are different, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the Prophet of New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the chamois, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances in the brain - firstly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achethylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always wondered about the relationship between madness and dreams.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that made it".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon band.
Its body is in two dimensions in the creamy colors.
The earthly attraction has no more power over him, he plans on the edge of the ceiling.
It feels like a blow.
Behind him are the creatures of the devil winged, grinning, the bleeding mouth, showing the teeth.
They're after him, they're giving him legs with heavy flamboyant boots, they're throwing him against the walls, he feels pain in the whole body.
Toniturous voices, evil voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear these voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, actually a loop and connects it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He rides on a buffalo and passes the loop around the neck.
He misses it.
The loop is decomposing.
What a lesson this is for you, they scream in a chorus to pull his tampane. "Go to a clinic and take care!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old. He has lived six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first soon 20 years.
It was launched by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness and has been married for three years.
During the time of psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
A percent of the population suffers at least once in their lives from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most frequent disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the individuals concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitement, which may cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomony, sexual madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare anymore.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is clouded under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the doors to a array of ideas and ghosts from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of the reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the CHU of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinium).
The schizophrenia is at the centre of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Make the experience once in his life of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is essentially preserved".
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of life takes place in a real framework.
Why does our brain make this kind of cockroaches, it's always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals concerned have minor brain damage.
The brain's neuronal maturation is supposed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains remains unexplained is the way the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, however there is a predisposition.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms.
What is crazy is that psychologist Erich Kasten from Lübeck tells us that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
For ten years Kasten has collected reports on hallucinations and illustrative image phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or Cranial trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when the brain areas that deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not cool enough; when our brain is warm but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental conditions.
In recent studies, at least one third of the participants recognize that they have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania before and going to high school.
A young girl has to do everything she can to make it normal to say the truth.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, it is possible that a young boy, thin, long-haired, speaks to him.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a lunatic dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's certain.
She wakes up, hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young sympathetic.
I'm crazy, if she asks you sometimes.
But she well knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the appearances are generally frowning.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she can't follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while it's invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations in the table.
At night the appearances are generally frowning.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that arrives too rarely and too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the grizzling faces or the young girl with bloody heels on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she yells at these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a fool.
In the fall of 2009, Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bag last year and she lived with her friend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since she came online with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is that he has hallucinations at the end of a certain time.
I suppose the brain isn't busy enough, so there's an animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "a place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately we have a quick tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and medical chief of the psychiatric and psychiatric clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroide, a particular form of change in the consciousness of dreams.
Oniroides vecus are very complex semi-reves that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot distinguish from the dream even when it is awake.
The condition of oneiroid consciousness is manifested during trauma or in extreme pathologies, as in patients with fully conscious polyradiculopathy, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is separated from reality.
It is a state of mind-limiting between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
This is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that has been given to us men, not to be overshadowed by the lack of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his unique experiences in his book "The Changing of Hearts" as an action for the preservation of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscience travels for several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time his body is sentenced to remain in reanimation.
Claussen dives into a world he created from all parts, visits foreign places, travel in time. He is seen as an old man ally in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his head watching for his health.
He lives in the middle of the age among the nobles who make blood-based drugs.
He is taken away by a Greek motorbike who takes him to his country, surfes with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mob.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these internal journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, writing describing what he has lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than real life.
The intensity of this life exacerbates the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oniroides, psychoses, hallucinations and psychic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take the lead in the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment to Burda's PDG post is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he said in Spiegel's newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, editor Hubert Burda sees his company between the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All the details have been fixed in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable.
It is impossible to impose its children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to deal with it.
This would demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he withdrew from the post of President-Director-General as of January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
He then took care of the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after leaving Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it's not a family member who's in the head of Burda's editions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old respectively, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% between the hands of the family.
Ruins have always taken place in families that have been led by a capital bulimia, which have made enormous speculations by thinking that they could get even higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, said Burda.
I do not see myself in the country's preceptive role as Springer, and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, is within reach.
This is the objective of El Corte Englishés, which has just been inaugurated in Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, boasts prestigious teachings such as Hedonai, laser spying specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, coffers, Marina d'Or, which has a sports room, or L'Occitine and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a dining area, with in particular a tea room, which offers over 130 different varieties.
Spassion offers you among other things to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while considering the exceptional views on the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a cup of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 distributed into 12 rooms, where care can be taken of the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The sports room also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide customers' steps, offering them fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly carry out our exercise program.
His director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to make all the muscles in the body work.
And if after doing our work, we want to go through the coffee parlor, the Luis & Taci teacher has a room where you can offer hair repair, luminosity or nutrition rituals, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Miscellaneous
Christmas approaches and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party dress.
The form of decolletation, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decolonation. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, equipped with electric car
The endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Ayuntamento de Barcelona, has created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will establish mobility agreements, taking action, coordinating, providing grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities ”
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Séville come to join the project.
It is the three cities selected by the government, within the framework of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The Endesa electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generality of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has an additional set of projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT GREENDE.
Zapatero is interviewing "a future of calm" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed "a future of calm" for the Spanish automotive industry, which he recalled is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Car Sector Competitiveness Plan, today we would have an abandoned landscape, closing some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Full Plan for the Automobile Sector (IPA), devoted EUR 800 million to 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief of Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government support measures on demand, in line with Plan 2000E, in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and has contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which have progressed by 40 per cent in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Car Collection Hall, a meeting space for the professionals and passionates of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pabellón de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorbikes and car collections, but we can also find in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
For example, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, reviews, thumbnails, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Cupe-Francisco Pouche, car sales and restaurant, or Cochera Classicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this hall will also include parallel activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also take place on a circuit built outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, baptized i-Stop, a device that is at least available on engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note it has obtained as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it appears that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touch of the steering wheel is particularly pleasant to him.
By continuing with the set formed by the control table and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as live colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That's why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Gulf of Volkswagen, which all want to overcome.
By continuing with the apartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
This adds a large box to regular forms.
The engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the engine with two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of six speeds.
This motor is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with fuel engine, both for its great comfort of speed and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is Sportive, in other words the one that presents the largest number of serial elements.
Among the serial equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed controller, photosensitive internal mirror, large-screen on-board computer, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which, for an additional EUR 1,500, includes among other elements of the bi-xenon adaptive headlamps and an audio BOSE system with a disk charger.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do much of kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the engine with 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for the Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, Sportive.
In contrast to this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embedded by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever bloated us, dressed in as elegant models as sexy for Nina's exit. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had chosen for a dark "lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch its email, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attached parts or browsing the Internet.
It benefited from its five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated it as one of the year's products.
In fact, it is more difficult to see him in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, i.e. less than half of what it costs, for example, the date subscription of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free living data service, for six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's as limited as his American grandfather, but it's a surprise.
The monthly subscription price, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a phone connection) to be able to consult its mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and this has been going on for a long time.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a physical thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a very tangible effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariff, meaning that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals to enable them to make their data network cost-effective.
Kindle is another good example, including downloading books and other Internet research.
No subscription and no gallery.
It's a connected device and it's paid when you buy it, not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: an option with access to life like Peek already offers it to the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on my phone, thanks.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is undoubtedly the preferred color of the first woman in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's office to the U.S. presidency with a dress and a coat of that color, she chose the same to accompany him at the second, no doubt the most important moment in her life: she returned it to Oslo at the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama carried a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow drawing green with brilliant reflections, twice the dress consisted of three pieces: the dress, dress and coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
As for the first time, it would seem that the first lady in the United States followed the silhouette of the Asturias Princess and chose to return the same hostages.
But the tissue in which both sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth, instead, it would bring a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-sized green shoes for the first time, and a similar, but golden model this time.
She also changed her hair: the hair is now picked up while she was wearing them the previous time.
75 per cent of working mothers had professional problems due to their maternity
Employment discrimination has increased in recent years, especially for young women who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Fecondity and professional career of women in Spain" carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey, conducted by 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their limited professional career due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the start of life in marriage and the number of children, whether or not the woman is working and the type of employment employed.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married early, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women who have stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are retiring from marriage and first marriage, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age have their first child, on average, 3.7 years of age after they have been married. This figure goes to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to reject the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised has a wide influence on maternity, but less on the date of the beginning of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap between the age of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who conducted elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have conducted elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done middle or higher education invest in this program and give priority to getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Mrs. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several brand products, immersing the universal currency "Because I want it well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors in the international scene, thus joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the brand of cosmetics also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangelical companion in Lost).
The prices of British mode
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its largest representatives, creators and mannequins, both yesterday and today, met for the annual redistribution of their prices, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elect the Best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's ace poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty "radiographies" of writers who have spent his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to predictable and understood genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent doesn't save the bad guys or the lights.
This book is also an exciting invitation to reading and reading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, the same that I felt without name: pleasure against the fate of the Funest, moral without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotent and ignorance, with a poetic humour that blushed, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that killed him.”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion lasting for thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven through the path of destruction."
On James Joyce: "The Ulyssa was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be recorded by the northern front, on which the best climbers are still and still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange guy.
For himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did it in the flight of himself and by calling the posteriority with a violent speech to the asticates."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she fell to her knees and prayed, "God-loving God, I beg you to make me stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were burned the faces of Spencer: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life, tired of death ravit."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depression.
Her husband agreed very normally that she told her that Edward VII was spying on her among the azales or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and loving as a neuroscientist whose literary talent surpassed madness."
On Pío Baroja: « What did Martín-Santos do if there is no attempt to dissipate Joyce at Baroja?
What do you want Benet to do if he doesn't shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did He do if it is not to suck this man's glory to serve him as a pedestal?"
A Lace of Aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, walked into our neighborhood of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood-meal, saved from the SPA and weighed no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they sat down on her two legs that left the dog badly injured.
Our anger is huge because we don't see what's fun to attack a little animal without defense free of charge, which was also left behind.
In addition to this, the indignation of a woman who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, became afraid of her physical integrity, because an energizer who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person less than him.
The episode took place about 5 p.m. one Tuesday as another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the district commissioner's office, even if we believe that this is a matter of great importance and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the killer lashes were Spanish.
Anger has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on in young people to find fun to abuse for free a defenseless animal that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has been.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the port of helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of helmet, mainly among the younger motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet's port, since it is the only protection element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin indicated that this campaign included its commitment to road safety, which "is beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributed to this goal by other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to encourage the port of helmet in two wheels, under the currency "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers' employers' union.
However, the good news should be announced, since the comparison reference, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rewinding of the previous month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles (tourist cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light-duty trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect most of their demand are not so dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100 per cent of the cases by means of external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions imposed by the limitation of bank appropriations, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation should be added.
In view of this situation and the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for the purchase of 2000E was limited.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs wishing to purchase a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre may also benefit from it, but the number of operations itself speaks of itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, we again recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The Association of Dealers provides for a year similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As this has been done with the ABS brake blocking system and as this will be done with the ESP stability control, emergency braking support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union is aimed at strengthening pedestrian protection, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system by means of the driver's kick.
But the latter doesn't always keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for Bosch cars, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not support the brake before collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of item, up to 1 100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that a disaster on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors toss the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant Figueruelas (Saragose) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he would need more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, believes that each item of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
This may include the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, being postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has put pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as quickly as possible.
GM admits to be in touch with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch manufacturer of Skype sports cars, supported by the Russian Converg group, is of importance.
If there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Baic Chinese company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder fly
To design their latest and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers left Boxster S and managed to start at nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move, first of all, from the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air-conditioning, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of gain, to mount sports tanks, another 12 kilos, and with light 19 inches, 5 kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning six additional kilograms and replacing the handles with tissue handles, saving the rest of the kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double-braked PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly twisted turns.
His conduct can only be described as reprehensible.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with an aperture.
On the contrary, it has been a long time since we did not test a model so small and light that at the same time guarantees so much safety in the gears, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to heat up his muscle little speed during the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and recharge his engine...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to his direction, as communicative as he says, the car will do what our hands will tell about the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Voluntary engine sound
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 plus the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the engine noise, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at the end or at the time of recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The cover of the roads that we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty thin, but the car managed well the nests of the chicken.
Electronic assistants hardly make an act of presence on the whole journey, while on some turns we found from the verglas in the morning and the gravy later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light car, more fun driving and much more than a simple modification of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of EUR 70,831.

Basconia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a triumph at 91-82 on its visit to the hard terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus in the head of its group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight posters to three points, was the best of its team (29 evaluations).
Vitoria's team was able to complete Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov's significant absences with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 banners at three points marked, will largely determine the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blues and reds, which took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four banners of the Vitoria team have been marked since the perimeter, meant that they had jumped on the Israeli field with hot fists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20th end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the Alava team chose the internal game of Barak and Elijahhu's work, which was received by acclamation and applause back to his former home, to increase their benefit at break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to notice himself as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although the "less than six" of Splitter's assessment had already made it predict that this night was not going to be Brazil's best.
But in this game, despite being on the right track to rest, nothing was played, far away, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that we didn't get so easily on their land, and thanks to "the hand of Elijah", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the benefit of the yellow on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from being dead, needed to find some practical action to take the air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged that, with three posters at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, sent the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises were able to accentuate at the end of the third quarter time (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play everything at all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) said they were not going to let anyone take what they had earned for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for errors, Ivanovic's players didn't rush, defend themselves well, and although the Israelis approached during the last minute (80-85), the part was already played and the victory escaped to Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Wounds prevent Unicaja from delivering a battle
Unicaja lost a lot in Greece in front of the Olympiacos and handed over the head of the Euroligue Group B, during a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been derailed by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship flag or by the vastness of the rival, no doubt one of Europe's most powerful and budgeted.
The game of the first quarter time, led to the dream of the Andalusians. An aggressive defense and three banners at three consecutive points, two from the Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who blew up the local team 12-18 at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20 at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of bazaar, between the American minors Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury from the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
Internal players and Lithuanian oil tanker Linas Kleizas, with their three-point carts, increased the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
A Resurrectable Resurrect
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, was shown to be higher and even managed to equalize the difference between the meeting in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the group's head to be destroyed.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point basket, and Lewis' support, left little hope with 66-57 at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was virtually impossible because Olympiacos proved to be unmistakable when the players put pressure on and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, succeeded in raising the score to 81-62 at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submits, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you pay according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the pay they would earn on the basis of their profile, thanks to a new application by Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates user salaries from over 140,000 job offers available in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since one week of application, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker "has been badly paid", explained in a communiqué the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovita from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the least well-paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 gross euros annually and a French, 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver sees 34 247 gross euros annually in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of the server, with 11,592 annual net euros, followed by the seller, with 14,725 euros, and the worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of the driver, of the mid-term and of the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his Embassy of Tegucigalpa.
The vice-president will be required to leave the diplomatic league no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed on TV Globo that "Mel" knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been refugees since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, following his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile which was intended to impose on him the government actually presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After days of roses since the last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise markets was to raise debt by direct acquisition of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at close zero rates so that financial institutions would buy assets to mobilise.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without questioning their non-conformity liquidity policy, they are beginning to put some sand into the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their award to one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reverse of the reduction of risk premiums.
Vulnerability of bonds and differences in corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt.
Once again, there is a return to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the chosen investors' shelters, leading to an increase in differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a new revision at the fall in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad enough to discourage moral risk defenders, who have tried again to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy who have hampered the destructive effects of the limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decree a new day of action of grace.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between emirs to restore its place to power in emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissipates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot to the roses.
Produce it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly unreasonable for Ecofin to save Hungary from a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area Member State to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of the normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excessive positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our differences in public debt are increasing in the measure of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decrease and our growth continued, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncrasic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdotes. When our predictive indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to review their forecast upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back on track with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not open much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment "prudential is a mother of safety".
Connected Sectors
The President of Iberdola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday in front of the Congress of Members' Subcommission, where Spain's energy strategy is being discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sought for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommission at eight o'clock.
For the President of Iberdola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million by 2020 and EUR 60,000 more between that date and 2030, if nuclear power plants are to remain open today.
If not, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting from 2020, the issue changes, and power will have to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this regard, it considers that 18,000 MW is more necessary, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what its company demands, did not wish to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "points" measures, as the President of Iberdrola described them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, as they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Air Lingus maintenance market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground-based airport services, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance provides for an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Actiona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Actiona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site is an estimated $1,700 million Australian tunnel (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is such an option to allow Actiona to establish itself in the country as a public and car dealer.
The mayor of the city wants to be able to make it available by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project successfully, within the framework of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the payroll.
In view of the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment is $1,700 million in Australia (about €1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The baptized Transcity group is led by Actiona, the only Spanish company in smoothness, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground specialists.
Against the Actiona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Construction Group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtif, which has its turn of participation in the ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Galois company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major constructions and privatisations, but entering it is a great challenge, if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvaluable step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
The ACP has just won a position on this market by its 30% stake in Hochtif, the owner of Leighton.
Monetary assets
It has taken action on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the de-balancing sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the grouping of business to raise and manage Adelaide's delicacies, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the infrastructure development and management markets.
The underground road, promoted by the Infrastructure Office of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (north link), is called to link Toowong's western motorway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce traffic coverage in Brisbane.
The administrative schedule indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this route will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two routes, an electronic weighing system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute $500 million (€308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtif
Australia continues to make extensive fruitful Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company held by ACS will, through its local branch of Leighton, equip the infrastructure of the high-voltage national network in optical fibre.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have rapid Internet access and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given up the King George Tower construction project on 27 floors in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtiv has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having seen the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria for a total of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the building is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore saw Renfe's advertising award
Renfe has provided advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros a year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies that have presented themselves to the call for tender organized by Renfe, of which four have been finalists, including TBWA which has been responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million in France Telecom to stop competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million in France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and programs of reliability to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state firm have accumulated more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it has placed on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reciprocated.
A store of applications
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary has followed the silage of other operators and opened a web application store with the aim of increasing revenues that are not derived from voice transmission.
At the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which puts them in the third and fifth positions of the clubs that have invested the most money in this competition.
The United Manchester is at the top of the list.
The United Manchester is at the top of the list.
Gaining the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of income from major clubs.
In fact, the competition has allocated EUR 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The White Club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophies three times.
The Catalan club, currently under the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
The Manchester United and the Munich Bayern are on the list, the two teams who have also made the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it has won more than any other title (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by the UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini's agency plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the ranking games (including the Madrid Atletique) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate have received 3.8 million only to be there, in addition to EUR 550 00 for each match they competed for.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (EUR 800,000) and equality (EUR 400,000 for each team). Those who arrive at the eighth end will receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive at the fourth end will receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive 4 million each.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça has taken 2.5 million to win the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337,8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four places.
The previous year's champion ranks 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
New Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the sale of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to launch a public procurement offer (OPA) for the whole of the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per action, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this report.
Yesterday Sos's shares ended at EUR 1.85 ; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the EUR 1.50 price reflects Sos's actual assessment.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
CNMV made sure that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos had claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If necessary, the decommissioning would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of his direction.
In an attempt to stay out of any bids to buy and go and come judges from his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes the first woman occupy a position in the food business.
This is a newly created post that will depend directly on the president of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility that over the next few months Sos reveals new distortions of funds cannot be avoided.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared yesterday before the National Court that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet presented "adequate" as a result of the amendments applied on 2 December.
CNMV stated that the offer concerned the acquisition of 550 008 shares by Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the social capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares had been immobilized and could not be transferred in any way before the end of the offer, which he indicated was that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad times and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate by hand the cost of repair between €20,000 and €30 000, including parts and the work hand can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then treating them and offering them to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Group Solara, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and information processing are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so much so that more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car leaves the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be cataloged and recorded.
In addition, there is a "smart" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a car.
If this is a mass-sold model, work can be done within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If this is a small car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information about the Porsche, but not about the Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99 %.
In order to carry out the documentation and development of databases, Audex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in some brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent application concerns repair and maintenance, but according to countries, there are also tools for the management of parts of the case or to calculate the value of a car's vein or residual value.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of opportunity cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint barge.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5.75 for low-use customers at least ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it comes out of the mounting chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass of the vehicles, and AudaSubbastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that enables you to fill on broken declared vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, carry out geo-demographic analyses or know the current problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand have gone to the garage for a panel or how many have suffered severe disasters for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing such tools.
It commercialises, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for disaster assessment, recovery or maintenance.
The GT evaluation guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% per year over the last three years, and it has made a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she has undertaken her internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
On his side, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is achieved in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global business figure of the Solera Group (Audtex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed in the $1 000 million stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been next to the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Car Accidents on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the capital of the company, which could be extended to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is addressed exclusively to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional vendors who need to be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of chassis has been removed can no longer circulate, but, on the other hand, some parts that are not silencing can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-stage garage
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a device in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search the spare room, create a device and generate it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 of tourism, 109 all-terrestrials, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer and Internet connection to use it.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the required piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as the labour price, increases or reductions, then he can print the device to return it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros a year, which can be credited.
Currently, the Audex company works to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and make it turn to see the inner face.
