Republican strategy to resist the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republic have justified their policy on the need to combat counterfeiting in the elections.
At the Brennan Centre, however, they consider the latest myth, claiming that the cases of counterfeiting in the United States elections are less rare than those of death than those of stroke.
In addition, Republican lawyers had only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voters.
In this sense, such actions are partially discredited by the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most States Governments have since 2009 adopted laws that make registration or voting more difficult.
This event was new since the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, only 180 bills were adopted for one year 2011 limiting voting rights in 41 states.
New electoral laws require the elector to provide a photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, nullify the right to register the elector on the day of election and withdraw the right to vote among citizens with jurisdiction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had committed voters to submit identity certificates with the photograph.
India became the first state to make such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities have been speeding up the spread of this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated legislation that obliges voters to submit identity certificates with the photograph in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card like a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have the identity of the photograph issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a document in 2012.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity certificate is often more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000, 18 per cent of those who are 65 years old and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the required identity card with the photograph.
But that's not all.
Students are not allowed to use the identity of the photograph issued by their educational institution in several states, which is considered to vote for the candidates from the Democrats.
The same states therefore allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mainly for the Republicans to use the certificate issued by those clubs to vote.
By 2004, no state had required evidence of American citizenship for voting.
The first such requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
It is believed that two thirds of the Latin American voters voted in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators introduced in 2011 laws that abolished the voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This limitation was not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the electoral registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent decline in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of voters who voted early were African-Americans, although only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state were the last.
The same has happened with Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of the voters were 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, which formed 76 per cent of voters, only 46 per cent of the voters voted early.
Of course, the legislators and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were promised by democratic governors.
The most divergent laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney-General.
This has partially limited the negative impact.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of identity certificates with the photograph.
However, the new rules that have entered into force will, of course, make it difficult to exercise the electoral right in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the predominance of the laws that have been adopted, with a clear focus on affecting the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Centre shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to argue with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voters.
In this sense, such actions are partially discredited by the system of American democracy.
Screening the cancer of the presence of the iron: running a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives incorrect results, false, and sometimes false positives that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly dissociating themselves, have even more doubts.
Is the test going on or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have seen a number of cases of infection among study groups, so the data received are difficult to interpret and make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a different level of mortality among patients who had gone through screening and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that metastases were 30-40 per cent higher than those who had not been screened.
I would therefore recommend that the test be carried out from 50 years old, or 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and violent.
The patient needs to clarify the risk of his or her cancer by offering options without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a long-term risk to life, and by choosing, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
To this day, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
More and more, we accurately define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
I would therefore recommend that the test be carried out anyway.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not the test is to be carried out.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Mowember has established an instrument to assess all for and against the passage of the PSA test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, respect for a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one smoked anymore, this figure would have increased to at least 50 per cent," stressed Andre Bole, the Canadian Association of Cancer Press Secretary.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cases of cancer are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Association of Cancer, smoking remains a priority despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is related to 85% of cases of mild cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to people’s health.
"Even today in Quebec there are 1.5 million smokers," says Andre Bole, the press secretary.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Wes
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct cirrhosis, food water, iron and mattresses.
“Research shows that regular physical activity protects against cancer of the backbone throughout life”, adds the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of cancer of the stomach.
Coves should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by pressing, drying or dressing may lead to the formation of cancerous substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at this point, the results of these studies are not unique.
In the opinion of the SCC, vitamin E studies produce contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave an opposite result.
The impact on the development of vitamin D cancer is also unclear.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with a doctor.
"An analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to find Higgs' boson, caused this excruciation - and not without reason.
It is thought that this bozon explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last particle that was predicted under the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the "minimum imperfect" description of nature and the behavior of matter - that was previously not able to find an experienced way.
But physics isn't sure until the end that this is Higgs Bay.
We know, without a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it reminds us very much of the Higgs Boson, which is predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet available for full certainty.
Let's imagine, however, what this is about Higgs Bay, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, a law that is totally inevitable that two things cannot happen in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to round that rule, even try not to be too hard, or hurt yourself.
But while the physics of basic particles is quite strange, it also appears that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of the exception of Paul, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum” state, it is the “state” that is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find well-being citizens called farmers who wisely submit to the Paula principle.
On the other hand, the bozones, the disgusting band of anarchists, who have no respect for anything, at least to this principle, mean that they can be quiet in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (as it is completely unusual) Particle Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bozones are divided into two groups: the mezones we don't talk about here and the “parts of the force” through which the main forces of nature are distributed and which in some ways belong to the Higgs bozone.
These very bozones should be emphasized, not all of them as exotic as they could possibly be thought of.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal bozone: photon, or "parts of light", which is the "curier" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "infringes" an electromagnetic field in this particular place, such as a rock thrown into the mud.
This “infringement” produces an electromagnetic wave (the world, or infrared discharge, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon -- and therefore one of the bozones of “power carriers”.
More stable field
The same is true of Higgs's boson, with only the difference that for that boson to appear, the other field, the Higgs' field, must be "demonstrated."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable in the electromagnetic field; in order to stimulate it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen stream, whose surface could only be broken down by a very large stone.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operating in CERNA, the Great Adrone Collider, which is a 27 km-diameter ring!, to achieve such enormous energy.
The same with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact; others do not. For example, the paper sheet will never be held on the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as photon, by the way) do not.
So, what can you bring in all this research, Mrs. Plamondon?
They are used in science to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (PM), which also enables physicists to discern the difference between the results of observations and the forecasts of the MM.
In addition, some of them yearn for such a distinction to be found, that is, the slightest inconsistencies can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the doors of the Model.
The last one is that there are still significant shortcomings, without any explanation for gravity (uh!) or dark matter, which constitutes about 80% of the universe (uh!).
But until such differences were found in CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average human being are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that they are not.
Note: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bella's laboratories could not even imagine what revolution their work would bring.
They predicted their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell's Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960 and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously impulsed) in 1962, said that the original laser was considered rather a "laboratory boyfriend".
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be used for the accompanying study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his 1969 optical research.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as an “eye” for all the world’s digital cameras and earned the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Greater Adron Collaire will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative assistance is the best way to die...
The Commission recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life in Quebec for worthy of death.
The debate must be resumed soon and the bill is being drawn up.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this important area.
"Long" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Monterey.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been giving five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, is lying in bed in the shelter of Victor Gadbwa's palliative care in Belarus, where he first arrived.
"But it's always a shock, it can't be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow itself to walk into the toilet and even to feed itself.
Sitting at the table where the meal is served, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He dares, even dares to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before the usual death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliation," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"In our lifetime we're taught that a man has to pee standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the Victoria-Gadbwa shelter.
Regressing to the status of the child is for some unbearable humiliation.
"All depends on the ability of the human" to settle down with the fall, he claims.
Because many people who are involved in palliative care believe that important events occur in the worst part of this decline.
Patients entering Victor Gadbwa's palliative shelter are all cancer-sick.
Forecasts lead them to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the doctor and nurse team is no longer providing assistance called "medical".
Mrs. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die in the consciousness of being killed.
But that's why the disease allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life," she says before allowing her to put on a breathing mask.
She is still waiting for her son's last visit from Italy in the near future.
In the host, Victor Hadbwa, a group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance.
It's a palliative care that remains when there's nothing more to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in the palliative aid institutions.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues as far as possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the nurses.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or emotionally.
We agree to provide the dying one with oral flakes from a brand or a pepsi, given that he will ask.
We don't have to control sugar anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we brought Mr. X. a beer that died tonight.
In the morning, his son got this beer in his legs and fell asleep.
"We help our loved ones as well as our patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care for the sick.
In the Victor Gadbau shelter, no one looks like the previous day.
A number of 93-year-olds who enjoy their last meeting with their family in the yard, lying on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die a young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two little children and trying everything to survive.
"In the last half of the year, between three and five chickens are always treated with cancer patients under 45 years of age," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Hadbwa shelter come from the house and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbwa and the Palliative Care Society of the Greater Montreal House, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this huge health gap in Quebec that causes many palliative care professionals to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanization and suicide assistance.
As of October, a manifesto signed by the palliative care lights, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, is circulating and shows that they disagree with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before a transition to euthanasia is permitted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hope of survival by Ellen Richard was at least minimal when she stopped the boring chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping fighting, she told me.
She told me my days were considered!
There is no universal care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who are dying are grateful to the hospital because they have not complied with their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely comprehensive in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Society of Palliative Care at the House of the Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to disease in 8 per cent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use a palliative session, where the patient falls asleep until death, either from time to time, or on a regular basis.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who are unable to relieve their pain will be able to have access to the palliative session.
Those who suffer from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized," it means "I want it to be easier for me."
This report was made possible by a journalist grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party collectors and Italian mafia experts tell us every day what they know about the huge “system” that is driving the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade union actors and mafios.
“Industry” was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system breaks up after all the money's been spent, Jack Dusheno, deputy and former Montreal police chief."
It was because of the scandal in 2011 that the investigation of official crime related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of Liberia, Jean-Share, at the time, had been very reluctant to accept.
The Dušeno Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only the Ministry of Transport would keep a billion dollars in contracts”, if some held back their instincts from taking part.
The Sharbonno Commission has already “set up two mayors”, he adds, hoping that it will be able to “discover the patterns of individuals”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was brought together by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, which was composed of extensive government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Special Unit of Molot, which had forced Montreal ' s stock cartel after 2009, to stop the contract price increase.
During the last few weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marktou, mayor of the small town, have been accused of fraud and corruption.
In turn, Jill Vayankur, recently retired from the position of Mayor Laval, the third of the city of Quebec.
It is suspected of being received on a number of occasions when public orders are placed.
In addition, the official indictment was filed with several communication engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito.
The last blasted the present bomb by investigating the “system” of receiving public contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to a Mafia mediator who, in turn, had transferred the money from Major Gerald Tramble's "United Montreal" party.
In the 2000s, Zambito spent money on the right and on the left, listing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various provincial parties, mainly the Liberals then in power.
He also recognized that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Consumables in which value is exceeded
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked unrelentingly.
Zil Suurprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736 000 in exchange for sewer contracts that he had overvalued.
Other road construction officials recognized that they had received a 30-40 per cent increase in account with false supplements.
Then an organizer of the Mary party, Martin Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget filled with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, loading Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of the River-de-Prère district in the east of the island, she has been opposed to the sale since 2010 of a municipal site purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million for construction works.
70 per cent of the dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in the investigation, which would eventually begin, she would “trace a thread that would allow the operation of a system that would rain with ants to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators”.
This process is characterized as “sick but positive”.
We are in the process of clearing the wounds, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid returning questionable practices.
We're going home.
Regular.
Jacques Dusheno notes, for his part, that “experts have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “election officials who know about this scheme” but who have not been involved in fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the election campaign in Quebec is 70 per cent, he jokes: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to $100 donations to parties, but it says it will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit the election costs, the policy will be dirty money.”
It requires a complete restructuring of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: “We cannot go down below; we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy, if we are brave”.
If this story reveals the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard...
"PZZ - not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you've reached an unusual range in the PSC.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual awareness, but may also be by a new measure of GSP.
Great games have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical personnel have also made many contributions.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's all happening very quickly in football.
But I'm not.
From the very beginning at the NIF pre-training centre in Clerfonten and until my arrival in St. Etien, I have always been walking forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition set up by Carlo Anchelotti...
The completion of this summer is not in the news to play a very high-level match.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a game like me wanting to be at the level and to be taught as much as possible.
Furthermore, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my position.
He's helped by substitutes like Claude McKalele, who played in the same position as me.
The officers are the owners of the situation?
Of course.
The officers shall respect all technical personnel.
He is not equal in the First League today, and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He had extensive experience, and he won many high-class titles.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had a encouraging conversation with him.
That's when I left the whole series of traumas.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSC season?
In the First League, Lion took the lead in us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been effectively qualified in an eighth final.
What's the club's goal in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Everything can be done now.
We will be able to say our word to the person with very good European teams.
We first want to finish the first in our group before Porto to be able to win a match in one eighth final.
Can the PSC become the first-class European club in the short term?
He's got a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, it is necessary for Paris to win titles and to strengthen its long-term position.
That's not true today.
The GSP has the financial means to make this project realistic.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to get this championship title.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We've finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points involve calling the champion.
But the other team, Monpel, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marcel, Leon and Bordo have entered the title struggle, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from the PSC?
It's normal that we're expecting a lot, given how much we've got and what games we've got.
We're fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home and we still find what to criticise, of course, it's a little upset.
We ask ourselves what people are looking for first.
We'll never be able to win every exit with a 4-0 account.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed in time.
We have proved at the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which is no longer two seasons long enough to go to one eighth final, even though they've also spent a lot of money!
Taking into account the amounts invested, we presented you at 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a neglect for our opponents and for the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who were not high last season, were “received” by these new PSCs.
This shows how attractive the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSC seems to be entirely dependent on the exaltation of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of "Golden Dependency."
It just means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he kills a lot of heads.
He came for it and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Where he was playing, he showed that he was a great game and a star of world scale.
In the group we respect him as a man and a toy.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is truly unique.
It stimulates others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the collection of France?
It's a disappointment.
I really wanted to be part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma has prevented me from wasting some time playing.
I've seen a lot of things out there, and I've gone from there.
Today I'm going to be able to play good volleyball matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was raised in the Blues.
We learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didi Desham in the head of the Blues?
They're effective for him.
He's got good positions in the world championship.
He's a strict coach, he's close to playing games and inspires victory.
What Lauren Blan was like.
But I don't want to compare.
Blan reached his goal, he qualified us in Euro.
I hope Didie Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
Good merit (1-1) in Spain, 16 October, is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career wasn't like that.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The full contradiction of the current cash exchange based on central banks recorded transactions between the parties receiving c commissions for their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, it is clear that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonim), is also a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euro...) and a protected exchange protocol for BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between participants at one level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites are being taken up by the beatings for the execution of donations or as a means of payment.
The Beatkona course, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell five months later to $2 before returning to about ten dollars today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared to world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
It describes the beatkon as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competition with the dollar or euro” and “like ordinary currencies”.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credit” used to promote video games that are developed in the game process or that can be purchased (at times and exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations always control and process a central body.
In Bitkon, all the net assets are also accountants, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address by providing anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the drums used in the transaction actually exist in the public account book sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It is based on the mathematical task of sending computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is a phase of file hashing, i.e. converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number before "hessing" it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, it is easy to check that it is correct.
The transaction is thus insensitive to the string of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the sake of deception, the user wished to pay twice the same amount of money, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that's working on the task gets 50 beats.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize will be divided regularly by half by the end of 2012.
The number of batons is therefore limited by 21 million, but they are divided into one hundred million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing capacity.
The life of the network has already been overflights and falls.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked and the battles were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money-paying company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this deficiency.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the book of accounts and found that almost 80 per cent of the battleheads are not in circulation.
Giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmkvist, who works at Coinabul, who is involved in the conversion of batons into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in present money) or a wireless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is a cheap way out.
The owner better controls his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just tell the address that can be photographed and identified by phone, explains Pierre Nuaza, making sure he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB intends to review the various risks that are considered to be high today in the event of the success of this system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Suroba).
NATO and the Americans should follow them in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just us.
We were affected mainly by Afghan Christians, whom we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and assembled.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of Christians who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, so that even they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are patient, sometimes supported by local rebels, but they will no longer be as sensitive as the West would be.
The withdrawal of the French army from the Nijarb base, which I observed from the heights of trees planted by mind trees through French credits, was well done.
The convoys of trucks and armoured aircraft accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of fighting between different groups.
They were then taken under the control of the country as their kind of liberation, return to security.
The Afghan women paid for the obscurity of these Christians, in which Al-Qaeda overcame them, but their situation did not improve today.
Former Mojaheids, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in subjection.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into delinquents occupying public land to resell them to repatriates who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not even fought.
The people I heard in the rural area want a government that wouldn't be made of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have taken American generosity: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people have given up on war and its ideology.
They lived in a modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the population.
State schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed fighters, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
The army is now here.
The authorities that will command it will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial women who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to some extent, according to the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the Prime Minister's post, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, beginning in the 1950s, and even earlier, depended on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on foot, nor does any thickness work, nor has any irrigation system been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the Thirty Years of War, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
It has been heard that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only strengthened the feeling that the Western countries were present only to take possession of them.
Without the energy to process iron or copper on the ground, without the means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of useful fossils.
The Chinese have almost left the Mess Aynak media, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to demolish a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, on one wonderful day.
The French military units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archeological delegation.
Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in ten mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intense involvement of local labour, have helped to keep up the rise: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and increased desert areas.
What do we keep in mind when we spend two billion euros on military expenditures?
Much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural works from local communities in the province of Capis.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what farmers wanted, as they told me, it was necessary to provide them with little non-military support that would be well-controlled and direct to them.
Severe births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risk step taken by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt was more than ever divided on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it decided to play a va-bank.
After all, he announced on Wednesday that the Conciliation Assembly would vote on the final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the country ' s division.
In the opinion of his opponents, the President insisted on his “autocracy” continuing “to violate the word” and “to support the right”.
His followers were convinced in the camp that this was a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transitional process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the Brothers to give up their intention to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is booming across the country.
Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians are voting positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The more the call for an accelerated vote goes to the ultimate of the Egyptian people: " Either you vote for my text, or I leave an extraordinary mandate," which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Inaugural Assembly, mostly Islamic, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to give their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To achieve the required quorum, 11 reserve participants were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, for example, took note of the fact that one of the few differences of day had arisen around... time for prayer, since some members of the Committee felt that the times of the Inaugural Assembly were wrong.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2 eventually remained the same article from the 1971 Constitution, which stated that “the principles of the Sharia are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties for which the implementation of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement hoped to replace the “principles” with “rules” which would allow them to be applied more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other participants in Egyptian society.
"Licemere" is the answer to the liberals who see only the pier.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Shariat law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Memory, this is alarming, i.e. “People who are meant to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the origin of theocracy."
Many Liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next director of this university seems to be somewhere less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not interested, but people with university education, some have learned in the French system" - Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that “about article 220 may arise inconsistencies, since the terms used therein are borrowed from religious lexicons.
This applies, in particular, to the "fix" [Islamic case law, preamble].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to decide on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday was criticized for giving the President of the Republic broad authority.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another moment of dispute: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be considered, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the courts of civil persons be prohibited in military courts, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be a loss for freedom.
Liability for blasphemy has been maintained and abuse is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles spoke of the protection of women, Heba Moraef said, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive moment was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to be speaking yesterday evening on television, the demonstrations are scheduled for the second afternoon.
In turn, the Heads of State will go out on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pop Earth and sea from the desert
The Promised Land unites itself with the vastness of Bible truth, modern comfort, and natural affection.
“Aif” has given five of the most important reasons for being in Israel.
Worship in Sacred Places
The Jordan River is to be visited, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all those who enter this “cup” will enjoy God’s favor.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine, walking through water, filling up clouds, and filling up the nets.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples, and after his resurrection.
But most of the temples in Jerusalem.
The believers here follow the Path of Scorby or the Cross Path of Jesus (in Latin, Via Doloroz).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia, Pretoria, where there was a court, and on the streets of the Old City it leads to the tomb of the Lord at Mount Golgotha, to the place of Dispersion, the Stone of the Anointed One, and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here, then, is a symbolic Christian pope of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be raised to a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree from which Jesus was crucified grew.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Stone of Placa, who left the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
By tradition, people of different faiths leave here notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Perform vertical travel
The ruins of Massada fortress remained hidden from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on the rocky cliffs in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are involved in alpineism can reach their destination.
The rest are delivered on this historic peak by the canal.
And in the north of the country, there is a famous Hermon mountaineering resort, where in the winter months there is a huge flow of tourists.
He's got a bus shuttle from the foothills.
The total length of the mountain range is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, on the top of the mountain, the pagan gods lived.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You're not going to all of us for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located not far from Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Cumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
Its exhibition features a wide range of impressionists and expressionists from Mone, Pissarro, Renoara, Sezanne, Sisley, Matissa, Modiliani, Shagala, Picasso.
Akka can be found at the Al Basha Ban Museum, which is represented by several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with a crowd of visitors and bankers at that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth entering the unique Rally Museum, where you can love the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir beds.
Access is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Jad-Vasham in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the Children ' s Memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in child shelters and gas chambers.
You're going into it, and you're going into absolute darkness.
The stars are in motion.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healing
The three main resort areas of Israel are on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each has swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphins and oceanariums.
It is interesting that even in winter, the Red Sea is bathed because the water temperature is not lower than 21 °C and the air is heated to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it is bathed for a year.
This is, by the way, the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet, 417 m below the ocean level.
The laurel in it is a solution that can easily hold onto the blue even those who are unable to swim at all.
Landscape around is not really beautiful.
They come here to take a course of treatment with salt water, rape, and febrile dirt, and to treat health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to bring the nerves under control.
Touch the secrets of ancient times
They are kept by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous Sea route that unites Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Persia saved the beauty of Andromeda, with which they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of making use of the tiny beads called Zodiac signs.
They say if you go to the walls on the street of your sign, Fortuna's gonna be kind.
Young women from all over Israel and even other countries can be found in Jaffo.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can enjoy the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusades.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourist on the note
When moving to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
Money on the trip is better than in the euro, but in dollars that are easy to exchange on cheques (now $1 - 3.8.).
City transport is mainly bus, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram and in Haife is the only metro in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City to the Upper.
Actually, it's a underground funicular.
All types of urban transport have 6 cycles, which can be carried over for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is celebrated on Saturday night.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
And the Sunday morning begins on Sunday.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic and poultry, in which milk is compatible with meat.
It offers a wide selection of berries and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, and mollusk nuts, falalal, fruit and vegetables.
There are no boat dogs on the streets of the cities of Israel.
That's why a lot of fattened basketball that's just playing on their own.
They can be seen in the evening even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ants love human places and do not give up hospitality.
Car rentals, depending on the brand, range from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike's going to be broken into 15 checkpoints a day.
Tickets in the museum are on average 30 shekels.
Number
In 2012, Israel visited more than three million tourists worldwide.
Most of the time, US citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest.
In the Promised Land from January to October 2012, there were 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, 51 per cent more of the 2010 figure, until the visa was cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Great and possible" will lead to Moscow: migrants are digging money into language
As long as MPs and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing will be passed, frauds that trade “lipe” certificates have already appeared in the country
In Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia, 13 million gastarbayers arrive annually.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the remaining families.
As of 1 December, a law entered into force whereby each migrant worker would be required to pass a Russian language examination.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing, housing and retail.
However, in time, promised by the IMF, tests will become mandatory for all arrivals.
It would then be necessary not only to give up language but also Russian history and the framework of legislation.
The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for receipt and for extension of the permit to work.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where the Russian language is a State.
The law does not apply to persons who have been successful in obtaining certificates and diplomas of education prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, accountability and protection of rights
The network of examinations will work under the auspices of the Russian-language Institute of Puškin, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the ITU, the SPC and other Russian unions.
Migrant testing will be possible in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative was supported by both the Members of Gosmund and the FMS.
And here are the human rights defenders before the law came into force, many times they have been able to ask the question in the press: what is that?
What will change the knowledge of the language for both Russians and for tourists themselves?
First of all, the migration service is responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from “hard slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Head of Mission of the Russian FMS in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
There are problems with migrants without a profession, education that does not know a language that does not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding of the language, - sure Sebelev - the future migrant is doomed to encounter people who, in the form of assistance, will move him to a yellow tight bar, where he and his ten likes will spend months without food and documents, ranging from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one by their parents, and they are deceived by their arrival, they choose passports, they do not pay the promised salary," said the head of the head of the Labour Migration Administration of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't pray, consignor!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who collect their earnings in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country in which they are seeking it, but also write to their own people with hard work.
Of course, it is not as much their fault as it is: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajiks can afford to get even such primary education.
For their families have something to eat, not to wear, wear, or have children in school.
As a young person grows older, such children are sent to work for the first time.
It's hard if you don't know the language, they're gonna admit it.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
It is true that the human rights defenders' language law is one important point.
Only those migrants who have legal status will be tested.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastarbians still live in Russia illegally.
"Good welcome, or the side entrance is banned"
Many of the arrivals claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucracy and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is worth 12 to 16,000 rubles.
And there's a fake registration that can be made fast and almost half a thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, no warrants and cases.
"A hundred percent, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists from Tajikistan's citizen Umed Huškadamov.
"Flight, don't gather, buy a living."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that there were not only migrant registration documents.
Several “lipe” certificates for language tests have already been seized by FMS staff.
Sub-papers are printed on a standard colour printer.
Of course, they did not become the new owners: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier to pass the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is twice the cost of the formal test procedure: it will cover the migrant in three thousand.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that “shorts” cannot be simply bought, collected by government representatives and human rights defenders.
As long as the authorities can promise hostmen who fail to pass the test for the first time, it is time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
The MDG does not engage in the illicit arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very low
The Russian IMF proposes to strengthen the law on the holders of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To shoot at the weddings when there was no victims, and to the fight set up by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to prohibit the wearing of injuries in public places and increase the age from which weapons licences can be obtained from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the thought committee on security and anti-corruption of Irina Yarova and promised that amendments to the arms law would be made to Gosmud in the near future.
It's not enough that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by screwing them up.
There was an open letter on the network, whose authors, representatives of various public shooting organizations, were required to renounce “unreasonable tightening”.
The percentage of hooliganity with registered weapons is minimal, according to Russian bi-sy lawyer Vasili Lesnikov.
According to the IMF statistics, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes involving firearms registered in internal affairs were committed, while 1168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of civil-weapon legislation does not place a criminal on the black market.
Now, according to them, we can find any weapon at a low price in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the CDM claims to control the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "Black" arms market is filled through several channels.
The main channels are five, reported by Colonel Victor Baranez, who has been working for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Gender.
Screening of a site that receives orders for weapons
The first is an army or military pursuit, which was stolen during fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons have also been tested by Russian officers, and by the Caucasians themselves," said Baranec.
The next type of "black weapon" was stolen by criminals from force forces.
The Baranec explains that both police warehouses and law enforcement personnel are stolen.
Illicit “starchs” are sold from military warehouses.
In many military camps, explosions have often occurred.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires have been made especially to cover the lack," said the former soldier.
According to Baranza, they are bringing in weapons manufacturers.
"There are now private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and that are putting guns out of the field on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
There are particularly many guns and machines from poor countries, such as Kyrgyz.
"It has its own production, sometimes artificial, and it has been formed by a mafia who has organized a stream," explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have considered what an approximate proportion of each of the sources of supply of illicit weapons to the "black" market.
The report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design in 2011.
Experts analysed the reporting of the MDGs and Russia, criminal literature and open-ended weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers, from the army and from the force agencies.
Half of all weapons in the black market have been found “to blame for arms-related officials”, the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of arms cases come from armed conflicts, 14 per cent from arms production, and 5 per cent from Black Archaeology.
The seller of one of the weapons stores, who has asked not to name him, is convinced that the weapons found by black miners have not been bought for a long time - too old.
Most of the time, as he says, the sellers are going to the war camp for a new party.
A person buys a unit through a flag, such as a TT gun.
They write it down, they pass it through a trap.
"He carries her to town and sells 900 euros here for two stores," he says.
"It is true that the police are in all cases, so periodically when a crime detection plan is being set up, illegal arms dealers are under control," the consultant adds.
"As in a fancy store."
The seller and the buyer usually find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at sites, blogs, until I got back from a partner who offered to come to the platform "God" where there's going to be a man who's going to take me to the corner, where we're going to trade.
The price of the barn was only there.
Military Inspector Victor Baranec
I need someone I know who's got a way out, a salesman tells me.
There are sellers on the market, but there's also to come, on condition, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell his daughter that the tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of castes now because of the man I'm convinced of.
He only puts them on me, too, because he knows I won't give it up.
Newspapers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranec tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared to publish an article on it.
The schemes, he says, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where "all that's good."
"I felt like I was in a fancy store," remembers the soldier.
The buyer, Baranza says, doesn't offer a cat in the bag - everything can be tried.
I'm a potential client. I'm not just buying. We're going with a salesman in the woods.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are working well, we're starting to trade," says the expert procedure.
A couch shop
Internet searches include sites and groups in "Contact " where they offer to buy weapons " for different purposes.
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising hat on the "Buy a gun or a machine".
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
What about selling to minors?
"Without a license, of course," asked the user Ivan.
"Tt.Moscow Cup" is a laconically formulated request for "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has now launched a huge network of base sites that are willing to buy weapons of war with shovels.
People go like hungry fish to eat and then get into Siberia the corner.

I have heard about these schemes: the website is usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photograph and instruction where weapons are hidden," said the public secretary of the arms law organization Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranec claims that if you leave the application on the web, you can remain unarmed and fall behind the grid.

Makeovers for $100
For the purchase of illegal small arms, experts estimate the amount of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitria Kislova of the Arms Law organization, the Makarova gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It'll take a month and a half.
It is discharged from long-term storage by the management of those medium-sized stores.
According to official statistics from January to October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7 per cent and amounted to 22.9 thousand and the number of detected theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fastfoot workers and supermarkets build in the United States
MacDonald's work leads to the fourth of all American adolescents
In recent days in America, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart's universities and restaurants of popular fast food networks, such as MacDonalds, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chichen.
Until no one is expected to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or be forced to breathe at early stages.
The actions support trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by several Walmart workers and fast-food systems, the aim of protestors is to establish trade union organizations.
The economic sector has not yet been covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The shares started last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, captured by millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by bribes.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, in which 2.2 million people around the world are working, left their jobs and took sides with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's store, the goods of which are counted on people of modest and medium-sized means.
Walmart sells everyone in the light, from mushrooms, hunting roses and motor batteries to pollen, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores averaged 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are recovered only from work.
The availability and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow himself to sell goods in part because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complains about difficult working conditions, such as lack of auto-loaders or manual scanners.
Shareholders in Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and indicated that the value of the health insurance provided by the corporation had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee, who received $9.5 an hour, didn't pay the rent, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart would raise the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on pay now.
If Walmart is able to fully transfer the wages to the buyer's shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents of the price.
In a year, they're going to spend some $12.39 more than right now.
The Walmart partners note quite well that the protests have taken place only in nine states and have not caused any minor damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued at her shops from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the following day, while Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
In total, its cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman, in an interview with the Huffington Post, said that the jobs had been abandoned in a total of “less than five” Walmart staff, and that the protest was the only “precious pirate trick” organized by its trade union.
"A free bag!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not the Walmart universities (which are not complained about in this progressive city, and therefore are not here yet) and McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York Forest
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but they are poor, and on average, they receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less of them in this road town.
As much as there can be in New York for such money, it's impossible for me.
Once through MacDonalds, I've been hearing about the fact that the four American teenagers who have been working on after school have been working for them, living with their parents.
Few have seen this major source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly interviewing McDonald's employees, who complain that they have to live for this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum, a comment is hung, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protest participants, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-fooders start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. more than doubled their current minimum wage.
They also required the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of fast food.
The American Law prohibits administrations from obstructing and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult and objective to cover fast food from the trade union.
One of the main is the unusual flow of personnel.
Non-conformity
Noise protests took place on that day and in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The action culminated in a meeting at McDonald's in the middle of the day next to the Times Square, where several local democrats, in particular a member of the Jumaine Williams forest, who said: "Macdonalds says he sells billions of portions and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and does not pay you for honest work."
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the mayor of Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must make a friendly contribution to the support of fast-food workers in order to obtain a fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described in the New York Times, this was the largest act of this kind in the history of the American field of fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people in it, but not all of them were rapid survey workers, in which tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It's not clear if this spark of mass movement is going to give birth.
"To deceive the brain is a medium."
The popular theme of complementary reality among modern technology lovers has recently been adopted mainly through the prism of special points.
At its annual conference early in the summer, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft submitted an application for the patent in question.
However, the interview with the head of an interactive 3D technology group in the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi suggests that the eyepiece is a phase of life for scientists in this company.
Their perspective is to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me in general what your research team is doing.
- We're dealing with human interaction with cars, but we're trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind in mass has been stuck at the stage of working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes with its thumbs.
We would like to look five or ten years ahead and anticipate a radical change in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox plugin and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because everyone is interested in harsh management.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has transferred interaction to the physical level, so far much has been done on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion has not yet been much.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release a computer world into our physical world to make it more vulnerable.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more comfortable way.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice management?
Popular stuff, but aren't they overestimating it?
He certainly cannot be called a panacea - a matter of privacy, because he does not always want to inform the environment about his actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each one in its own nest.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about flimsy ones, but about such expensive, short ones.
The gestures were recorded, not by the device camera, but by the hand bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
As long as he's big, but theoretically, he can be reduced to the size of his hours.
But in general the future for the mixed type of management, for example, gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this gas bank?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual relationship.
In the near future, I think we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to identify more accurately human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they give you a good depth clearance, it's very important.
- If you're talking about your Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Don't you have enough permits, depth or anything?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be distinguished from our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 k/s.
But it's not in the megapixels itself, it's as a matrix and as a depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not only the X and Y axis clearance, but also Z.
It's also a very important speed, the number of staff per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are very low, especially for gestures.
Steven Betisses of our Redmond Laboratory made a sensor of regulated delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would very much like the equivalent of such a device in my work, but it does not require that staff be increased in a second.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- There are now three cameras in Kinect, one of which is actually an infrared trigger, and the other is a signal receiver.
And here's the third camera. It's actually a normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required calculation.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the criminal position of the cameras and see how this would help in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- How much I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her eyes to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the everyday use of sophisticated eye-realities technologies, it's one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, always to play, holding a smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think it would be the coolest option to be the "passing" added reality when you could switch from point to point to point to a smartphone, a projection display and beyond.
The eyes are a very personal device, with their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time, weakness - the added reality on the basis of the eyes will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also to the mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: There is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh account of human and machine breakthroughs.
I think the eighth could be an addition of touchy feelings.
While one of the interesting tricks is using the second hand as a facet for the image.
She's doing a good job of recording the pressure!
But there are technologies that are really designed to add to these "air-carts" vulnerabilities -- for example, the interference of several ultrasonic cases at a certain point where there is a finger -- gives you a feeling, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like you've been hit by a trigger.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in your fingers - also a promising direction.
- Did you try to fool the brain?
To make him think he feels what kind of person he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried.
There is another task to be tackled for a long time, such as forcing a person physically in a very limited space, believing that he is on an open, virtually endless path, working and on the concepts of running roads (not only in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge tracks.
As long as the brain is being deceived by the average, work is still much more for many years.
This is what works on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- many things in an absolutely initial state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the Peterburg Avant-garde project on the future of citizens in the cultural and artistic avant-garde.
The top list has already caught up with the bright actors of the Petersburg Art scene whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe by passing all-Russian knowledge.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the empathic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kiril Miller, a bearded man, dressed in all the red that meets him at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Now, at the fashion fairs and refurbishments.
Kiril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of viewers wherever they don't show.
Kirill Miller is one of the fundamentally Peterburg socio-philosophical speakers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man at the end of the '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
He is also the man of the city, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile in the city, which lifts everyone’s spirits.
He had recently taken in his hand the charm and became a Petersburg charmer, for he had nurtured for this difficult role all of his divine existence, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why are you still walking around the city all over the red, not in yellow or red, for example?
- I've chosen a red color as a model that deals with species and images.
In this world, color is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and society.
Although everything in society is not as bad as it sounds, it is a cause for aggression and a lack of good character.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
- When did you know he was supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the D.C. Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I knew this was my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and the new, free types of me were unconcerned.
I began to associate with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonry that led to the Puškinsky-10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me into the theater, clothes, music, all the genres, except for the words.
And all of this came together in your Art Clinic... and it was important for me to feel at the centre of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took over the territory of Puškinska-10, and until there was no repair, there was a music and art club, a religious club, a house of the Petersburg godmother.
Many were born there: Noma, Tekila jazz, I remember how Snura brought with the project "Echo Van Goga".
Snur and his friends sang light songs under the flag, they were in a succulent trick, among them was the modern composer Igor Vodin.
When the group played live, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programmes until the days of Hali-gali.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and we took him to a great career, and we got him basic education and education.
"D 137" gallery, Griboedov Club, is an art clinic.
That's where our workers went and always went.
I'm a yesterday's hero when culture meant something.
In 2000, the interview was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the name of "The Hunger of the Year," I was named, my culmination was over.
In new times, old rules have failed to work, I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your job is a familiar way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a sharp sense of relevance and sharpness.
I'll have a program show, the Russian Museum in the Clones.
The clowns are an interim category.
I used to be social, and now being like this is painful and scary.
But the clowns get all blown up, the tragedy gets taken away.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace through totalitarian redeployment.
They are now wearing clothing, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Maybe you can't hand him a hand and spit in the rose.
And the lie will be removed with the help of a refurbishment.
We've seen you recently as a city charmer.
Who, like me, will be.
- Well, can commercial art be beautiful?
- Business art must now be accurate, tactical, sweet.
There's a disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people fell into a room, a god loved one, a simple one.
Now it's all broken into micro-society, now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a doll paper, so everybody likes it.
Now we need to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 worshipers.
- And Stas Mikhailov's coming for a few thousand!
- He's got a lot of chips coming in. There's a sex-social field working.
And on the cultural floor, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and as a result less management, money, everything will breathe.
I've got worshipers, mostly not cheated, not cheated.
I wrote paintings in my youth that one collector had them on the wall next to Falc and Larryon.
I started with a picture that usually ends.
It's a lot of misunderstandings.
They say: culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money to paint paintings.
I'm such a culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an officer of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
At the right kings, kings may not have understood much in culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're forced, because they need higher experts who can properly assess and guide these experts.
Now it's delicious.
The same is true of Erart, but they are distinguished by what they say honestly that not all modern art we take are artists who have to look for themselves at other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more culture in Moscow. There's land.
And on our rocks, it's hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people who are curious in Europe who go to shows, concerts.
We've got this layer of ton.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented by St. Petersburg Grant
Born in Space
The land is in danger.
Global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
Spacecraft with grounders on board are headed to search for a spare planet.
In order to preserve mankind, is there a major question about how to continue in marriage or on the same protective planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, this planet is only two that can be assumed at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars" is considered the senior scientist of the State Astronomical Institute of the name of P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live on high altitudes or on Venus orbits... in space.
This approach to reproduction in space begins with the flora.
A year and a half ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of the mountain range were no different from their earthly breeds.
Then, in the orbit of the infected, tiny fruit fly-drosophile.
In 1979, eggs were fertilized into space to check how the embryo develops in pregnancy.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird coming out.
And that's where the problem begins.
“The problem of the bird’s need for support is to stand on its feet and start moving,” explains the head laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sichev.
I can't find any support, the birds are indisputably cooking.
And 10 hours later, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds didn't respond to the light and the sound.
And the trouble was that in four days they just died.
"And twice we pulled out birds, then we gave up because it's just impossible to work with them," says the experiment with birds in the space Vladimir Sichev.
With animals last time, the biological "minenic" flew to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiment will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, there will be only one-field persons on the Bion biosport.
There was a crisis experiment that had already been sent to space with fruit.
In principle, they found nothing supernatural there.
"That's how it was on the biosports, but again it's a single experiment, and such studies have to be conducted," says Vladimir Sichev.
After the landscaping of space crises, a seed appeared.
But the problem of reproduction is not yet solved directly in outer space.
It's a simple task.
Animals, losing their normal habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
A man, unlike a beast, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract mind, and is able to create a pleasant emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women in space have been flying for 50 years.
The greatest risk was in Tereskov.
And the most precious thing that humans have is a woman's organism.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could say if he'd stay after flying into space.
If she can have a baby after that flight.
"No one has answered this question," says the veteran of the Wachtang Wakhandze rocket industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentin Terreskova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savicka, the second woman in space, was born a son, twice in orbit and even in open space.
However, risks remain.
We don't have a few units, there are cosmonauts that have all happened after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," concludes the spacecraft Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valerie Polakov.
However, mankind needs to look for ways of biotechnologies, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of flight preparation.
This is where the cosmonauts develop open space working skills.
Water imitates miscarriage.
If for adult water, let it be comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for breast-feeding children, it's a natural.
Little volunteers like to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months away from the mother in the surrounding fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the guide.
In principle, this is logical because from the time of birth, from the time of the first bath, it takes only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says Marine Axen's chest swim instructor.
In a word, if the infant’s virginity is more natural, she needs gravity and weight.
Very quickly in the womb, the muscles of life, the tasa, fall into the ability to produce.
All right, let's take this off, based on the birth-stimulators.
Of course, in a special camera to go to birth, she'll kick him out.
"And what else?" asked Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth’s inclination, the body does not form a skeleton and a muscle system.
It is not possible for a newborn to wear a special load suit for training as an adult.
He's just going to be deprived of what he's going to need.
"And this experiment that we're going to go with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, totally de-adapted person to Earth," said the head of the IMBP Bioethics Committee RAN Igor Pestov.
So far the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
In time, however, this will be a reality when the earth on its ships is moved to a distant planet that will become a home for their offspring born in space.
Head of the Chief Audit Office: The failure of the system of fraud has been due to politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, remains in its application.
This statement was made by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, for an interview with Aktuální.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we don't have enough," commented Kala's current situation.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practices, Peter's approach to the so-called corruption system is sometimes called.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Citizen Democratic Party) would not worry about the verifications of businesses - is this prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be laid down in some way, and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister must not oppose the work of institutions that are required to verify and enforce obligations”, says Cala.
At the audit committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly was this about?
It means a parallel check that we started two years ago.
I simply say that European legislation supports how public procurement should be carried out, national legislation should be followed and applied in practice as well.
All the information was collected and, even in the case of an uncompleted check, interesting differences were found - simply to say, we can have legislation "exactly and without mistake", but in practice we are leaving Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you what it means to you?
That is how joint control can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, as this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid wealth and possibly criminal conduct.
But it's not the fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing the limit of orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with paper so that those who want to find a lasagna in this system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the German control system work?
Is there an organization such as our CRO (Control and Audit) or does it work otherwise?
With regard to institutions, there is also the Bundesrecunungshof, which is based on our principle, there is a college that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions operate similarly.
Moreover, authority to a certain extent is similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal land levels - their system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal chambers of account.
As for local legislation, it's easier there than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said that it is best at all.
That's because they're better at controlling?
It's definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like these comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from our cooperation with our office, would they?
When it comes to domestic legislation, how have your institution been affected by the amendment to the Government Procurement Act?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short enough, it has not yet appeared in our control work.
Since we are actually controlling the facts, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we have started using our new instrument "to detect the risk of ineconomy" through which we have pursued almost 14,000 public contracts, we have analysed them, and of course, these changes will occur because restrictions are changing, changing the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or further burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules “will become more severe” and cannot be complied with.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes with the regional board) that any non-compliance with the State Procurement Act means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is the law, then, to be tightened in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who wish to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the solution.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let's make sure this road won't lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the GDP will not concern business operators with the so-called corruption system.
"Swarz-system" prohibited or authorized?
The law should be laid down in some way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister should not oppose the work of the bodies that are required to verify and enforce obligations.
We can say, "We change this law and let it go," but we can't say that we're going to pretend that nothing happens.
The Government Procurement Act contains fairly strict rules, as should be formally implemented, and that is correct, which protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we don't have enough.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly walking, but somewhere more careful.
Karlovarian border
This morning the roads in Karlovara border were passing, but somewhere cold and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but should be slightly warm during the day.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, but there is only a small layer in the bottom.
However, on the hills of the Red Mountains lies about 30 centimeters [30 cm] of snow.
The information received from road workers in the area was known to indicate that the areas were less visible because of the fog.
The R6 and the first-class roads in the region are currently underway without restrictions.
However, attention needs to be given, for example, to bridges where the surface may be frozen and shallow.
All roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are also available.
But in some of their areas, the remains of the frozen and run - down snow still lie.
Special attention should be paid to the roads on the highroads.
Paradobic and Royal Town
The Czech Roads and Highways Office on its websites informs that some streets in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by golides, while some of the high roads and roads may be snow-dried.
Regional road workers warn drivers of the holode, which can be formed especially at the elevations of the Paradubic region.
Gololed can be around Lanschkron, Usti-sur-Orlici, Polički, Switavi or High-Myto especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
The routes I/43 and I/34 in Switzerland are treated by chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonos and Orlicks Mountains.
The snow-dried layer is on the roads at the elevations in the Rihnova-sur-Knegen and Trutnova areas.
In East Czech Republic today, the cloud is variable without sediment.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pulsenian border
Roads in the Plzeň region are passing this morning, but places need to be cautious and adapt to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent chilling in some places, it may be slippery.
The driver’s seats may be exposed to fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 show is now almost unrestricted, but road managers are recommending caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In the south of Plsni and Tahov, the frozen areas may fall.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and in this case there is also a warning about the possibility of collapsing sites.
Leaders should be careful, especially on the few roads used in the area of Shumawa.
The Olomoucian End
Leaders leading to the highlands of Olomouk must take into account the snowfall on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Sea and on the road towards Videl Krsij.
At night, snowflake forced road workers to leave, according to road management information, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperke.
In other areas along the road, there are usually no restrictions.
"On the heights of the Sumperka lies the remains of the snow.
The leaders on the side of Esenika must bear in mind the presence of snowflakes in the Red Sea," ČAN (Czech News Agency) said today.
On the night when the roads were cleared, their colleagues from Essen, assured them that the roads were bare and wet after treatment of chemicals.
In Olomouce, roads are unrestricted, but in Steinberg, drivers must be careful in forest areas where moisture remains.
Oral border, Liberian border
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that a few difficult places remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several ice-cream or snow-flakes, a mountain road is closed at the Telnica area at the Clinic in Usteck country.
The temperature is also negative in the lows, so there is snow and ice on the roads. In the lows, especially to the south-east of the Czech Republic, there are no problems, roads mainly dry.
The road complications are not yet reported.
Road workers report the appearance of holodecks in the county.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for his education at night: the rain and the cloud of snow all day long, the sky became clear at night, and the freezing began.
Unfavourable conditions were reported on the main roads and on track I/13 on the border between Usteck and Liberia.
Because of the snow-covered trees on the road, they were forced to close the road at the Palnice.
Simon Ornest: At concerts we want to store positive energy
What do you think should happen less than a month later?
It's just one of many disturbing news that we people are so easily confronted.
Together with the The Tap Tap group, we are constantly joking on this topic and we are saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you please tell your readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which was announced at the end of December 21st at 11:10.
For the day before that event, three concerts were held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava on 20 December at 21:00 in parallel.
They're going to end up saying cruelly, at a time when the Mayan calendar will be completed on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone will be 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who's got that idea?
Originally, it was my idea, and we've all come up with our artist González Augustus.
In addition to the fact that we want to store enough positive energy and prevent the end of the light, we also want to think with the public about how this world will ever be passed on to our children.
In the event of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, shoes, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These items can be purchased on www.e-tap.cz and thus provide support.
The Tap Tap Group along with other musicians also filled the gymnastics against the end of the light, which is called "the end of the light cancels".
Will your favorite YouTube audiences sound at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, in the end, if everything is finally done and the end of the light is not coming.
It will be delivered by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
Gymnasiums will also sound in the direct atmosphere of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written and played by Jesus in the video Tomas Hanak, also participating in Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other individuals in Czech cultural life, as we carry out many charitable activities and concerts.
We are actively trying to connect them to these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like to work with us, they're interested.
What will be the breakfast from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the free education centre STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the civilian association Tap at the Edlikka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Edlikka Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
Within the framework of the further construction project of the Edlikka Institute, there will be a separate building in which we will move with the project.
There will be several music groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to establish a programme that interests all generations, including children.
For example, Chinese, Support Lesbiens, Illustratesphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irži Suhi will take part in Prague.
Both details can be found on www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “magnificent activities” in the future?
In May, for the first time, we will be at the Prague Spring Festival and, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The following year, we would be pleased to introduce ourselves to the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were to be in the United States, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
In view of the border you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited capabilities.
How do you deal with the way of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks at first sight.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage room, plus a large number of trucks and tools boxes.
However, while they were dealing with it without any problems, the Czech ČSA and British Airways aircraft were always very well prepared for us, which I was surprised to see how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with people with disabilities and so on.
What have you been dealing with right now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that we are still at the base level in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are many barriers, and there are still people in the wild on the electric wheelchair in the city centre.
There is also no banishment of such things as taking the road to the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw attention to people with limited opportunities.
What, on the contrary, should we always do the best we can?
There's a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with a heavy form of disability move on their own in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
It's not very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities are actively participating in public life, and so are we with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or freedom is one thing, but when well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, everything will really change.
As long as these are unique cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but let's go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlikka Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician and I'm also playing on the saxophone, I've organized an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our leading Lady Angelovic says, it's a little out of control (Laughter).
The popularity has come only in recent years, or do I have something to do with it?
That is true, it has helped us to join well - known singers and to work actively on promoting the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess is as if it does not exist.
Through the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did the goal stand before you to unravel The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential to do something unusual.
In the show business, it's a whole thing that reflects each other.
It's logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it's been a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, of course...
But this grief is far too much, because people with limited opportunities are not some suffering and all the abandoned ones we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something, it's not only for them, it's for society as well.
Has it been a success to be a strict leader, as many of you think?
If we want to do our job in a qualitative way, we must be in many things uncompromising and have certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic imagination and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, there are twenty people in the The Tap Tap group.
How many were there in early 1998?
There's only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place on the day before the expected end of the day, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 2 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, in Brno - at the Fléda and Ostrave Club - in the centre of Plynoem with 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by a telecom at the time of the song group The Tap Tap “The End of the Light Is Canceled”.
The aim of the project is to raise funding of SEK 25 million for the purchase of multifunctional wireless equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlikka Institute in Prague.
The ticket for the concert is 400 kroner, for children under 12 years of age. Tickets can be purchased in Bohemiaitique.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and actively participated in a number of Agency projects over the years.
But the way to the cosmos of Poland began much earlier.
By the time World War II, Polish enthusiasts had traveled into space, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, which on 6 December 1933 presented to Warsaw's astronomical observatory the idea of his innovative work "Introduction into cosmonautique".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience with an open mind, and a few years later Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri's award and Andre Luis Hirsch for "Introduction into spacecraft".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major advocate of astronomy and cosmonautism.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a famous world propagandist of cosmonautism, and his contribution was assessed, including that one of the craters on the other side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a missile - equipped railway vehicle was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as was the project ' s details.
It is not even clear that a missile should have been used to drive or to brake the vehicle.
The information about this site is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has been thinking about rockets.
The study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzyck.
The remaining materials show that the studies have come to a stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialized press came up with the idea of a photo-electric missile by Rogozinski, and the following year, the work "Air Torpedo and Air Bomb" by the author of Leviva-Kzioblockko was released.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
The Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (the Temporary Committee of the Doradczo-Naukowa) was involved in all projects for the military use of missile technology before the war.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, work was completed as a result of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on space was published in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polish Astronautic Society).
For the first time, it was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problem, where four articles on astronomy were published.
In one of them, Professor M. Sobotovic suggested that a society be organized to deal with space science.
At the time, the projects of artificial satellites were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, Polish Astronautic Society (POA) has tried to enter the International Astronautic Federation (based in 1951) and has become its true member in the fall of the POA.
And next year, the first President of POA Kazimez Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Raketa Meteorologicnza), which has become the first Polish research rocket.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first was launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket capable of overcoming 1800 m was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was subsequently built and two-stage RM-2 rocket tests were conducted in the Black Desert in 1959.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of doing this scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could exceed 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high wind.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type successor was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket with a total length of 510 cm and a primary weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (described as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different from the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B - 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C - 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight distance for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to extract a useful load of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s accession to COSPAR in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermasevski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Law on Public Works.
The decision sparked a lively discussion in society.
There is no doubt that it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and free, free movement of private capital along with unencumbered financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the labour force (wage) a price tension arises.
In this sense, it is necessary to understand the situation when the manufacturer, through the delivery of the cheap goods, tries to stay in economic competition by “suffering” the value of the competitor in order to take away most of the market and thus increase his own income.
This means, on a large scale, for the majority of entrepreneurs either transferring production abroad or cheap purchases abroad or disappearing, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable costs of the State for social needs are increasing.
In general, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of employers to pay taxes and thus compensates for the public economic and social damage they suffer in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well-known that there is no need for specific statistics.
Unsceremonised private capital practices create a situation at the level of the economies of individual States where Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are giving their own population a share of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes to existing legislation.
The goal is to make its people economically subject to the dictation of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty increases, and the difference between the poor and the rich also increases.
For several years there has been a public distribution of products to poor people who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching millions.
In the context of increasing competitiveness, German economies are constantly faced when people in employment are paid such a wage that the State must pay them to obtain a minimum of living.
Such a scandal has also become public knowledge in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU States undoubtedly result in the same situation where people under the pressure of a fall in social status are forced either to migrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to be paid at the expense of society, hoping that private investment will ever come into the country.
But where does he come from?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which leads to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital insists that the State should not be involved in the economy by administering actions.
The question is further to be answered whether private capital, now practically governing policies and the same state, is in place for its own selfish purposes?
The only answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and vast lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have an unprecedented situation in corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In FRG, the situation is that, due to the lack of financial resources, public ministries have been entrusted with the development of legislation to private legal firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills were then approved by the Bundestag.
The whole authority is not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial and power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is evident that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly in a situation as described by Appian in the book "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The State has long broken down, and the institutions are engaged in violence.
Absence, illegality of mercy by means of stones and swords.
The coronation and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to elections with an earlier vote"...the successive people didn't fight at all for the position of governor, at the end of one time for eight months the State was left without consular."......"Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the self-government and the need to choose an energetic man."...Appian thought it would be Pompey, but he became Caesar, who eventually changed democracy into a self-government.
As in ancient times, today’s society is dominated by its own unreasonable interests without taking social interests into account.
Private capital is no longer, in fact, intended for public use.
The current result is not different from the past: the inappropriate fall of the elite without any effort to carry out more profound reforms.
That is why we must seek to liberalize the economic systems for the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break, followed by the next tour.
Above all, it is tragic that the current elite is completely ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the Law on Public Works is not a decision or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social population.
This trend is therefore a systemic trend.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the administration of the State, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and never can come out" is Sting, the song "Chrunky," where the main text is the words "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be" is the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meera Amschel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, caused many reactions.
Some speak for Israel, arguing its position that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, arguing that the Israeli State is racist, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who were born in these periodically repeated waves of murders as a criminal and whose victims, at the end of the day, were Israeli citizens, including self-managed territories, at the moment of the current political situation, and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to see who has been serving above all for the past 95 years of tension (regarding the signing of the Balfort Declaration in November 1917) in the small part of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
Human history is primarily a history of fighting for power.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What's not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps on their own, or have someone behind them who has guided their actions to the pre-destined goals.
It should be admitted that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and power from them could not have occurred for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one who could be considered the head of the spleen (I don't know if anyone is standing over them, but it's not being excluded) - Rotschild.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The First News Agency (Reuters) had already purchased in the 1990s in order to stop hearings that linked their names to criminal acts in the highest areas in which they were in the shadows, which always led to their strengthening of power, the increase of wealth or at the same time and to others.
They have large packages of action in almost all central banks of the world and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the arrival of Kadafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rotschild Bank of America, during the civil war he began to issue his own (governmental) money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), he was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to trial the FED for the release of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a three-world war plan created by the 33rd level mason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy the monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to bring down the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be sufficient to ensure their comfort and prosperity, and they will not need many resources), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and to the ultimate seizure of absolute authority.
The method used by the group of the richest families in the head with the Rotschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unravel World War I through the killing of the Habsburg heir of the Austrian-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, beginning the multi-wisdom revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, unwarranted in the military and economic sense of the capitalization of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy the royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria, had been decommissioned.
To facilitate the release of World War II, bankers and politicians have created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military repairs on Germany, which have created a precondition for the radicalization of the depleted masses, then only the Germans have been left to lay down a strong enough, responsible and proposing simple solution to the leader, to further establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and have actually played the fifth column in the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothsilda was provoked by a Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historical Judah and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balforra declaration provided a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had escaped from the chains where he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he had done had been planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created preconditions for the recognition of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany, was prompted by military repairs to the 2nd World War, the State of Israel was declared to form a haven of war.
If the international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will be victims of war on the front, now together with the Arab or, simply speaking, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of disunity and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (to take only sharp separation of people from Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the persecution causes an infinity of violence if it all begins with the desire of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers are encouraging people to vote in elections solely by their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister of the island of Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician who is doing all he can to start war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to turn into a global conflict, and taking into account Iran's control over the Ormuz River, which contains 20 per cent of all world oil stocks (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockfeller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serve as the backbone of financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
A world where each birth-born organism is implanted with a chip with which it becomes an essential under total control.
"And orders all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave, to have on their right hand or on their foreheads so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of its names may not even buy.
Here is wisdom. Whoever has reason can calculate the number of animals.
Because it corresponds to the human name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
The Argo Operation: When it's getting worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demonstrator students seized the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats into hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the decapitated Shah of Mohammed Reza Pehlev, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been the covert of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not see a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw chess on board because it could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations with the Government of Algeria.
Their destiny caused them to be at home concerned with solidarity and anti -original attitudes.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections that ended in the election of Ronald Reagan.
A film directed by actor Ben Afflek "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought small victories to America.
Not long before the embassy was occupied, six workers were able to escape.
After a difficult time, they completed their journey to the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, and helped by an extravagant cover legend, according to which they went on Canadian passports as members of the so-called So-called group who sought a place in the country for the collection of a science-fiction era.
Combined Genres
The plan by Tony Mendes, an expert on evacuation, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
For legend to be credible, the specialized journals wrote about the film project, set up press conferences, which the manufacturing company invented had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept in secret for a long time, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Film Afflek is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, called the film cinema, is the story of a successful party, an affair, for example, can be a number of films about Oushen's friends.
The film is constantly changing - on the one hand, the documentaryly thought-out scenes from Tehran (the headlines show signs of historical events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are many differences in this).
On the other hand, the Hollywood outbreaks of ironic and moderate exacerbation have been facilitated.
And then there's more scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in costumes are discussing the situation at the negotiating table, on the benches of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflek has been able to do a great career restaurant.
The actor was a respected director and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
Operation Argo is his third full-meter film, following the dark detective "Forgive, Child, Forgive" (2007) and the city troller (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Aflek, which is not recorded in the native city of Director Boston.
The feeling of the local atmosphere is related to the qualities that have elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Afleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The better scenes in the film take place on the streets, when real events are being rebuilt, the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history suddenly changes.
The same effect is achieved by Aflek and his colleagues on the stage of the inventions (separate headquarters at the Tehran Base).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had had to deal with the fact that the coating did not imply a large number of captivating scenes of cinematographic importance.
He's pretty successful with this little thing, sometimes something he's thinking about -- it's not that elegant.
The lack of Argo is the dissatisfaction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are indeed very promising, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
The Afflek film is not enough dramatism, it is a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, evaluating the setting and retro-style that re-establishs the seventies.
But it takes a lot of effort.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still known in the sense of living history, as well as to give evidence of an exaggerated view of all-powerful and all-knowing specialized services.
Air Layers, Bananas and Circles
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, conducting an annual survey of the most absurd banking collections, has now decided to announce a competition for "the absurd order itself or a project from the Master's EU".
"We have been moved by this latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said researcher Patrick Nager.
Among those already called absurdities, the European Court of Justice ' s recent decision to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
To date, women have had life assurance benefits because they are at a lower risk for insurance companies.
"The next incredible ideas from the Master's EU people can compete by the end of this year.
The vote alone will take place by the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The contested EU orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, resulting in damage to nature and the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances or a smoking cell directive, which has resulted in a significant increase in eggs this year.
The criticism was also subject to a factual ban on the use of the term “butterbrown oil” or the exemption from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The Common European Apparatus often decides under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose positions are usually protected by a State or a group of States in Brussels (this is why the Czech Republic is now even under the threat of a commitment to its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, high-quality bananas in the Euro Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and should not have been "anomalous".
However, the European Commission was justified by only harmonizing existing divergent national rules that made trade more difficult.
Despite the resistance of some States, the EU has nevertheless weakened fruit and vegetable standards, recalling that the existing directives will lead to product distribution.
The candidate for victory in the poll may also be a more recent EU decision that sales air carriers must be obliged to provide a warning that children under eight years of age may not attack them without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to American research that the aircraft at play is a potential cause of the death of children by means of a suffocation.
Such a restriction is now applicable to children under 14 years of age who are not allowed to sneeze in year-olds.
Fun ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials is absurd enough: everyone in the EU who has an official position cannot use the name of Macedonia, taking into account the delicateness of the topic for Greece, but should instead speak as "BURM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com Portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Fair, has proposed a vote, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the Euro Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the quantity of preserved mushrooms, which was threatened by a large fine.
The questionnaire organizers also had an interest in paying some countries for lack of sea and the idea of granting grants for a grant application.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We will ask for compensation from the European Union," said Mr. Jaroslav Palas, then Minister of Agriculture, in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he indicated that there was a high crop of grain in the country and that the so-called intervention buying-ins resulted in full stockpiles that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met with the Czech Republic and organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that did not have access to the sea.
The grants for the grant were proposed by the Ministry of Regional Development, managed by Minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such grants had to be made for applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Amazing orders are an exception
While Member States' decisions are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as more effective functioning and development of the Euro-Union, are, in the view of many experts, worth more recognition.
The experts believe that drawing EU grants for projects that are not even intended to have something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget, is a serious problem.
Emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, have retained the name "Olomukian Orchids", however, "Tuzemsk Rom", whose traditions are rooted in our country in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Tuzemak".
Only products can be called roms from tristolic distillate, not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world-renowned fat and gorgonzola, marzipan from the German Lubek or Parma vegetables, have already been found, for example, carnival dryers, pegelic and pelagic rocks and hazelnuts.
The EU's trade mark can also be proud of the perdubic spring and the gorilla tubes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a lover, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head to fight for the president's office?
I'm not thinking of becoming a senator or president.
If we had it all worked out in the country, I wouldn't fight anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been detonating over the last 20 years, how the gates are tied up, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been 40 years old, and I'm an independent man who's not a party, I have no other way to influence things than to fight for the position of senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Will you not then turn your backs on the people who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I'd be fighting in the presidents.
My goal is not a post, it is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we're a nation of slaves in our bar or TV, but that's what we're willing to do to anyone who's trying to change.
In addition, there are media that mislead people and mislead freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving a reception to journalists, or that I was a adviser to Irje Paroubek.
Let's go to your views.
You have begun the fight for the presidential castle with claims of the material and criminal liability of politicians and of the return of property declarations of more than twenty million.
To accomplish this, the law needs to be amended.
You have no such authority as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed to make the excursions a free business, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer to the left or the right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this hinders citizens.
As an independent independent party, I have far greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party layout, without regard for the dogmas, I can take what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you think you're a person more concerned with the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left-hand man.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not that someone is on the right and someone on the left. I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it will be proposed by the CCCM or the GDPR, and I will be against the bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're popular.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
It can be called populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will be left with nothing but gossip.
And you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out your criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to turn them on their side so that we can achieve our own.
If I had been elected president, it would not have been a problem to organize a direct television broadcast, in which I would appeal to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legalize the material and criminal liability of politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there is a strong personality that causes abuse, pressure on the political scene can be exerted.
Take the President's direct election -- it was a public pressure.
I'm just saying that I'm a lover, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am only a political beginner, and for my programme I am trying to get the support of the majority.
I try to move on my own; in case this fails, I will end up in six years and return to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything, so I went through some famous people with a proposal to fight in the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, and he gave up a lot of work.
I also at least supported the ongoing investigation by journalist Jan Lawrence, who exposed fraud with light fuel oil products.
I have won my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel weighed.
Sixty per cent of the people were not elected, but most of those who were elected to represent the institution.
Only two of us are independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will take place with difficulty.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the reason for your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account, only $20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property statements, and how are your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of art productions of about 10 million, Aston Martin by 3.5 million, and Schkoda Superb by a million, and a few more million on account.
By the way, aston Martin showed up to me because it was my little dream -- I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was brave with women, and at the same time fought against dishonesty and lawlessness.
You're traveling to Aston Martin, you own 60 million property, and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You're saying you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors proves that my program isn't so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-election campaign out of my closet.
The costs of my campaign will actually cover the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be fighting anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut it?
But it doesn't depend on the amount of pay.
As I promised, I partially reduced my business.
For example, the director of the tourist agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be an unscrupulous man who will keep the republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How much, like an entrepreneur, have you gotten used to getting every month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that's what I get.
And if I were a president, I'd finish my business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's issue of "Right."
Architects of MVRDV prove that these adventures are not only imagined - for example, Spekenis and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in the vicinity of the big company, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I wonder, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
No one's volunteering in these old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spekenis, a small sleepy town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this annoying situation a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven well-designed bridges on euro banknotes, in the form of illustrated iron-betained miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city’s fathers realized that they had the only chance to resist statistics — to build a library here!
The wines Maas from the Rotterdam architectural office of MVRDV, the master of bold column diagrams and the author of strong, sometimes even cynical buildings, were concerned with the task of their usual impertinence and appeared at a competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the muscle and facial embezzlement.
And while members of the jury were looking over and grinning their shoulders, the tough Maas put out his original pyramid gift and ended up defending his project by saying, "Dear citizens!"
That's what I'm suggesting: "The Book Mountain" in Spykenniss, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain was worth 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes a underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent homes and taunhouses of a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was marked by the second award of the 2012 Great Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Timber Competition.
Thus, the unparalleled garden, which had previously been unable to offer anything but the post-modernist pedestrian zone and an amazingly unpredictable rattan whose white facades are thought of as a milk factory, has become richer than one modern architecture.
But the main thing is that in Spain the first public cultural destination building appeared in the history of this town.
A Long Way to a Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cup for cheese.
There is only one lift located in the center of the mountain mass, because the present worshipers of architecture and reading prefer to study this location by foot.
A bright and easy-to-see room with all sides, the fields of adorable bricks and elegant street lights are undoubtedly creating a sense of public urban space.
The city environment is perfectly restored.
It's not easy to look for girls, boys, dogs and football players.
And everywhere -- books, books, books.
“The bookshops usually stand next to the facades, and there is a large dark hall in the middle, usually impenetrable and impenetrable,” says Vinny Maas.
We put a classic configuration of the space from the foot to the head and pulled out the area for reading from the outside.
The inner space of the book mountain is well used: offices, Internet libraries, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are available at the centre.
In particular, the black book population who serve as the wall section, the parapets, and the walk - through beads are particularly happy.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and engineers are lost in speculation, which is an unknown material.
"We tried to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, project manager representing the community of Speikenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a farm in Frisland, we met the right side product of agriculture.
For many years in the warmer and fields in the Netherlands, the artificial fibre material of a millimeter thickness has been used as a base under the roots.
It's cheap and saves time.
A thin textile serves one or two seasons, then it can be removed.
For the library, this canvas, for the first time in such volumes, was pressed into a four - inch - thick panel.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbausplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, uniform, durable material, with the smell of a little reminder of a new car and a little cross.
There's 105 degrees to the top.
Anyone who crosses the road nearly 500 metres long will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquets and wooden figurines in the woods.
They take care of the atmosphere and, above all, of the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs for a new person
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is an ecological model project," Trouborst says.
The heat of the earth is used to warm and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cupboard, even in the clear days the sun only falls within for a short time.
Large wooden farms that are perpendicular to a glass facade provide shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is fully automatic roller bearings.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verhaig was here too.
And Cynthia Bogard, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, called Bukenberg "the soul of Spakeniss, which has long been missing".
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each person received an invitation to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books were to be occupied with empty spaces in the shelf of a library not yet fully filled - at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The poles are placed at the top.
"There's nothing worse than a half-distant library," says architect Vinny Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, everyone now has some connection to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she serves only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV was able to solve the royal task, which is called the creation of identity in the professional garage.
Spekenis wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first realized that it was voting against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, while not speaking too critical of Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a restricted area for flights.
NATO has finally put forward this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The issue is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, from a policy that has been managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent common policy for Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again placed between the two fronts.
They were expected to play a more independent role, but they did not get used to it.
I believe that as long as they're just playing their part, they're on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such an external policy carried out by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position for its own national interests, not dependent on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. on exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ considerably from those of other major States, and Germany should therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf States.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give this too much importance, it's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, this plays an important role in German calculations.
Did Germany harm its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, an understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as it was in the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will gain some respect in this way.
This indicates that it should be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States had made a clear statement about the veto.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a deep understanding of the European position.
But in the context of the local political situation, of course, the Government cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences in opinion are not as important as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, note that Obama is not in any way out of line with Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the situation of an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a little bit easier if there were a united, unopposed European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, based only on their own vision of the situation.
That's how they deal with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will play a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is understandable that it is not easy for Germany, even if it is linked to Israel.
This subject has always been sensitive.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won't it really take on the leading role?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany plays an important role, the most diverse anti-German feelings are expressed.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
Of course, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account the different neighbours and opinions, and this was not easy.
Thus, the U.S. influence in European policy is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
Even if you do not like it, it is an unpleasant thing to do, or it is an abomination to you.

"Protection of trade marks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a fully officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is established.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have filed a complaint.
But it is not clear whether they will be able to stand up for their rights.
“Foreigners are becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of the rights to trademarks in the Far East.
There's a new case on my desk every week.
To the simulators, add a few letters to get the right to register their trade marks.
This is how Lu-Gucci comes from Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied.
The Pattloch opens a folder with records of the registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zigen DF Puma trade mark, which also used the name of the modern house Ermenegildo Zigen.
The fact that the Chinese are champions of the world to copy and violate intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are multi-purpose universities that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloh's case is not the case; on the orders of his creditors, he advocates that Chinese companies should receive the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else from the registration of trademarks.
The Chinese call it "ban minipai", the passenger brand.
This word is associated with the Dokuan Ban.
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not acknowledge their guilt
"It harms business, it must be fought," Pattloch is convinced.
"The trade mark fades, the unique situation fades, the image suffers very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, it is difficult to remove questionable entries in the trade mark register, and it is worth it.
The process may take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch relates the cases in which the court dismissed the claim, since the long term of the contested term became “the reality of the market”.
If the plaintiff does not succeed, he will even have to pay the plagiarism because he has damaged his trade mark in China, Pattloh says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also well-known cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler was involved in a court dispute with the manufacturer of Sany’s construction machines, a company that had recently acquired a Putzmeister concrete plant.
So the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem that looks like a Mercedes star.
The buying Volvo Geely initially used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products Lacoste lost the copyrs from Hong Kong and Singapore in China, where the famous crocodile looked on the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The notice of registration of the trademarks of CTMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to the lack of personnel and equipment in the premises.
But last year, there was a "return from the emergency situation in the working process to the norm".
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases has decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
At least 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting this road is worth it
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trade marks were reported in CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China, for the tenth time in a row, has led the list of new registrations around the world, the department reports.
The same applies to the total number of valid trade marks, totaling 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan fees were paid.
To simplify this means that each registration is worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euro.
It is worth a lot more to protest, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans were able to find that their illicit production of fake car details had been eliminated.
However, the simulator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trade mark.
This was its own omission, as the German surnames were not protected, says Hanno Ventcler, President of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO registration agency rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg has won in both of the following instances, but the opposing side continues to fight so far.
There must be a beginning.
The question is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventcler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves."
Internal costs could hardly be taken into account, the company's archives had to be reviewed even centuries ago to produce evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully proposed to the opposing side "a larger six-digit euro" for a settlement.
"From here it's clear how much it costs us," says Ventcler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to travel even to Europe.
This is the case where the simulators record unprotected trade marks.
Thus, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for leather shoes and articles.
The Group had long ceased its production in these areas, but could still prevent registration.
"We need to be careful," says Ventcler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trade marks, and it is more likely that foreigners should “all that needs to be protected, also registered in China”, says Ventcler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trade mark drama, he will have to pay the opposite party licence fees for his own name, explains Ventcler.
Otherwise, we'll be forced out of the market in a dispute segment.
World AIDS Day: Diving, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi is repeated, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted to do so.
A history of relationships that lasted more than 8733 kilometres.
At first, diving takes place: cowboy turtles, basketball crossbows, ladies' boats and men's balls pick up a tat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that do the voices of the singers grow slowly — alth, bass, tenor, and soprano — they come up, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old director, doesn't jump out of his motherly shoes when he drives them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, a new song is repeated in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberge chor Imbongi.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from human genetic experts to courtrooms.
"Om'Obani" is a simple thing, every voice of people has their own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to the United Nations AIDS Programmes, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 per cent of the population are HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitheni, the Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school prepared for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the lead.
It guarantees the child money for school, school form and daily hot lunch at the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in Zulu means a storyteller or an admirer.
There's no running around in this room because they can sing.
For almost ten years, choirs have been studying songs in this foreign soft language, and from time to time, they have even been brought back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
Because 8733 kilometers from Heidelberg, north-west of Swaziland, is the village of Estitheni, which depends on the voices of German people.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people, some still living in simple clay and salmon huts, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were missing parents who died of HI.
In Estigena, the disease is reflected in the whole of Swaziland: the highest HIV level, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The cutting of the extremities in men, which are proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, has almost not been adopted among the population.
More than forty per cent of the population of Swaziland have an immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not rare.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but Imbogna had seen many children on the streets not only of parental care but also of food, clothing, education.
Without school education, people in the poor country have no chance at all.
At first, this was a private obligation of individual participants - for several euros a year to send the child to school and allow him once a day to receive hot food.
But a year later, the group "Voices for Africa" was founded, which since then has almost been professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Estitheni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial IPPs include syphilis, chlamydiasis and tripper (gonoreus).
HIV, human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viral IPRs.
Pedicula and frequency are included in the parasitic IPPP.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koha Institute assumes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are the result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often have sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia, trichomonosis, candidiasis, gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new HIV infections belong to this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infections are much more frequent than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How are the number of cases of infection changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to Robert Koha Institute, has more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than last year.
What symptoms suggest a venereal disease?
In infectious diseases there may be convulsions in genitalia, wetting, separation, lowering pain, or blistering.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Preservatives are able to reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100% protection.
For, in part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and with close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular surveys, especially when sexual partners are often replaced.
Early diagnosis can cure the majority of IPRs and avoid distant effects.
Chiefs, donations and not ultimately fees for people's presentations throughout Germany allow something to be collected.
"We've already sent everything to Essitheni about 200,000 euros," said Annette Lennartz, president of the Association.
In the village itself, Dlamina, a conscious and active woman, has money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well-equipped, for example in one of the grandparents.
Gogos, as they call Zulu's old women, is the village's fortress.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and took care of their children in their daily form at school.
Those who are not yet born enter the home of Hanisil, a single woman who is paid for by the union, as well as two bribes that each day prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the Voices for Africa Association organized a Swiss school, built two smokers and, together with the American Health Organization, organized an analysis of HIV for many rural people.
It's hard to imagine, but the disease that is so obvious throughout the country prefers to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mwati III, is known for his love of remains.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-approved lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HI virus in recent years.
But it's also on shipworkers who blow up the country's virus.
Free condoms are literally on each corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are almost out of use.
Another culture is sex."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, Ibmogni mountains every two or three years travel to South Africa and sing songs, complete boars, war spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which many in the southern end of the Black Continent have known since the apartheid.
The bus, full of whites who sing songs in black, not only gives a good mood and joy but has even caused tears in the eyes of harsh frontiers.
The trip is also always carried to Essithen, where singers visit underprivileged children.
Although it is hard to find a small village on a map, it is well - known in the Eculveni Valley.
"Go to Essitheny, there's a world," people here say.
And after 8733 kilometers of flight back to Heidelberg, when the deafening singers return to the Reception Hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
Messenger: NASA opens the ice in Mercury
Zond "Messenger" has found evidence that there is ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Agency has proved the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although it is located near the Sun, there is also frozen water, as shown in the three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
Zond "Messenger" found evidence that the ever-dark region of the planet would be covered by ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters.
Apparently, the water comes from comets or perhaps the asteroids that hit Mercury.
Nobody connects the opening of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said scientific leader of the mind of Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these openings could help explain how the water and other building elements of life had gone into other locations of the solar system.
For the inhabitants of the Earth, the senses, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, study the depths of the Universe.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: small eyes in endless spaces.
The picture comes from the cameras developed by the German researchers from the Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system as well as the Carlic Planet of Cerer.
Like Pluto, which is around the Sun for Neptune, Cerera, after a new definition of the international astronomical union since 2006, is not “planned”.
This fragment of the infrared telescope "Spitzer" represents the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots, the harder to identify the pink "born" stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation -- scientists call it W5 unromantically -- is an open telescope "Spitzer" in the Cassiopea constellation, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dead-star flutter photographed NASA's Spitzer telescope.
It looks like a ring is made up of a material that the star has released in the process of dying.
In the giant storm of the Trifid, which was removed for 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars emerge from the gas and dust.
NASA Telescope "Spitzer" took this photo of the Galactic Homeland.
The constellation Pleiade, also called "Seven Sisters", can be seen by an unarmed eye at night.
Of course, color telescopes do better.
As a red eye, the observatorial fog of Ulitak in this infrared image.
It is located at the distance of 700 light-years in the constellations of Vodolei.
The similarity to the Earth continent has brought this fog to the name "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive coloring.
This new star was able to be photographed in all its beauty only by infrared sensors called Spitzer.
Saturn and his ring: How did they come up is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe it's the number of Saturn's moons that disappeared four and a half billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest photos of the Hubble telescope: the Waterworth galaxy
Depending on the coloring of the pictures of spiral galaxies, they become the present art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows Trifid's fog in the constellation of the Shooter for thousands of light years.
The name Trifrid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-dimensional, three-dimensional), since dark strips of dust are divided into three parts of the broken heart of the star.
Astronomers photographed space collisions in the constellation: 400 million light-years away from the Earth are the cores of two interspersing galaxies that are facing each other and are unavoidably collisioned.
This was the birth of the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy of M83.
A person who doesn't like technical reductions can call it "The South Pipe Colossus."
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows the fog fragment of Iris in the star Cefey.
The darkness, which has been removed for 1,400 light years, consists of particles of dust, ranging from 10 to 100 times that of ordinary domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and x-rays of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, which is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
A larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cobblestone is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, coupled with the fog of Rosetka, is also constantly creating new stars at the distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright, bright galaxy with a small black thread, there's no drinking yet, just gas.
Researchers estimate that it occurred shortly before the Great Explosion when the Universe was essentially hydrogen.
Our Views in the Universe: Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem before Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescopes have become more and more visible to space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Big Binocular Telescope was installed.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each diameter 8.4 meters.
Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of only one mirror is 10.4 meters.
The Great South African Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce its value.
However, in diameter it reaches about 11 meters.
Lack of low-value constructive performance: the telescope is firmly anchored under a vertical angle, which limits its movement.
The Hobby-Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality is a high light-collection capacity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to alien signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the "Finding for Foreign Sense" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
Type of European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in Chilean Andean.
There's "The Great Telescope" here, which is entirely in line with its name.
Its four mirrors allow to illuminate even the average infrared spectrum in the visible tube.
The Chilean ESO Observatory also plans to install a European Large Telescope.
Its main mirror must be placed at a total of 42 metres and will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photographs should be expected not earlier than 2018.
By 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which is also seen in the sky with the help of Superaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, there must be a new giant telescope in Mauna Kea with a mirror of 30 metres.
They can love illustrations here.
However, the most important species in space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has provided pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The photos include the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webba Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space not earlier than 2018 on board the Arian 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the Great Explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists assume that there is ice on the south shelf of Mercury.
There is, however, no reliable data on this, since the Messenger is heading closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radiation measurements over the decades indicated that there was ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the "Messenger" sense launched in 2004, the first to go around Mercuria, scientists are now convinced of it.
Drink butter every day - and live for 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Bible age.
There's even a museum here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a more Bible age.
There's even a museum here.
Looking for a reflection in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
A trip through the Tales Mountains can be called a wild and romantic.
A minibus with a thunderstorm runs along the narrow road beyond the dense woods of hills, stormy peaks, and simple Christian homes.
Everything around you is so green and bright that you can imagine yourself in Schwarzwald.
But it's the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is just a few miles from here.
The Talais live here, one of the Caucasian peoples, who know little about it, are they only speaking beautifully in Persian and Azerbaijani and are different in their longevity.
The final item is Leric.
The small town is built by too heavy a Soviet architecture, which is totally incompatible with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring.
There's eight hours to go for 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea is here in the province until it has reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in in Leric.
"In May Baku celebrated the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the world's older people," Fatulaeva says.
She's the director of a museum of ages, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biographical documented here about eight dozen of these places that are over 100 years old.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star museum is the Shirali Muslim chaban, which was claimed to be 168 years old.
The birth certificate, however, is not.
In view of the fact that the older person, whose age was confirmed by documents, was 122 years old, the age of Muslim seems to be extremely questionable.
"He was born in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he probably had a daughter.
Did he add a pair of decades to his age?
Because even Rembrandt Scholtz, a senior researcher at the Max Plank Institute in Rostok, heard about the debtors in Central Asia.
"It is impossible to meet many of the elderly in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely very old people in Sardinia."
However, because of the lack of documents, it was impossible to confirm age because there were no civil records.
Every day a bottle of hot oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Léric often get to the age of the Bible.
Now 20 people live here over 100 years of age.
Why here, in the south, so many debtors?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this by the special genes of the whale.
The director of Fatulaeva's museum, on the contrary, believes that the matter is about nutrition.
Tales like meat, bread, and most dairy products, many of them drink on a hot oil bottle every day, but if such a high-calorie diet can hardly be healthy from a dietary point of view.
In Chengemeer, a small village not far from the city of Leric, Rubab Mirzoev lives.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young to this extent.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a little bit of oil that she's never been able to get around here.
Eight men live under one roof, including one of the sons and the daughter of Mirzaev, who have their grandchildren for a long time.
There are also two little ones in the vicinity.
In the kitchen, guests prepare tea, which they place in typical crates.
Mirza's ideally flat and strong white teeth, under the main plate it's a rather long dark-skinned hair, which her son proudly spreads before us.
I've always had my hair in milk, so they never looked out and kept a color.
"And I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She's always only eating what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots.
For the rest of my life, I never bought any products in the store.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it was better when the "loved father" Geidar Aliev got up.
Propaganda does not often sound like an old woman.
However, the cult established around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan virtually did not know the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, was adopted by the Board of Governors.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani elders.
Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount of euro) for local living conditions.
And perhaps the long-standing son of Mirza's rights: "Old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, cared for and happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is not found in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Contestant demonstrations in Cairo show a deep breakdown of the country.
The future Sharia-based constitution met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian President did not gather for the Paphos.
We have to make a move.
"And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but first of all to Christian graves, liberals, educated Muslims and non - religious Egyptians.
They are all fearful of the day when they will be thrown into a state of confusion.
Fear of the religious State in the Nile for the mercy of the powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohammed Murcy, if you don't apologize, said that he temporarily cut the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his jurisdiction, "to save the revolution."
However, the fact is that the 61-year-old engineer who is a doctor at the University of South California in the United States does not really want to save the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be powerless?
In fact, 234 articles were able to be spread in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles to the Islamic-oriented constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this was partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the caselaw is based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains the case for interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use the fluent language and the resulting legal air for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases relating to Sharia, al-Ashar University, the important Islamic institution of a country that enjoys great authority throughout Sunni Islam, should be drawn to the council.
This should not mean, but it could mean that the clergy were overseeing legislation that de facto would result in a limitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is subject to interpretation
Another problem: the conviction of civilians to the military court must remain.
These courts, during the time of Mubarak, served to suppress the opposition.
After the dictator was arrested, there were up to 11,000 civilians.
As stated in the project, the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morals and values”.
Legally, this is so vague that public institutions will be able to control even the content of films and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
At all, no article establishes direct equality between men and women.
Therefor the other forbiddeth that he should be offended, and that he should make a prophet and an apostle.
But what such an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable that the language is prohibited from “suffering people”.
Will it suffice to have cartoons on the president or jokes about the law?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, which Morsi proposed for signature and which he said would be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution Is Back"
The opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been formed for several weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in extraordinary loneliness on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbachi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
Laurent of the Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohammed El-Baradei stated that the draft Constitution was “a place of destruction of history”.
Through the short news service Twitter, he accused Morsi's commitments to lead the "road against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down," said opposition Yasser Said.
"We have not yet stopped, the blood of our brothers has not yet been recovered," the Egyptian media quoted Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brothers, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but with caution, not at Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the cover of the Salafites, who cried out: “The people require the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Mursi, "Clear the land," and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic place where it all began sparked the situation of practically civil war.
The Morsi followers obviously did not want to take that risk.
Muslim brothers said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide in the polling session in which direction the country should go.
Most of the Islamic project is considered to be a decisive case.
"The notion of "human rights" is never mentioned"
Hafiz Abu Saeda was angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have been extended until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) protected the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison at Mubaraka or presented to the court.
Not because he shared their views, but because human rights were indivisible to him.
That's why he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in his conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of the influence of Morsi on all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures constitute a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the President de facto canceled it," said Saeda.
For democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be why you're paying for it.
The protestor at Tahrir Square warns: "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norway’s Raffic — The Most Stupid Fish in the World?
The five million population of Norway is one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country's success is somehow related to local passion for an extremely evil fishing vessel?
Take a few clear pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and dusty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get the wrong smell of crabs -- one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful around the snow-covered species, but in the air, there's an inexhaustible smell.
Racfisk is a powder that is salty and boiled in the water before the year, depending on what a person needs to achieve.
As the Sumerians get together and cold, the Norwegian crowd gathers for the Fagernes festival, which is about itself, let's say, the captivating candle.
"It eats raw and drinks a room of water, a local dark vodka," explains Howard Halwarsen, a local fire department and a "racfisc general" who runs the festival.
People around us eat small cubes of fish and drink them with small portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquariums more than a crab," says Howard.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad - it's a little different from the dry portion that you've been on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, a time of poverty when, before the colder temperatures, fish were stuck in hermetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then it was a deep winter when the fish were already well and well stocked, pulled out, and swallowed up by alcohol and used in food.
In memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to migrate mainly to the United States.
The population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of immigrants being brought to work, high wages and an advanced social security system.
The people of Sweden (the former rival, not so long ago and much more livelyly) come to work here.
Racfisk is seen as some important symbol, a constant, though a few cruel elements of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, there will be 9 pounds (U.S.) of sterling ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and the majority of the country ' s inhabitants seem to have it.
People here have so far been reluctant to mention the name Anders Brawiek, racist and extremist right-wing, last year of 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, the attack is called "the 22nd of July".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that one of their fellow citizens has proved capable of such atrocities and killings in their country of peace.
Norway's current prosperity is based on the growth (from the beginning of the 1970s) of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"The same oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our officer, who has a long-lasting case of raffia, a woman with long hair and a striking blue eye, embellishment of Nordic well-being.
We are a people of understanding, as you call them.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English beautifully.
We don't like showing up, we're not proud.
Norway is very cautious about its oil - most of its oil revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they did not have was counted carefully by Norway.
"As long as you can climb on the snowflakes and walk in the spring, that's enough for happiness," Anna says.
"And there's a raffic," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow for some food.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat. It's just exotic. It's delicious juice.
But we're still looking forward to more and more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special meal on the shelf, during which guests vote to determine the best or perhaps the most aromatic fish.
There's a direct TV showing the lead in the popcorn, surrounded by raffis.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"Well, Tor-Jorgen, what was your estimate of the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our evaluation."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe taking over the aquarium.
Or maybe just inhaling the smell of this fish.
Mexico's president, Enrique Penenya Neeto, is facing a difficult start to her career.
While the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Penya Njeto, prepares to enter the post, the correspondent, BBC Will Grant, invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's people.
Road traffic in Mexico now is particularly crying.
The city was overloaded with transport and at best, and from Monday there were steel fences that cut several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this has not been done so as not to allow people to get to work from the suburbs, but rather to prevent protesters from falling into Parliament ' s building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Penya Njeto will give a presidential conveyance and accept the country's rule.
He's faced with a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators in the administration of Felipe Kalderon, who is now in power, but the country has been embroiled in the war on drugs, which has already brought about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government is telling the people of Mexico that it is ready to fight violence," Mr. Penya Nyet told President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements with the President of the United States, the political career of Mr. Penjena Njeto developed as governor of his home country, Mexico.
In his family, in a densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital of the country, the views of the new leader were divided.
Primoline person
In the idyllic town of Vale-de-Bravo, for example, they remember it with warmth.
The residents deserve the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort and the creation of infrastructure.
You can get to the city on one of the new roads built by Mr. Penjena Njeto, which are quite different from the roads with excavators and pits that were in the area before.
The tables with its name depend on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We link hope to real and serious changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Ernandes, State Congressman of the Head of the Njeto Institutional and Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the current and decisive changes that our country is so urgently needed, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay with the PRI party, Visente Fox was expelled in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence in the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes in Enrique Penjena Njeto.
He also rejected the insanity charges that had led to the opposition of the new President.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the question of the appearance of his vision of the future country.
He is an outstanding State perpetrator, and above all, a man who is capable of listening.
But in the other part of the state, many people had another idea about the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkootl, also known as Ciudad Ness, is the most fragmented contrast with the mighty streets of Vale de Bravo.
Hidden under the highways of the highways, he is, in many ways, the suburbs of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipalities are also severe in nature.
Earlier this year, troops had been drawn to calm the drug-trafficking gangs in these areas, and violence against women was particularly severe.
A few dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near the extensive wasteland for the last two years.
More than a thousand women have been killed in Mexico during the reign of Mr. Penjena Njeto - this is much more than that in the tragic violence of the city of Sudad Huarez, whose name has become similar when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to opponents, Mr. Penjena Njeto was best known for his failure to deal with the issue of the murder of women while he was serving as governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A concrete house dwelling, like most houses in this covered area, Irina Bundia is hard to hold back tears, showing me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family felt that her companion had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it was like her body was washed before," recalls Mrs. Bundy.
There were signs of her being killed, and the body was already surrounded.
Mariana’s mother is telling this story, and her daughter’s portrait is looking at us from the wall where he hangs up next to the curtain on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That is what they say was rejected by this family.
"The officials of the state treated me like an old coven, an unsatisfactory offender.
They want people to just believe everything they say and shrink.
But it's wrong, it can't be, especially when there's so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
With the President's transfer on Saturday, President Penya Njeto will take on an easy responsibility with her.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by crimes of violence, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor," said Olvera, a congressman from Vale de Bravo from PRI.
However, that is what the victims ' families in the City of Ness fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about any ill-treatment, the prosecution said.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, attention was paid to Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the terms of Manning ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that the Order of Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified materials in U.S. history, had not taken advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said had to be transferred to a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort-Midde, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that the weekly visits by the Manninga prison administration for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-examined inquiry into the application for protection against Manning ' s case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in itself sufficient punishment was carried out the following day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
The military intelligence expert, arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the web site WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was a source of information.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fain and Manning reviewed the reports that were filled after Manning's visits to the administration during his stay in Quantico Prison, where he was under a strict prison regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials questioned and recorded Manning.
When Prosecutor Fine asked Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that he considered the treatment of himself by the prison administration as “superordinary” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manninga has been directly asked about its contents, Faine claims.
Manning replied that he had voiced concern about these problems and that his representatives of the administration had discussed these issues with him and said that they would, but had not fixed it in writing.
"They were writing "no problems" (after my complaints were discussed), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this topic in conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Deniz Linde, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his wrongful treatment in January 2011 at the meeting of the Commission on Suicide, which he had written a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get rid of the “trafficking” regime and mitigated the conditions of detention.
Military officials explained that the restricted detention regime - at a lower level than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide - had been introduced to protect the detainee as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that it was all right with me to cancel the trauma prevention regime... to improve the standard of my life from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to a military-martial prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that he had lost consciousness once because of a strong burn.
He explained that psychologically difficult when you are not told how you are involved and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world went down to Camp-Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in this cell."
In Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small room at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day in complete isolation.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattress, clothing, sneakers, some clothes and glasses.
He says he was trying to move, because sleeping or even lying on a day - to - day basis was forbidden.
According to Manning, while he was asleep, he was constantly seeing a light that penetrated the outside of the camera.
If the guards didn't see his face when he was turning into bed at night, they said he was woken up and forced him to turn back.
Lawyer Manning made an official objection to Manning ' s unlawful treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during Thursday ' s testimony that after one night he was forced to sleep in his room in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at the morning check.
Manning said he could not hide his clothes during the check.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw away the clothes he could cover, but admitted that no one had direct orders him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said that he was forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use a shirt of rabbits or rabbits to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his lower white, helms and glasses were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had had to survive during his detention and would significantly reduce his sentence if Manning was found guilty by the military court, which should begin his case at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to suggest that Manning should be guilty of less serious crimes and that other charges should be disputed as excessive.
The reopening of hearings is planned for these outputs, and it is expected that the accused party will insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of prisoners under the strictest regime.
Among the charges brought by Manningu are the assistance of the opponent, the illicit promotion of Internet access, the transfer of national defence information, and the abduction of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may be at risk of life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of their lack of opportunity to realize themselves.
Mexicans are willing to blame those who have left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking up between two cultures.
During my recent visit to Mexico, I went through the hall for the arrivals, got close to the border control area, and stopped at the site.
The signs were two lines: one for Mexicans (Mexicons), the other for Foreigners (foreigners).
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and friends from New York call themselves Italians.
Later, I came across the complex design of "American of Mexican origin".
But I was here in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became a partner for Extraranjos.
I recalled this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Penya Njeto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda was common to the meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Njeto was eager to talk about the rise in the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to stay in Mexico, with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wanted to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc like the Euro Union.
In addition, President Penya Njeto promised to continue the war against drug addicts in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a serious and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans had never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders to give up half their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see memories of those events everywhere.
It is therefore only for any U.S. State to complain of criticism on the part of Mexico, in the press and in the elites of Mexican society, that there are complaints that Americans are concerned about the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of the Montesumas are refilled with military.
Mexico has the most complex relationship with over 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about the holidays?
Enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find themselves in that country and those who do not have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican descent only for one reason: at some point in their family history, no one - father or grandfather - was able to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most of them were Mexicans of a certain type, poorly educated, from poor Christian families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
They see it differently in Mexico.
Today our life is an inspiration of the American dream, we've learned in good schools and we've got good jobs, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country we consider to be.
United States of America.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer the same question.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they treat us as people of the second kind, as non-existent Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Only our existence is due to their failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not now be on the verge of a sexually transmitted disease by finding a life - threatening life in the United States but losing our spiritual relationship.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and was legally transferred to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain exercises between Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, Mexicans having a clearer understanding of their national identity and Americans of Mexican origin.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my well-known Americans of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigers del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstin.
Getting the best out of two worlds, you're losing your roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during my visit, as if our relations were not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican descent to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country this is and how much we could visit it and we could convince political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many trials in the past.
In view of the gap between the rich and the poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not see this country as beautiful.
I'm sorry, but understand that yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States how they dealt with Mexico half a century ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still offended by the recent dealings in Mexico with their relatives.
Yeah.
Please, we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Near East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas Group could become a fragile foundation for further peace
Is long-term peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The major round of bloodshed is pushing for the conclusion that such hopes are in vain.
There are ordinary, senseless disputes about who first began; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis, were killed; for the first time during the conflict, rockets released from the Gaza Strip fell into the vicinity of the capital city of Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelis and the Palestinians were hopelessly bound up in their eternal conflict, the Middle East has changed.
This may be different, but the events of the Arab Spring surrounded many of the enduring realities in the storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis were unable to stay away from the storm that shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their fight will be even more bloody than before.
There are reasons, however, to hope that this deadly scourge will come to an end.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, would be implemented, the clashes this week only strengthened the positions of the rapists on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, said that they had forced Israel to withdraw despite their losses.
Although some group leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people have been trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world grew, new influential and rich friends appeared at Hamas.
The rising regional leader of Turkey, who had once been Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
The trading supporters of Hamas declare the establishment of an Islamic semi-major Israel - from Lebanon to northern Lebanon, where the Hezbollah military group runs to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are undermining the authority of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's allies threaten Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened with President Muhammad Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was defeated in 2011, was a world dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas.
On the contrary, the Muslim brothers are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice could not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hotline in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was entrusted.
The Israeli missile system "The Iron Dome" justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of Hamas's launch missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanging position; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
Another important factor was Israel's economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Benjamin Netanyahou, who had largely ignored the peace process.
Although about 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by missiles released from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of terrorists, partly from a wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan, a large part of the unrecognised Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such acts from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, as part of its preparations for the 22 January elections, was combined with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Abigdor Liberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of developing and giving Palestinians their own State?
If they were to give them all the power in the West Bank territory, would they not start from there on the side of Israel, as their assemblies in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and press hard on any attempt to raise their heads.
It is possible that the supporters of the "hard" line will win; however, their calculations may be rejected in the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries experience not the warmest feelings of Israel, their domestic problems will become a priority.
Israel's defence budget is more than all its Arab neighbours, taken together.
The deployment of war against the regional superpowers would help Governments of the Arab countries to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Mursi, who worked with Barak Obama on the ceasefire, was a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change.
Israel must, to a minimum, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As a result of democratic change in Arab countries, the deprivation of the right of Palestinians to self-determination is a bomb of delayed action, which will explode early or late on Israeli-occupied territories, such as the Tel Aviv bus this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - is only exacerbating these problems.
The growing dissatisfaction of the international community is due to the bleeding operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas.
Both sides need external impulse
There remains the only solution to which health-care representatives from both sides are constantly urged, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two States and Israel ' s alienation of territories for security.
The hope, which is not too impressive in the short term, remains that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the sides of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which had long decided to end the arms supply in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, had, as never, a positive position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State, which had been adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fath movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than a future vote in the UN, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
President Obama should also play his role in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he did not present his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
After his return to the White House, he continued to demonstrate his refusal to engage in addressing the problem.
It's a catastrophicly invisible position.
The United States is committed to stability in the Middle East.
This can only be done in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia entered into force on a unified pack of cigarettes.
The warning against the harm of smoking and the images of the affected parts of the body are contrasted with those of the unscrupulous green cartons, which are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first Australian law on the uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force in the world, replacing the logo and colouring of different brands with the same colour as the olive-colored box with yellow images of the disease affected by the body parts and images of children whose health has been damaged by their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning of smoking injury, the only difference between the spots imposed on this Saturday is the name of the marks printed with the same small font.
These are the most harsh conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, avoiding this harmful habit of fashion.
Such a solution was based on studies that showed that non-smokers under the age of 26 never become smokers in 99 cases out of 100.
"It is obvious that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning of trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of packaging," explains Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the world's smallest countries of smokers, so these changes will not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences that are different from those that were designed by its initiators," says Scott McKinthair, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will place much more of such products for sale on Australia streets.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portigars and silicone soles covering unpleasant pictures in the package has grown rapidly (almost from zero) since two months ago, such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have been trying to appeal to the Australian High Court.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented about six thousand products for opt-out companies and is awaiting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential mix for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of the experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are addressed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws making illegal television advertising and supporting sports activities, as well as banning sellers from displaying cigarettes in a visible place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertising on the network, but it cannot restrict it to foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little lasagna left, the idea of moving your goods online will prove to be extremely tempting," explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews on trademarks written by alleged ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises is, is this really the case of a class citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't waste his time and make a video, or is the advertising company behind it?
The Australian Office of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States submit claims under the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been subject to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersec, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first compulsory photo placement that warned against smoking.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of law-enhancing is being considered in Britain, New Zealand, YAR and India.
The majority of smokers in Australia are not demonstrably responsible for innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You're just taking out a cigarette and you're driving a pack into a carnival," explains Victor El Haeg, who buys a cigarette with a picture of a mouthful of it.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco store in Sydney, claims that the same package has made it more difficult for people to place their products.
"I used to have an hour to unload the new party, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, then we'd say what to do, okay, it's over, we're closing the store," he says, putting his hands up.
It's not so bad to go online and get a permanent connection in the world.
On that day, thanks to me, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical failure and replaced it with another plane we had hoped for.
So I've had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I'm not gonna fool you.
The afternoon at the airport waiting for the trip is really boring, and there's no big help in books, magazines, iPhones, or even free-trade stores.
In recent times, however, more and more scientists and child development professionals have spoken out in favour of disability.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children, it is not so bad.
This forces the brain to withdraw from interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world, we are all standing in front of some screen, the advantages of being boring are beyond us.
Maybe we should be trying to get out of this?
Yeah.
There's no time at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
Earlier, I, like many others, thought that it was a waste of time when people had more leisure time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history of the University of Calgary, author of the book "Intrepreneurial History" (Board: A Live History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"Fucking can really be a very ancient story," he says.
The walls of Pompeii contain Latin inscriptions on the gap dated to the first century.
This remains an open question as to how we understand the gap.
The problem is, says John D. Istød, Assistant Professor of York University in Ontario, Canada, that the concept and vision of the gap have often changed.
After studying the research materials on this subject and questioning the task force of 100 people, Professor Istud and his colleagues came up with the following definition: "Sudden is when people "want, but can't do what they'd like."
The difference between fatigue and apathy, he says, is that the grieving person is not doing anything he wants to do.
You don't want to do anything when you're sick.
Mostly in the midst of distress, he said, it is “a violation of attention and the related deterioration of mood and the sense of slowness of time”.
The description of the scar may be very similar to depression.
However, Professor Istød argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, those who are bored see the causes of problems in the world and its circumstances and those who suffer from depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study “Unknowable Reason: Determining Disturbing Attention”, published in the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Istud and his colleagues referred to the previous experiment, whose participants heard a vote reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds that were not related to the television program included in the neighbouring room, others heard the same sounds in low thunder, so they could hardly be understood, and the third group only heard a voice without a sidetrack.
Those who heard a low - noise TV observed that they were bored, that others were more often hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to their embarrassment.
When we are trying to concentrate on a difficult or attractive task, the interruption of attention may cause a gap, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something of no interest, “for example, looking at the flow of goods on the conveyorium in search of a marriage, detracting music can help to avoid boredom.”
He continues that when people start climbing up the chair or drawing karacula on the paper list, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that such actions actually help not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to go back and forth learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit quietly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we are all bored: when the journey is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an interestless movie.
However, different people show a different degree of inclination to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special “scaling scale”.
Questions and allegations, such as “Many of what I have to do, uniform and monotonous” or “I’m too interested, so there’s no time for anything”.
Through such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are missing girls more often, says Steven Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are various external pollutants.
In general, however, adolescents are often bored.
In 1991, Reid Larson, professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day with the help of the pager.
He had received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said that they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said that they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of the parents noticed that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what kind of shock data would be, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “at an early age, there is a tendency to be embarrassed”, mainly because children and adolescents do not fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: Is this boring useful?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations it, as research shows, can induce people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical acts, gambling risks, or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to escape from boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; it's a joke," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, the same brain does not always know what to do.
If you're bored and you're going to make that energy into a guitar or a culinary experience, you're going to do better.
But if you stop watching TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll happen soon.
Therefore, if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills are in different situations”, he says.
Your child learns not only to take care of himself but also to learn self - control at all.
I don't think you need to carry something.
However, there is nothing wrong with her.
Rather, learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see this in such a way that we need to experience more boredom, while the boredom is an extremely unpleasant, inexhaustible desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get rid of the constant care and just relax.
"In today's world, we've become used to the constant incitement of the organs of emotions," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
How the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will apply
Anthony Orosko, a 19-year-old football team and a public college student in South-East Colorado, was accused of committing a criminal offence that would soon be completely legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and the tube where he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko said that once in September he and his friends were in Lamara and drove in a car on the outskirts of Kansas when they were stopped by the police.
After the police had found a marijuana car, Mr. Orosko had come to the drug storage court and had a fine of $100 for the small offences of which the date of the trial had been set.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks after the State of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts of entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases is not as much dependent on the law as on the place of consideration.
Small offences involving marijuana have already been reported in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already ceased to charge people at the age of 21 and older than holding small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force within a few weeks.
In more conservative districts, however, the prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana cases and continue to be responsible for the storage of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, there is a vote to prevent the emergence of new licensed marijuana stores in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to wait for," says Daniel J. Outs, police chief in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
The representatives of the controlling authorities in Washington, D.C., have also been entrusted with honoring heads.
They have to establish rules for the licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this has to be done by 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is driving the majority of other states into dealing with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Washington State Alcohol Control and Marketing Council.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith recognizes than to make some proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have the present precedent that we could focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will cast the state into uncertainty for the whole year when the State licensing system is not yet in place and the right of marijuana is already legalized.
There are still some simple technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade at 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed enterprises for the sale of marijuana in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established research group, “The Center for the Legalization of marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Outs from Aurora sent an e-mail message to his subordinates that the City Prosecutor's Office would no longer involve those who were 21 years of age in charge of the possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police would cease to prosecute people for these violations “as from this point of time”.
The Chief of Police reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the rules governing the activities of persons producing marijuana for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and drug distributors.
The District Attorney Wald in North Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he said that the prosecutor ' s office would continue to be responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage its users to take a course of treatment.
At this point, 119 persons have been charged with two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also accused of other violations.
"The responsibility of our institution is to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their execution," Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The response was even different in such places as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Jankshan police, the largest city in the county, no longer take responsibility for the small number of drug abuses.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to file charges for the custody of marijuana.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes - our direct duty," he says.
While 55 per cent of the population of the State of Colorado who participated in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the opposite reaction of residents in different parts of the state has led to a difference in the attitude of local authorities towards the state experiment with marijuana.
“There is a cultural barrier in the area of district prosecutors,” explains Sean Macalister, a Danish lawyer who represents the interests of marijuana detainees, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They have persecuted people so long because they can't really deal with it anymore," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states in which a small number of marijuanas belong, as well as alcohol, are destined to become an experimental field at the country level to examine the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalization partners and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but they are waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to consider the sale and development of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization partners of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will step up.
Despite a number of large-scale arrests of traders and patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government has in most cases made good use of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The drug-fighting officers will not be allowed to enter the house to confiscate a small marijuana package, but they will hardly be able to close their eyes on the state-regulated state-run marijuana store permitted under the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, former drug-fighting adviser to the Obama Administration.
Some cities in Colorado have not been expected to act by the federal authorities.
Prior to the presidential elections, some local administrations approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which could not have been opened earlier than a year ago.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, issued a six-month ban on marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we'll issue a license to someone, and then it'll cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella White: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described him as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogous to the ancient symposium that established two foundations of civilization -- freedom of thought and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of study at the Faculty of History of the West College of Oxford University at the end of the 1980s, I gathered the codends and left, which was the first scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cried.
Friends have been beaten up so much.
The Evening Standard said that I left college because I didn't like my peers having sex in the next room.
Author E. Norman Wilson joked that I was leaving because I had to drink from a bottle.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically wet and scared.
Not exactly because of my rather unusual name or what I learned in private school.
For one reason only, and in this glorious corner of enlightenment, it looked like this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now dead Woodrow White, was known as counsellor Margaret Tettcher, and I was myself a supporter of conservators.
You're going to ask why you should remember that now?
According to recent data, a new generation of law-centered students is suffering from the same scourge.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred for conservative students in Oxford was so strong that last week a group of such students needed the same protection of their rights as that provided to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the college of Corpus Christi in Cambridge say that they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only exacerbated the recent BBC 2 documentary on student policy “Wonderful: Young, Smart and Right” in which the conservators presented themselves to eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, the former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides in the Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and trust with a silver bead.
In other universities, conservators complain that they are making “teachers because of higher education fees”.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of Nottingham University, in an interview with one of the resurrected newspapers, said that "in the university environment there is an increase in the gap towards the left.
The people who do not know us before consider us to be cruel and cruel to the rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student from the Faculty of History of Corpus Christi, who was asked to strengthen protection, called the atmosphere "unnecessary", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, said that the attitude of the students' club towards those with rights-based views had deteriorated considerably.
"This poses a threat to both the intellectual discussion atmosphere and the normal life of the club members," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, with a slave and a stupendous 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was blabbering from hate to conservative party.
A year earlier, the university had voted against former student Margaret Tetcher for reducing the budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be unconcerned.
On the first days of the first week of the course, when students met each other and teachers, I first felt what I was waiting for.
I still didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the conservatory students' grass, but they were delighted to participate.
Political issues - strikers, privatization and disagreement by the Government to apply sanctions against the Government of apartheid in the UAR - have penetrated through the wooden panels of the auditorium wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss White," said the teacher, now late Harry Pete, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text gave me a hard time, I stopped.
Harry Pete was a very greedy man with a cake-like face.
"Why don't the atheists basically teach French or they just don't have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students have been assaulted.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some basic French lessons at leisure if you're not very busy going back to society," said Pete.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college I sat alone at lunchtime, and then someone bit me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-class student from the Faculty of English, who was introduced as a member of the Association of University Conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Those suspected of congratulating the conservators will be ridiculed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tetcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most first-class conservators claim to be Laborists."
Later, in the local pub, I tried hard to be hypocritical.
I insisted that you agree with what Margaret Tetcher says.
That's a mistake.
The principal of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Ethan, said, "You are the daughter of a Fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students caught up with his words.
I was exported, dirty.
"How do conservators deal with sex?" One of them asked.
- They're kissing each other, right?"
I felt like I must have felt gay before the end of the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the uniforms only under the cover of night?
Will I have to become a labyrinth and hide my beliefs?
The next three years have turned into hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservator but also for being a adviser to Tetcher on foreign policy and one of its spokespersons.
He almost didn't show up in college.
He despised him for the provinciality, tenderness and commitment to Marxist-determinist views of history.
In 1997, he took his position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents ’ home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unaccompanied capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his forty years of study, any political views were adopted.
"But this is the best university in the world," he said regretfully.
- They can't do that, but they can't do it in the dreary town...
Even my communist friends have always behaved in a way that is not true."
His wet eyes were blinded.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop college."
I was exhausted by constant trips to London and my emotional protection of the weak.
My friend, also a conservative, did not give up on pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar when the ordinary professor of history took me seriously as an enemy of the people, I decided to do the same.
In my heart burned with shame, I admitted that "I missed my parents" and called them "old fools."
The breathing wasn't long.
The last wheel in the roof of my career in Oxford was to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for the publications belonging to Rupert Merdok.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my persecutors surrendered.
When they left, I picked up my suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a placard and a trap.
But for eighteen years, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen prime ministers of the Toire, but also today is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of the University, in which equality and freedom of thought are appreciated.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Shiite", which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous Italian designers
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of taking part in the exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Shiite", a triumphal retrospective exhibition that brings together over 130 high-mode payments created by his "home" over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unrepeatable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of history, the only person who is "or Signor" Garavani, but it could not be written without his no-named clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world.
In the first room of this exhibition, open before 3 March, personal letters and photographs of the most famous aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-han to Lord Snoudon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social achievement: from the modest port from the town of Voger in northern Italy to the truce of the international elite.
To be in love with the Queen's court is nothing wrong with it.
"Even if they don't turn off their cigarette hooks about your beautiful cover, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baronessa Fion Tiesen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a unique host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come to his joke in Gstaad," explains former wife Hyney Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beauty of Marella Angelly or Evgen Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Maçai representing Valentino
The Argentine model, Valeria Maçai, resembles the charismatic model.
Once we went to dinner at his house, it was after showing fashion on the Spanish square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentine's style was displayed in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her clothing, in food, in music.
"Each one of Valentino's guests was able to feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", which started with the model in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his sketches are the present art," she concludes.
Parade of the Family
The life of Garavani is not a history of conquest but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was turned into a glamorous stage of 60 metres in length, offering a change of role: the visitor takes the place of the models and must define on the stage, the sarcasm of the "sighters" from the grass, which are rubbing the skulls of Valentino, such as the one that chose Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit used by Monica Whitty at Night, or a coat of silk and leather belonging to the Emperor Fara Diba.
In this audience there are such names as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxisis, Matte-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abaskal and modeler in 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is the first love, "it's impossible to forget."
I remember him very well.
These were pants, shirts, jackets and jackets from the 1971-72 autumn collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abaskal, one of the designer's museums.
"I cherish him for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duke of Ferria.
I like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they come to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and the Legislature of the fashion Patricia did Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget for the first time when she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, the time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first salary from Valentino to put him on a holiday in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red plate, with a bead, a corsage in the warehouse and a cut without a broom.
"It was a dream that had come to light," said the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is fashion-like, his passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday pay from a model with "maximum caution... because pay is not just pay, it's also a set of memories that accompany it."
"King" Modes
The big show at Somerset House is Marie-Shantal Miller's wedding pay for her wedding with Paulos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as called the silk model) to produce it from a silky ivory skin with an incrustion of the stomach, twelve species of different circles and a sleif in four and a half metres.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority in the specialized press, the pay is a high-moded turn of the late 20th century, "returning customers from high light."
For many years, the elite 'style of life' has been worn out, and Valentino is now her best representative.
The Knight of the Great Cross (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Royal Legion, has collected as many honors as any of his clients' wives.
"I've always drawn his attention to the darkness, his calmness, his precise and unmistakable appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was useless, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: miners with Kawach-Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health, weighing 70 kilograms of sulphur on the top of a volcano on the rocky tropics
There are people whose work is hell, and others who work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earns the life of the production of cheese in the Kawah-Ijgen volcano, located east of the island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends at the bottom of the crater, where the greenhouse gas rising from the ground stops in contact with the air.
The large pieces of cheese, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, are placed in two bamboo baskets, peel the baskets on the shoulders and carry them up on the rocky road.
Up to the top of the volcano, with a height of 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but the loaded trucks need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle, keep the balance and carefully sneezing the road so as not to retreat and fall off the cliff.
They know that one false step can lead to their life, as it did with a tourist from France who crashed a few years ago from the Kawah-Ijen rock.
The Kawah-Ijen miners earn 5 euros per kilogram of cheese they earn
On top, they travel between tourists who photograph them as if they were hanging out of the circus and, with heavy belts up, walk three kilometers to the weights that the mining company had heard above, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
It is the PT Kandi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better not say, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euros) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocentres) of petroleum production, because it is distributed in everyday life and used for the manufacture of spices, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the marking of sugar.
"As a rule, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk," explains Anto, who normally performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours each of them and eventually feels broken, but they allow him to bury 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a miser for such inhumane effort, it is three more than he would have earned in the field.
" The daily wage for miners is very high on local measures, where coffee is paid 15,000 rupees per day and average monthly earnings equal to two million rupees (167 rupees) " , explains the truck who used to work as a stoneman on the island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees per day and the area was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvanga, a town not far from the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as devastating as the cheese: "I married a girl with Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes coming down because of toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawach-Ijene, whose cheese has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's always coughing, and he's got eyes coming down because of the toxic gases that release the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
The punished young man could be a tourist guide, an officer, or a doorman at the hotel, but instead he does the mula work.
Among the dirty wooden huts with other carriers, it rises every day at two o’clock in the night because the cheese does not stop running at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
By throwing a challenge to the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, lighting himself up with a little lighthouse attached to his helmet that he bought himself for his money.
Approximately 400 carriers toss grain with serum on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high income, the mining company did not mechanize the production of cheese for cost savings and did not provide any equipment to carriers who worked on their own and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive part of 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) of the photo collection, which, along with an entrance ticket of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), the guardians of the vessel take from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people.
"It's a job for cattle, not for people," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old Korean carrier who spent three decades at Kawach-Igene since he left college.
He is able to raise up to 110 kilograms and believes that he will endure “as much as he can”, because he needs money to raise his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
While the cheese burns the throat and burns the eye when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so excruciating that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, obviously than their usual problems with breathing, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders that have been deformed under the weight of the corset.
By balancing the basket on the back, Unynik can now only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Each day, he and his associates produce 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks are transported to a warehouse in Tamansara, overcoming the distance of 18 kilometres per narrow valley.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unynik, wide-opening mouth where there's not enough teeth.
Of his five children, 30 years of age, also work as a carrier of shit.
Time passes, but poverty lasts forever from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what the human mules do with Kawah-Igen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporens accuse their career, stress and prices of housing and education in the absence of children.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm a Patriot husband, you're my wife Patriot, I'll fulfill our civil debt and create a life!
It may be incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of magic beads, but despite this - or possibly because of this - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of the rap that uses local phrases such as "Let's put bao (bulk) in the oven" to smile at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is confident that they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform “their national debt”.
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst people in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that it was the subject that we had to touch.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot, for example, to start ghosts with pheromones or to organize fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, to make a rap?
1.2 child
Anyone who doesn't realize it is so easy, it's the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservative of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below 2 is known as the percentage of replacements in 1976.
So why don't Singaporens have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office on Spouse Couples and Families of the National Population Management, said that the cause of “improvement education” and “a wider range of career opportunities”.
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options for living goals and priorities besides marriage and family creation," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of the number of holocausts and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in fertility in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to combat population reduction, is a source of resentment among the local population.
Singapore has a web site where there is barely hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are criticized for maintaining low-level wages and are reluctant to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singaporen ruling party was the worst result in the independence elections last year.
After the elections, an attempt was made to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unforeseen consequences
While the decline in fertility has a significant impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical and immigration costs, Singapore has also begun to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making an effort not to build such a small house.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
The City Development Guide has been able to control the number of small apartments known as the “subsidiary box” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are sold very well at 46 square meters.
However, there is the view that they can contribute to a healthy lifestyle and leave behind the incentives of the founders who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director General of EL Developers, says that their "substance boxes" are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are rented for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income increases.
However, he recognized that the new rules provided clearer guidelines for the planners who had previously put in charge if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporens working in the financial quarter of the centre, they did not seem to have a special effect.
"People are very stressed, housing expensive, as well as education, and this is why many people are putting it behind them," said the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," another young man says.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and prices of housing and education as a reason why they do not have children.
So, no matter how much the Government has tried to encourage its citizens to have children, as far as childbirth is concerned, the last word remains behind the Singaporens.
Online Personals - Online Personals
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is the property of a private or “personal life that has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to be faced when discussing situations on the Internet that are unlikely to be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriodico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term “something very mine”, in a personal plane, and “word and user name” when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't be uploading," says ten-year-old Jorge when he's trying to explain the importance of personal sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
At FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures from the game.
I'm having fun with my friends, too.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish inappropriate photos of the people who are surrounded by crime or to write insults or angry comments.
Jorge believes he knows 35 friends he has in FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is in charge, she has a password for one of the records.
I ordered Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just charge them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends faster," he says.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
You wouldn't be treated as someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This girl has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently she admits that she does not know 20 people added to her list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one came to him in trust and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pushed or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a successor to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
It's not strange for a boy to experience today as a cybermobbing.
One of my friends was blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to Jose, did not remove the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
It then explains the sequence of steps to set the record safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos of people in uncomfortable or confused situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I don't like people or if I want to.
"Although I know it's a cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and teacher for education and education, believes that in order to direct children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a tool for searching for information, but these sites have changed the rules of the game," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prenski, a professor of pedagogy at Yeel University and the author of work, Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are those, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be spread, published or said when maturity is not sufficient for that”.
"So let them be elected, while it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do this is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like it if they posted a photo of you like what you published about your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign photos of dinner, do you ask permission for other people to notice them?
And yet, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to conduct themselves online just as they do online.
The rules are the same.
"A person on the Internet conducts himself with respect, responsibility and other principles, as must be on social networks," she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Each of the paragraphs has good grounds for having discussions with children about the preconditions for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to spread or publish," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children not to speak to strangers.
The UNASUR Summit ends without the publication of the Lima Declaration
VI The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which had previously been declared binding and theoretically signed by the family.
While access to a document signed at the 6th regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR was repeatedly sought, sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after the closure but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at a certain time.
On text questions, they pointed out that the content was presented by President Oliant Umala of Peru during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit has always been limited.
During the day, only the video of the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press room without a sound, with a message of “closed meeting, sound prohibited”.
A small amount of information circulating among reporters was provided by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which led to the discontent of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Government of Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Umala's statement, not the official document that the summit had concluded.
Last October, Peru adopted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been declared, was not circulated, despite its insistent demand for the press.
The official website of ASPA can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have endeavoured to ensure transmission systems for all journalists, but have limited the availability of information to a maximum extent.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olianta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinner, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which began in The Hague on Monday to hear statements by both parties, under the indictment that Lima had brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently submitting to this international court," said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
“ Chile was, and will be, a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, pacts and international tribunals”, added Pinner, and welcomed Umalu ' s hand in the background of the flags of those two countries.
The two Presidents ' confirmation that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia protested this week of the Bogot Pact, which recognized that it had been subject to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice following a decision on the maritime borders of Nicaragua which it found to be wrong.
The summit took place in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 after the influence of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The Acting President, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening morning discussions and closing the summit, to be heard later in the afternoon in Lima.
The Head of State had read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and had been approved for 31 projects in South America, the estimated investment amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “the important steps towards the purpose of South American citizenship for which we are expanding the settlement agreement”.
He reported that efforts were being made to improve “cooperation against citizens’ mistrust and organized transnational crime, to increase the availability of medicines, low Internet access in all South America corners, and to take into account the overall and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant foundation but should serve to expand our production base and provide for the best future for our cities”, Umala added.
"We have decided to give a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the linkages of South America, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes," the Peruvian President said in a read-only communication.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru and were limited by cross-sectional axes in his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a long relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before joining the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to negotiate in a respectful manner on the issue of the sea as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice contested by Godot.
"After tomorrow (on Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they are scheduled to attend the new president of the country, Enrique Penjena Njeto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must be taught in Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is the goal in which “South America, in this case, must be studied in Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's public television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "as they are now almost one family".
It protected, in this context, a South American citizenship project that was approved by UNASUR countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as has already been done with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed himself as a proponent of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS), subject to a reduction in the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lectures will never take on any obligations, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and financed by the United States,” he said, urging Ecuador ' s founder WikiLeaks Julian Assangu.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he did not share his principles with him but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that, in his time, “there were certain suspicions that Assang would be extradited into a third country and that the process would not be observed”.
He also criticised Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for questioning the alleged sexual offence, while “sweden legislation alone considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made by the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of assanga ' s physical and mental deterioration.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the Ambassador told me he had a little legit problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What is really true is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to influx into small space without the ability to perform exercises in the air.
"It affects everyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the issue of asylum granted to Assan from June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a guarantee of integrity that would allow him to go to Ecuador was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the establishment of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, because assanja lawyer Baltasar Garson is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions," he said.
And he said, "If Britain provides security tomorrow, it will be over."
And if Sweden, as she has done well with her legislation and has done so in other cases, will question Ms. Assang in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or ask him about Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to prove herself a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that she did not tolerate “mediation, mistrust and lies that undermine freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not the exported villains, but the bad journalists who support survival, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that neither these journalists, "neither the bankers nor the bourgeois gegegemonas do exist in Ecuador", and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the following elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and should not tolerate opportunism and support for the conversions under the masquerade law," because in reality "this has undermined the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered the wish of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to hold negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the Hague International Court of Justice, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At this point, this decision is not being complied with.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be worked together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also looked forward to the successful conclusion of the dispute on the maritime borders, which are held in the same trial by Peru and Chile, and said that “it is proper for Latin America to address international institutions if two countries are committed to making a decision whatever it was difficult to do”.
With regard to the possibility of becoming a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to fight for the third round, he pointed out that he considered this opportunity “with greater optimism and joy, although sometimes it was rather difficult”.
Correa assured us that if she loses her election in February 2013, she will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political authority.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so that this responsibility has to be acknowledged," he said.
In the event of a victory, this would be my last term in the presidency, and then we'll get out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same thing.
"That's the solution," he confirmed.
Korea also referred to the new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routinely, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean an increase in the health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Nations Union (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Death from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
The factory was 21 years old when it was announced that its AIDS analysis had produced a positive result.
"It seems to me that they're deaf," he recalls, "it's hard, despite the whole doctor's touch, the moment.
Yonosha hid it from her family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified, he had already observed his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “old” patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he fell into many obstacles in 1994.
He has been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would be hard to believe that there were too few treatment options, too few knew about the disease, too little about the disease.
So, even the director of the Mexican Social Protection Institute's clinic did not want to say good-bye to him, “because he had been taxed.”
In other words, having AIDS at the time was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so, not with a poor quality of life.
However, not knowing their disease, many people still come when the virus has damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement at this point is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said HCG head of HIV, Heime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the level of immune damage of patients at the start of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years of age with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years of age when 500 CD4 is reported.
Simply put, the above means that those who are diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age will be able to live without problems under 75 years of age, according to these terms.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
Only 255 people in Halisko died in 2011 and 187 deaths have already been registered by May of this year; however, universal access to antiretrovirals has been claimed since 2005.
- Why are there flight permits so far?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least we haven't had a lack of medication for the last 12 years, the problem is that patients are coming very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He reported: “9 out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so that it can be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for mass detection, for all people who will be asked to do so.”
In their proposals, experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Halisko (COESIDA) and patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who sought to check in a private laboratory, were motivated only by what he did by his friend and, despite his youth, had already been at the AIDS stage and had even suffered from sarquo, a cancer outbreak, which was one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"I'm going to die anyway, I'd better get three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm good at asking, doing exercises, taking medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of jobs, I travel, I live an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and another person," said the Factory, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to move forward with his statement to those who are now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, in fear.
Let them check if there is a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV positive or better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Preservatives by attachment
The major gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens, according to Ricardo Salazar, a Guatemalan journalist who dealt with HIV-related problems.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In places about this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we were given one or two before, now we are given hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they to you?" The propagandist said, with the courage and conviction of social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be amended; that condoms be not only behind the edges and that hundreds of them be in public toilets in places where young people often visit.
This is not the promotion of divorce.
It was not about the payment of beer and the motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his direction.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisko
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) have been reported.
The State has 4th place in the national rating on new and summary cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV.
92% of the infections are sexually transmitted, 6% through blood, and 2% by peripheral route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision cancelling the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group through the production of competition in Mexico, the scenario establishes a rock precedent for any national subsidiary company in a neighbouring country with payment capacity problems.
It appears that the procedures in support of the survival of firms permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country as opposed to international agreements.
In practical terms, the decision by Judge Harlin Hail on 15 June in the North Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves unprotected Mexican firms in front of the possibility of arresting their property on the Rio Grande side.
However, the decision opens the door to the leading producer of glass in Mexico to be brought before the United States Supreme Court, showing three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge notes that creditors must be regulated by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings concern the competitive proceedings in Mexico.
The first paragraph refers to the abolition of international judicial cooperation in cases of non-payment of undertakings of a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Standardization of International Trade Law was established to that end, determining the United States Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter- firm vote, recognized in the critical mass of the debt production that had been held before the parent company of the Vitro branch, no majority would have been reached to approve the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws recognize this opportunity.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that reading the votes of the branches, in other words the Vitro creditors who fought against him in the United States courts, namely the funds of "storb" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are being dropped by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accused Vitro of a difficult situation that had occurred since 2008 in the face of the serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
As long as the Gonzalez Sada family has appealed to the Court of Appeal itself to have the vote taken before it, that is, five judges, in the light of only three votes.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be made, which will require a review of the case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Unfortunately, the court rejected a document aimed at the Government of Mexico as a friend of the curiae ("second court"), which described the process to be followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, indicating that it was exempt from the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambol on two sides: they're going to Vitro and they're going to go to the country.
General balance
Taking into account the complaints filed for several months by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the trade union association of aircraft pilots has already found a bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Dias Chaves Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Banks Commission and the securities charged with obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to provide reports to the Office of the Republic of the Republic concerning the operation carried out by the operator to withdraw from the trust fund of IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be used to purchase the shares of the Professional Management Company of the hotel.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
Assembled at the Caribbean University Forum, a group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the establishment of a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country of the isolated country, with a living area close to 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra was able to bring together the governors of the south-east zone to resist the monumental forces that were on the ground in part of the protected territories and posed serious threats to industry.
ACTA death
With regard to the Government ' s refusal to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counter-Fraud, known as an abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, has already gone into the archive.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has been disqualified from viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In order to settle long-term debts, without affecting the short-term, the Homex housing planner places Exchange certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical, with a bid for payment every 28 days.
Competival appears in the light
The NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, information technology leaders, a consortium with a commercial name Competival has just appeared in the light, will aim to market software cluster services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hetin Reyes Hector: "Basketball was my life"
The busy basketball traveler Hector Hettin Reyes has been involved in this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember basketball stories like Hector Hettin Reyes.
And before his brain bleeds into a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was loaded into sport for more than 60 years as a small-scale player, a high basketball player, a BSN officer and head of the Cubans Bayamona and the President of the Federation of basketball.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as I was President of BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during his visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't overdo this.
The walls of his house, almost all of his beautiful photographs and memorable things gathered for his long journey, testify to this.
Byamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he kept those who remembered his way through Cuba, starting in the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year speech was performed as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I have enjoyed most, because I have had the opportunity to be part of eight Cuban champions since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
It was many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN.
Since then, the leadership has become Kuko Ortis, who was the great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gin Bartov, who came here and was at Alabama University (Birming), said to me, "I have a very strong 6'7 game for you."
"Do you want?"
And that was the beginning of Minsy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who gained citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember what he said if Mincy brought the Bayammon championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Kowboev and Gauss championship, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I was the head of the federation.
Until then, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the National Assembly.
I remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the 1989 Olympics in Mexico.
Then he became the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place and it must have been bronze, if not the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best assembly you've ever seen?
She was among the best, as was what she won at the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite thing was that from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States, which was pretty much like the one that won the bronze at our world championship.
Not only did Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fiko Lopes and Piculina (Ortis), but also young Toniito and James Carter, Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Kihote Morales, who were unable to participate in the 90s due to knee trauma, played the team again.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personality, but which brought us gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing games such as Canito Nieves, Pablo Alise and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for the games temporarily removed for disorder at the Mar del Plata Pan-American Championship, we have won gold in spite of all the predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Pickulin Ortis.
Its performances on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin did.
And it's not taking his career into account in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I really like Leo Ariel's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous national assembly period between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you still doing?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, regionalize smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their area and against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff.
Now the boys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I'm listening to music, watching music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and going to basketball games.
And, of course, I'm enjoying my wife's company, Icabel, who's always been with me.
Larry Hegman's Actor Death
Larry Hegman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his leading role as John Ross Yuing, known as J.R., in the Dallas TV series, where he involved businessmen without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as oilman foreman J.R. Yuing in the Dallas TV series, was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening because of the complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros, a Dallas production studio.
"Larry came back to his favorite hometown of Dallas, playing again a flagship role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas on the label for Thanksgiving.
Linda Grey, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the series, was next to Hegman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, gracious and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," said Grey in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with a liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant fever and was transplanted.
Long before Dallas, Hegman became acquainted with television as a result of the role of a regular type in the I Dream of Jeannie, which was broadcast by NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl-gin who plays Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the role well-adjusted critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his master's interpretation of the amazingly repulsive J.R. that led Hegman to the top of glory.
The CBS drama series on the Yuingov clan and other characters in its surroundings went off in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create a forest around the episode, full of emotions in which Hegman's character is not heard, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars at risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at the time.
When the episode was answered in November 1980, an average of 41 million television viewers looked at it and turned Dallas into the second of the interviews of the entertainment programme in history, after the end of MASH in 1983, attracting 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine, who shot Mary Crosby.
J.R. interrupted and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hegman played Yuing as an unsatisfied corrupter with charismatic smile: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey) to be treated.
"I know what must be on J.R." said Hegman in 1988.
It must be said, "The honest citizen J.R. Yuing will rest here."
It's the only deal he's ever lost.
Victoria Principal, also a heroine of the original series, remembered Hegman Friday as someone "great both on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and unforgivable for millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has come to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown a few months ago with much success on the TNT channel.
Five episodes of the second season were completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements about what would happen with the series after Hegman's departure.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hegman.
He tried to be happy at the New York theatre stage in the early 1950s and then served at the UKU in England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities lived.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything there that would seem able to cause pain to anyone or affect them in any way," he said at the time.
After the transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be okay."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
There's a course that studies "The End of Light"
Every week, students study apocalyptic events, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when religious professor Stuart Sharme decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an unremarkable premonition: the end of the May calendar, December 21, for which many people were arrested as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharme didn't understand what he was expecting in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "long-Armageddon", and the growing conflict where Israel is being invaded, the place where Christian theorists finally believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If we analyze what's happening in the world right now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad for those who have apocalyptic mind.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the theme of "the end of the light" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Walker is reading the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are proposed that trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may erupt.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic subjects and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I've tried to tell the students what is likely, probably and impossible," said Walker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solari, associate professor of art and anthropology, joined to read a course called "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the light doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite “necessary destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and submit final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be held in the Apocalypse canon, which does not leave students with a different choice, except to work “until the very night on which the light is supposed to come to an end”, said Restall.
Courses have become quite popular.
"The cities are over in two hours," Restall said about his course for high middle school students, where 35 students were enrolled.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, 23-year-old student of Haddonfield's Department of Religion and Sociology, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic form of thought, worldly or religious, is only a matter of comfort or lack.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student at the Psychology and Nurse's Office, said he was watching all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach that," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students questioned -- not about the professor -- said he believed in the end of the day on 21 December.
"Our first project affected Mayan's prophecy, and in some cases we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student of the final course at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar," Restall said.
But he noted that there is apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has been around for centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dodgerty, professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question whether he knew about any course of "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, urging the higher court.
We have the mercy of the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time there had been talk of many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period on which the world would end.
Students and teachers are safe on that date.
Some said they were going to the party "end of the light."
"Maybe I'll call some of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old college student.
