Tom reads to his daughters.
My computer is expensive.
There was a smoke.
Tom worked at the hospital.
I remember.
Continue reading:
Keep going.
Don't move:
Sit tight.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Ask someone.
Look closer.
Keep your mouth shut.
We're the best.
Stop fighting.
It worked.
Don't yell.
Come on in.
Clearly, Tom is sad.
Tom gave up.
Tomorrow's gonna be hot.
Tom inspired.
Let's go.
Tom doesn't want to see how he talks to you.
They all came out.
Go, go, go.
I still think you cheated on me.
I just want to be able to say that I'm sorry.
Be careful.
He's gone.
Make the car nicer.
I don't want to go to school.
Be good.
Here you go.
You're so smart.
I'm ready to die.
Sit here.
How many years have you lived here?
Tom was dancing.
It doesn't matter.
They lied.
Tom flew.
My mother's home.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Stay calm.
Take a step back.
Of course:
How beautiful!
Do you think I should do that?
I can't believe it!
No one knows.
Write down your manuals.
What's your number?
It was a good shot.
Tom didn't go into the details.
Be careful.
Please, stop.
Tom was being harassed.
They laughed.
Keep this.
Tom took his breath.
They disappeared.
I can't stand to think about it.
Come on in time.
Are you going to go on vacation this year?
Come on.
Go a little bit further away.
The airline is only carrying out cargo transfers.
Tom broke up.
Where are you from?
Tom told me he didn't learn French at the university.
Sit still.
Look here.
Get out of here.
Is there anyone in the house?
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I hit Tom's face with violence.
I don't agree.
Keep dancing.
Don't look at Tom.
Tom did it by hand.
I sleep all day long.
Find Tommy.
Tom brought Merry home with his car.
Women change the world.
A little tall, please.
Tell her I'm asleep.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
Everyone laughed.
He's afraid of darkness.
I'm still not sure.
Fill it with water.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Let it go.
Someone's weird.
Finish it.
It was uncertain.
Do what I've asked.
It won't change anything.
I don't understand that at all.
Keep practicing.
Consider this.
What a shock.
Tom had to ask Mary for help.
Keep looking.
Keep going.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Have fun.
Sit tight.
Be content.
I don't know why Tom didn't come, and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
Don't read:
Stay focused.
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Feel this.
It helps.
Wait here.
Read it.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
I believe that you will succeed.
Come to us.
One day you'll understand.
Look at it.
How interesting.
Hang in there, please.
What books does Tom read?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three parts of the campsite in this area.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Tomorrow, Tom has to go to school.
Keep digging.
It's amazing.
Change your score.
Coffee, please.
He's really good at talking.
Nsty, please.
I looked around you.
Check it out.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Would you listen to me at all?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
This is a bird.
We're together.
Take everything.
Come to us.
You did the experiment.
Let me.
The apple's on the table.
Tom praises his new car with his head.
The contracts are already under discussion.
Don't say anything.
Look under the trees.
How can it be that you don't know?
Give it to me.
What a wonder!
They've grown fat.
Keep working.
Tom was exasperating.
I wanted to read that book all the time.
So do I.
Everyone laughed.
"Burth-califf, now considered the highest skyscrapers in the world.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Forgive us.
It was amazing.
He's walking.
Go back now.
The tree swims.
Get out of here.
Let it go.
Try again.
I'll give you five minutes to solve this problem.
What are you standing for?
Move a little bit:
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
When do you buy?
They won.
My mother's home.
Tom died as a result of a stupid accident.
Things have changed.
I gave up.
When do you buy?
Tom recovered.
How does this work?
Let's go.
Stop trying.
Follow him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be patient.
Let it go.
This doesn't matter.
I sat at home for a week.
I started living alone.
Take this.
Kiss me.
Are you kidding me?
Tom was wondering if it was worth discussing with Mary.
Tom doesn't give a sign.
Be ready.
Tomorrow will be hot.
Tom was laughing.
It's time to fly.
We've forgotten.
Now I need to see Tom.
Say, "Okay."
They started a few hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weak because of his blood loss.
Don't yell.
Be careful.
Try this.
Is there a man in the house?
Be reasonable.
Keep going.
Don't wait for us.
Translate the game.
Follow him.
I'm trying.
Tom needs something.
Change that.
When do you buy?
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
It's amazing.
Look again.
Who should give that?
Get up.
Stay there.
I talked to Tom last night.
Keep trying.
Can you translate?
Don't read.
They were swimming.
They called.
Tom doesn't pay attention to how he dresss.
It happens.
We were honest.
Tom and Mary walked through a crowd.
It can't be too late.
We were alive.
We work together.
Hold still.
Say, "Look."
Let me calm down.
Forgive us.
Keep dancing.
Keep it warm.
Think again.
We've forgotten.
We didn't get anything.
Dolls from the beginning.
I'm not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day you'll understand.
At the time, there were ancient people living there.
Finish it.
Tom was in trouble.
Oh, no!
It's going to be a silent movement.
It's clear.
Say it.
Look around you.
Stop arguing.
Tom came to help us.
My eye's gone.
Take it.
Stop them.
Start again.
Keep walking.
Tom closed his eyes and seemed asleep.
Put this on.
Protect yourself.
It's enough to apologize.
Everything is important.
Be careful.
Wait a minute.
Don't wait for us.
It happens.
They all yelled.
Let's not talk long and take action.
Tom laughed.
He cleaned the dust with dust.
This morning the temperature fell below zero.
Did you think I forgot?
Be yourself.
Be careful.
They waited.
Tell everyone.
Who do you want to ask?
What do you propose me to do?
I'm going down.
We're learning on the basis of experience.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
I'm sorry.
They danced.
Start writing.
Wait.
Throw that away.
They walked.
Just tell me why you're here.
Look around.
Tom woke up.
Cut the noise.
This is my choice.
Tom reads French better than I do.
Show me.
Tom's turn went.
Take this.
Tom was fighting.
Tom agrees.
Watch carefully.
It'll be easy.
Apres.
Tom suffered.
Did anyone get hurt?
Don't worry.
Tom doesn't carry a sign.
Sing with me.
Please, Tom.
I give my word.
No one answered.
It's not bad.
Sleep well.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom's never been in my house.
Let's go.
That's enough lies.
You have the right to have your opinion.
It's very funny.
All right.
Keep working.
Stop it.
Of course I can, even though I don't almost speak Shanghai.
I invested.
Let's find out how that's gonna help.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be just.
When did you tell me?
Be reasonable.
Tom is a very self-consuming man.
Tom agreed.
We didn't get close.
There's a tall man in the auditorium.
I'll watch TV.
Wait for me next to the car.
Tom tried to speak French to the seller.
Even if we get so late, it won't bother us.
Ask Tom.
Ask Tommy.
What a horrible thing!
Know I'm in love with Mary.
I don't agree.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Think about it.
Stay away.
Listen.
Does that sound stupid?
Tell me.
What's your name?
We remember.
Running as fast as I could, I could catch my friend.
We're going to have fun.
Tom doesn't put the sign.
Insects:
I waited.
Something's changed.
Tom's on the run.
We waited.
Wow.
Everyone knew.
Sleep well.
This box contains 5 apples.
I'm against it.
Tom asked us to be patient.
I didn't think he had the right to do that.
Tom made fun of her.
Don't pay attention to Tom.
It won't change anything.
No one made a wish.
I have to do something about it.
Think.
Ignore them.
A lot of workers were missing their fingers.
Keep looking.
And they're going out.
Keep pushing.
Can you speak French?
Look at us.
I can't stand it anymore.
Eat something.
Tom died three months before he finished college.
Tom was born.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home.
Have a good drink.
Join us.
Tom's swimming better than Mary.
Tekwi right.
You're right.
Start again.
They all smiled.
I'd like to know how this happened.
Keep it.
Let's tell you why we're here.
Anyway, thank you.
Yeah.
Tom's with his mother.
Stay away.
They disappeared.
He was going home fast.
Don't forget.
You can't do it without me.
Please, come on.
I deserve more.
Give it to me.
Keep going, please.
You were supposed to wait.
Don't move.
It helps.
Now I have to see Tom.
Forget him.
It's a good place today.
Do you know Tom's name?
Don't cry.
Please sing.
Let's do this.
I don't know yet. Did he get there or not?
You're so smart.
Tom disappeared.
No one came.
What are you standing for?
Oh, no.
Tom answered.
Stand there.
Tom called his neighbors.
Walk away.
I'll see you at school.
Take him.
Tom and Mary are left alone in the room.
Kiss me.
Try this.
Let's do this.
Keep moving.
Hurry up.
Squeeze.
Even green concerns are infuriated.
Keep them.
I see.
Hurry up.
What are they waiting for?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Go tomorrow.
Stand there.
Say, "Please."
There's a bad herd coming out of it.
We're trying.
Tom can go to the club any minute to hear how Mary sings.
Tom liked Australia.
Take measures.
The tree is green.
Don't be angry.
Read this.
Be satisfied.
It was uncertain.
It's going to stand.
Shut up.
I think I left something in the audience.
One day you will understand.
Do what I've asked.
I was in shock.
It works.
Be careful.
Do you know Tom's name?
Tom was crying.
Stay here.
The flowers bloom.
That's funny enough.
Get me the paper.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Come on in.
Tom wants a new car.
Here you go.
Someone got mixed up.
Mary said.
Start singing.
Answer me.
It worked.
We forgot.
Wow, Su.
Take a step back.
Sit down, please.
What's the difference?
A language is never fickle.
They understood.
Listen.
Tom came back to the room.
I still think you cheated on me.
Keep working.
There's no problem.
Finish this.
Tom was weird.
There's kids playing in the garden.
Think again.
When do you buy?
Let's do it.
There's no room for this.
Why are we running?
Put your hands on him.
They all smiled.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom fought.
The faces are waving.
We made a promise.
It happened.
Sit here.
Hold on.
Tom invited me to go with the movie star Mary.
Get ready.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
What?
Hello, Tom.
Be sure.
It's been years.
Get dressed.
Tom forgot.
I like it here.
If the alcohol is going to weaken my head, I'm going to take a few pills instead of this terrible drug.
Tom really respects you.
I said some things I didn't want to say.
Look here.
Good world!
I've never eaten horse meat.
Let's not talk long and take action.
Do you want to see what's new?
We were saved.
A tackey.
Let go.
They kissed.
Tom and I will go together.
Marry me.
You better go home as soon as possible.
They say Tom Jackson is one of Boston's best lawyers.
Excuse me.
End game:
They approve.
It's just your opinion.
Fill the cat with water.
You're the leader.
Tom begged us to be patient.
Healthy food is important to a healthy body, a healthy consciousness, and the result is to have the most effective.
Let's go.
He believed the truth.
Tom looked.
Shampain, please.
Stay here.
I don't fit in with the details.
Don't get up.
They all prayed.
They all started to laugh.
Tom was red.
No one asked.
Speed:
All right, Tom.
Smile, please.
Be honest.
I'll see you at work.
Tom, tell me.
Take a look at it.
Put this on.
I looked there.
Keep it.
I live in East.
I'll get in the car.
Take these.
You're running.
Don't yell.
You don't do anything but eat.
Don't do it, Tom.
Look at them.
Don't look at them.
They were busy.
He got married last year.
Tom made a link to my website from his blog.
Stand still.
Leave everything.
This is my choice.
Tom's gone.
Let's tell you why we came.
You're running.
Well that's another case.
Please sing.
Have you been here all night?
You better get back.
It's time.
Toulouse:
I doubt that's what happened.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
Stay away.
Keep them.
Nobody pays attention.
Stay away.
Come back.
Will you come for a minute?
Sing with me.
Tom often heard about Mary, but he hasn't met her yet.
Wait a minute.
Leave Tom alone.
Leave Tom alone.
Stop it.
Crayons don't have teeth.
He disappeared.
Let's go.
Tom heard.
Tom wanted to sleep for a long time, but he couldn't sleep.
Last seen:
Start here.
That's funny enough.
Be kind.
Be prepared.
Tom was breathing.
Tom gave up.
How many years have you lived here?
Does it look like animous?
Can you speak French?
Keep it warm.
I thought Mary still loved me.
Stay here.
That's really impressive.
I don't know.
Mary ran.
Try again.
I slept a lot.
I get it.
Forget Tom.
Thank you.
Take him.
Sit down.
Don't yell.
Start writing.
Every person's work, whether it's literature, music, painting, architecture, or anything else, is always his face.
No noise.
Everything's changed.
Ask Alex.
There's always options.
You were supposed to wait.
Let's do this.
I'm out of work.
What are you trying to do?
Stay here.
It helped.
Where are you from?
Keep digging.
I miss you.
That's enough of a dispute.
I got it wrong.
Let's go.
Tom can go any minute to listen to the team singing Mary.
It's cold.
Stop it.
We don't need Tom.
I finished my homework when you called me.
Do you have plans for the evening?
I'm not tired.
Keep going.
How amazing!
Prepare:
Tom's gone wrong.
What's your favorite bird?
Tom is a very beautiful man.
Call us.
How about a movie?
Remember this.
These things aren't mine.
We're lost.
Take me.
Call me.
He was yelling.
What's interesting?
Who died?
Stay here.
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do.
Forget Tom.
Sit down.
Slow food:
I'll try again.
Tom went.
We forgot.
Tom has to thank me.
I'll be right back.
Let's go.
Hurry up, please.
Be kind.
Don't worry.
Be patient.
Everyone was alive.
Speak clearly.
He tried.
Gather yourself together.
Speak clearly.
It's a numerator.
Who knows?
Sit here.
I love apples the most.
I'm working.
Do you have any more detailed maps?
I got a message from Tom.
Tom looked in Mary's eyes.
Tom paid.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
The bread is fresh.
I want Tom to be killed.
Tom died.
Please specify the terms and conditions of your use of this information.
Be reasonable.
After you:
I just ignore them.
What does Tom read?
Look first.
Stand still.
I can do the math.
Don't worry.
Protect yourselves.
You've had patience.
Everyone's dreaming.
Thank you.
Tommy was in the hospital.
Keep talking.
I forgot.
Forgive me.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Check this out.
Go a little further to it.
Finish this.
Open the fire.
Do you have any details?
Tom is much stronger today.
Fire.
Excuse me, can I leave a message?
Take me.
Please, let's go and give it to me.
It'll be wonderful.
I drink milk.
Oh, my God.
It can't be too late.
Keep reading.
Even if he doesn't come, we have to start.
Don't get up.
Tom was asleep.
Tom can't accept your gift.
First Tom hated Boston.
It's offensive.
Everything's changed.
Tom heard how they named him.
Stay away.
Tom's dead.
You've got to resist.
Tom looked at his watch.
Speak loud.
Ask different people.
The wood is burning.
Let him go.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you now.
Be respectful.
Stop arguing.
I can't let you do this.
Please don't mention my name.
Gather yourselves together.
It's nice to see that girl.
Are you calling something right now?
Seventy-eight years is the normal life span.
Forgive me.
Call me.
Hurry up at home.
Sit still.
Stay down.
Don't move.
Is there a man in the house?
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Use warning tools.
Speak loud.
Well, I'll see you.
Tell Tom.
Did I miss something?
Tom knows.
Snow came.
You can't do it without me.
That's enough.
Tell everyone.
Speak clearly.
Answer me.
When did you tell me?
Is it normal if I sit here?
Keep writing.
Tommy thought he was adorable.
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Keep trying.
Come back soon.
I'm sorry.
The decision was made.
My knife is a sword.
I left Tom out.
I got it.
That's right.
I drink tea, too.
Tom stood there waiting for him to cross the street full of traffic.
I just want to be able to apologize.
Be quiet.
I don't remember what I ate last night.
Try it.
Ask Tom about it.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom ran away.
Let go of the fire.
They were subjected to it.
Tom is proud of his new car.
Change your shoes.
It's time to fly.
Tom would like to go to Mary's tonight.
Take these.
Keep smiling.
I can always sleep wherever I am.
How deep?
Let's start now.
Tom laughed.
Tom made fun of her.
I woke up.
Let him go.
Let's get closer.
Let it go.
I'm sorry.
Do I have one?
Don't move.
Tom came out.
Tom won.
Tom's gone.
Stay positive.
We hope to arrive in time.
Tom advised Mary to go as soon as possible.
Stay focused.
Tom will kill again.
Keep fighting.
I'm saying.
Remember that.
Listen carefully.
He helped.
You're multilingual.
Don't come in.
Take that.
Tom worked at the hospital.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
These details will not be published.
They were all proud.
Welcome to Wikipedia
Does anyone know if the dining room is open or not?
The woman is in the room.
Take him.
Tom's trying hard to translate.
Keep running.
He wants to drink some hot milk.
Wait, please.
Help me.
Are you doing something right now?
What?
I like to be sad, and I know that most people are trying to avoid any kind of sad feeling, but I think it's wrong.
Round:
I have to translate the sentences.
How tragic!
Everyone was waiting.
What a strange thing.
Don't worry.
Stay calm.
A debater about the details.
It worked.
Be creative.
Be careful.
Don't move.
What a match!
I confessed.
You have to sign this.
Be careful.
First row:
I don't care what you do with it.
Let's think about it a little bit.
Why didn't you write me?
Listen.
They all blew up.
Get out of here.
Tom has a very creative spirit.
Stand still.
Do you have any object on this plan?
Ask different people.
Tom failed.
Hello, Tom.
I'm sorry.
Smash it.
I didn't even think you liked Tom.
I love you.
It's you.
I have to get that trigger.
I'm sorry.
You better get back.
They yelled.
Let's draw together for my mother.
Hurry up, please.
I have two cats.
Don't say anything.
Please, stop.
What a tragedy!
We'll spend a good time in Boston.
I lost.
He was running.
We understand.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Be careful.
Don't yell.
Smile at me.
No one died.
Tom helped.
Take this.
Grab him.
Italo Calvino returned to Italy while he was still a child.
What do you propose me to do?
Get in touch with Tom.
Start.
Don't yell.
What will one finally help or not?
You speak French?
Let her go.
Sign here.
Have you ever been to America?
Wait a minute.
Tom flew up.
Be careful.
Don't go after dark.
Tom did it on his own.
Why did you stop me?
It's an old name.
I know.
Don't yell.
I don't know anything about this.
I've lost my mind.
Thank you.
He's speeding up.
Follow me.
Good evening.
What's wrong with me?
Hold on.
Oh, my God.
Put this on.
Tom said he'd be a few minutes late.
None of my friends drink coffee.
Stay close.
Don't yell.
I don't have any more time to talk to you.
I can't translate into what happened.
Etri:
Tom cried.
Stop talking.
Tom blew out.
Don't worry.
You don't have to do it again.
Let's go.
Chris is very attractive and rich, but not very modest.
Good dreams!
Take care.
What a match!
Don't say anything.
Why?
He worked.
Tom's drinking.
The mother was proud.
How old is your dog?
Tom was saved.
I like the ACP language.
Tom was wondering.
Stop arguing.
Let's move a little bit.
Do you have a dictionary?
Wash.
They were shouting.
Get up.
Google Translate cannot translate expressions or define individual words.
Keep going.
Help me.
What's your favorite bird?
We wrote volunteer.
Take Tommy.
Do it.
They're gone.
Take him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
It really shocked him, and he didn't want to talk about anything for a while, and I think he'd be long enough to get back to normal.
Stay calm.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom doesn't know how to speak English everything he wants.
Be respectful.
Tom says there's no problem.
Mr. Yoshida's got a very good head out of France's history.
Good year.
Follow Tom.
Stop yelling.
Take that.
All right.
Can you translate?
Work in tandem.
We know all the details.
Keep writing.
Don't worry.
Come on.
I'm doing my lessons.
Stop laughing.
I don't imagine life like that.
Get up.
Thank you all for coming.
Tom was listening.
Write me.
Would you listen to me?
He was at work.
We're going to have fun.
Follow me.
I don't know the details.
Take Tom.
Tom laughed.
It happened.
Don't burn.
Keep moving.
Tom called.
They were burned.
Let us go.
Get up.
Nobody's listening.
Tom drives a car.
They understood.
Take this.
Thank you.
What?
Be careful.
What doesn't matter is how much it's worth, I'll buy it anyway.
Everything changes.
I'm sorry.
Take this.
We know.
I couldn't understand his thoughts.
It's a nuisance.
They're cheating.
It's not easy.
Home call.
They rested.
Where did you send the tickets?
Shut up.
Have fun.
Tom had a cake for Mary.
We slept.
Together with us.
Here you go.
It's my greatest happiness to read.
There's a bad herd coming out of this.
Excuse me?
Tom's not useless.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom wasn't happy to see that Mary.
I also drink tea.
Try again.
I agree.
Keep going, please.
Please, listen.
I gave up.
Get out.
It works.
How many of you are there?
Look closer.
Tom needs to know what's in front of the ban.
He looks happy here.
The man sitting there is a famous singer.
Call us.
I just can't make the proposal.
I find it very easy to talk to Tom.
Someone called.
Everything's broken.
Here's the horse.
I know Jim from childhood.
You have to sign this.
I thought he was coming.
Tom cheated.
He came.
He's coming.
Who are we going to give it?
I'm sorry.
Tom said he'd help me.
Stop yelling.
I confirmed it.
Touch left.
Come on.
Don't stand up.
Really?
Why are they so evil to us?
Stop shooting.
Keep walking.
